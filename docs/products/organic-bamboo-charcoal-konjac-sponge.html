            <li>I received this at a discount for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>I really liked this sponge.</li>
            <li>It comes in a scratchy, pumace like state when it arrives, and needs to be soaked or ran under warm water for about a min or two before using.</li>

            <li>and I love the Konjac Sponge.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this konjac sponge.</li>
            <li>I wanted to write further about the buying process because I&#x27;ve been really impressed.</li>
            <li>and if it&#x27;s safe for ezcema.  </li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li>I received this product free in exchange for my honest opinions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I always rinse my scrub after using it, to get the soap residue off, by running it under warm water and lightly squishing it between my two hands until most of the water runs out.</li>
            <li>I wish it were a bit more durable, but it is a sponge.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love the way this makes my face feel.</li>
            <li>Will gladly purchase again</li>
            <li>I am buying several more!!!</li>
            <li>Very excited to recommend this.</li>
            <li>First time I used it I loved it.</li>
            <li>Gentle and effective !</li>
            <li>It was good for the first couple of uses but it fell apart after about 10 days.</li>
            <li>It works just as well as my original sponge!</li>
            <li>Super nice in the shower.</li>
            <li>After soaking as instructed it became so very soft and felt Great on my face and neck.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the shape of it as i am able to get rid of any flakey skin around my nose area.</li>
            <li>After putting in water it gets soft and works great on your face.  </li>
            <li>Works fantastic love it</li>
            <li>Okay, so I don&#x27;t even know where to start with this fantastic product, but here goes:</li>
            <li>I had no expectations for a konjac sponge to work, you do not need to add anuthing and it does remove all your makeup, and dead skin, leaving you with a soft and clean face, very good size and perfect for night or day</li>
            <li>easy to use with/ without soap when your cleaning your face</li>
            <li>It feels very very mildly abrasive.</li>
            <li>I do own a facial brush that does a good job of cleaning my face, but in a pinch this will do</li>
            <li>When used on your face a konjac sponge is the most gentle, yet effective exfoliator I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this both with and without a cleanser, and both ways work fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super gentle and perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This little sponge is awesome!  </li>
            <li>Gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t do well with anything that isn&#x27;t fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>makes my face so smooth</li>
            <li>You can hold it under running water or, to save water, stick it in a container filled with water.</li>
            <li>Gentle but effective.</li>
            <li>My skin feels fantastic, yours should too.</li>
            <li>Perfect size, not too harsh.</li>
            <li>(there&#x27;s a little string on the sponge, which is convenient and I love) and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wanting to get one of these for a long time, as I&#x27;ve always heard great things about them.</li>
            <li>I was definitely excited to try this...</li>
            <li>Who knew something so simple can be so effective!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product at first,  </li>
            <li>The sponge gives the perfect amount of physical exfoliation and so far has kept its form.</li>
            <li>I like how it makes my skin feels super smooth.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s purpose, but wasn&#x27;t wowed in terms of getting my face really clean.</li>
            <li>This won&#x27;t exfoliate (unless you use it with a face scrub, which I wouldn&#x27;t as it might damage the sponge&#x27;s fibers) or remove makeup (unless you use it with a cleanser), but it will leave you with a clean face that isn&#x27;t stripped or raw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>Second time I used it wasn&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li>..seem to smooth everything out and made my skin feel so glowing and fresh ..nice product.</li>
            <li>Glad I finally got up the courage to try it :)</li>
            <li>so glad I found this product &amp; I would/will highly recommend it to anyone/</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on my skin and it removes all of my make up fairly easily.</li>
            <li>Love this sponge, It leave my face very soft.</li>
            <li>Very soft and really does a nice job at exfoliation and invigoration</li>
            <li>I rarely get pimples</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice that it will decompose and does not have a big environmental impact.</li>
            <li>Received this in the mail pretty quickly along with an email explaining how to use it.</li>
            <li>When I use it with a facial cleanser, it works just as well &amp; it rinses out very easily.</li>
            <li>Love this sponge, it leave your face very soft and you can use it even without saop, since it is made of a100% natural root, its natural components are good enough to clean, exfolite and soft your skin by itself, but you also can use with your favorite saop or cleanser.</li>
            <li>Had never used one before but it is very straight forward.</li>
            <li>Last night, I used this, without cleanser, to clean my face of a light application of mineral powder foundation...</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend the product but more so the company.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time trying something like this.  </li>
            <li>Its my first time using a konjac sponge</li>
            <li>Then just gently squeeze the excess water out, and massage your face with the sponge!</li>
            <li>My skin looked clearer, smoother and softer after the first use.</li>
            <li>I use it with and without soap and either way my face feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Even on its own (with just water to soften it), it really feels like it cleans my face &amp; is gentle enough not to cause irritation, redness, etc...</li>
            <li>Use as directed for great results , smoother skinand small wrinkles are disappearing!  </li>
            <li>My face felt really clean and soft afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I used it too and also felt the positive effects of this Konjac Sponge.</li>
            <li>This sponge does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, which is wash my face gently.</li>
            <li>When first using the product I saw no signs of the charcoal, but I really didn&#x27;t purchase this item for that.</li>
            <li>Update: much to my surprise after my review was up</li>
            <li>Appearances can be very deceiving...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know the chemistry of how this works, but all I care about is that it really works, and</li>
            <li>and it is really helping my skin.</li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>but I really like it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Just emerge in water for about a minute and then gently use to exfoliate the face.</li>
            <li>A few days later I got another email from the distributor making sure the product was still satisfying me.</li>
            <li>It also feels very soothing and relaxing.</li>
            <li>I love that it exfoliates my skin without it feeling rough like some scrubs can.</li>
            <li>Both my wife and I highly recommend this sponge!</li>
            <li>is getting a gentle exfoliation when I use it.</li>
            <li>but it also does feel like it&#x27;s gently exfoliating my skin.</li>
            <li>It definitely has a unique texture.</li>
            <li>There were no instructions, and no &#x27;pretty&#x27; or appealing packaging at all.</li>
            <li>I use my sponge with my facial cleanser and it gives me the clean I am looking for.</li>
            <li>Such as describing how to clean the sponge</li>
            <li>little scrubby is fun and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I love that it is natural bamboo, and the string to keep track of it in the shower (which also helps in allowing it to dry correctly).</li>
            <li>They also included some frequently asked questions about the sponge that were really helpful!</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves how soft and moisturized her face feels now!</li>
            <li>I like this sponge, however I think the price is high for what you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li>Wow!!</li>
            <li>I love this little sponge.</li>
            <li>Kind of hard to explain,</li>
            <li>It really does make your face feel really soft.</li>
            <li>While I haven&#x27;t taken it on travel, I think it will be useful as such.</li>
            <li>When my face dried it was so smooth, glowing,  and even felt moisturized somehow!</li>
            <li>It really smoothed out my skin with just a few uses and its so easy to use that there is no reason not to add it to my morning routine.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to ridding my bathroom clutter of bottles of cleansers and lotions and replacing them with this one deceptively simple and effective little thing.</li>
            <li>I have not gotten it yet and will update this review after using a new one</li>
            <li>How did I live without this?</li>
            <li>My skin tends to get red with the clarasonic so finding an alternative in the AM that did the job but didn&#x27;t make my skin too mad is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>it left my pores free of any residue and my skin actually felt soft and silky afterwards.</li>
            <li>It is no ordinary sponge.</li>
            <li>I have needed something like this for a long time but just couldn&#x27;t find the right something.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t attribute to its success with anything else because I haven&#x27;t used it for very long but</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this Charcoal Konjac Sponge for my wife as she is always looking for beauty aids to help keep her facial skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li>Made a huge mess.</li>
            <li>I had hopes that this product would help me keep blemish free, but it wasn&#x27;t enough by itself, or even adding my normal cleanser (which works for me in the summer using other means).</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant to use it because it felt so hard, but once it&#x27;s wet, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>However, I rinse it out thoroughly after every use &amp; the water runs clear...</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and allergies</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling really soft.</li>
            <li>My 1st time trying a facial sponge like this, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to..</li>
            <li>This product surprised me.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate the extra effort made by the seller.</li>
            <li>I soaked it in water as directed, then gently scrubbed my entire face in a circular motion.</li>
            <li>I think this Konjac sponge would work wonders for most people with normal to small occasional blemishes.</li>
            <li>It becomes really soft and spongy after its soaked.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice any change in my skin/complexion, but will continue to use the sponge - if nothing else, for the psychological benefits.</li>
            <li>was so surprised how it made my face feel</li>
            <li>No really go buy this right now.  </li>
            <li>I personally like to use this with my face wash, just to lightly scrub away the dead skin cells every morning.</li>
            <li>I love this little sponge, it gets into the hard to get to crevices like around the nose but does its cleaning gently.</li>
            <li>I never would have believed that this hard lump would leave my skin feeling smooth, hydrated and silky without trying.</li>
            <li>My skin gets rough fast and my nose is prone to blackheads.</li>
            <li>and and it is refreshing to see a company that stands behind their products and their customers.  </li>
            <li>When it is wet it gets very soft and pliable and feels like it has a natural oil that comes from it almost.</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t  worth the price because the sponge practically desolves after only a few uses.</li>
            <li>I was a little disappointed that the item didn&#x27;t come with any detailed instruction, and honestly didn&#x27;t spend the time to research it.  </li>
            <li>Wet is a very soft sponge for exfoliating 3)</li>

            <li> and if it&#x27;s safe for ezcema.  </li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li> I received this product free in exchange for my honest opinions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always rinse my scrub after using it, to get the soap residue off, by running it under warm water and lightly squishing it between my two hands until most of the water runs out.</li>
            <li> I wish it were a bit more durable, but it is a sponge.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my face feel.</li>
            <li> Will gladly purchase again</li>
            <li> I am buying several more!!!</li>
            <li> Very excited to recommend this.</li>
            <li> First time I used it I loved it.</li>
            <li> Gentle and effective !</li>
            <li> It was good for the first couple of uses but it fell apart after about 10 days.</li>
            <li> It works just as well as my original sponge!</li>
            <li> Super nice in the shower.</li>
            <li> After soaking as instructed it became so very soft and felt Great on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the shape of it as i am able to get rid of any flakey skin around my nose area.</li>
            <li> After putting in water it gets soft and works great on your face.  </li>
            <li> Works fantastic love it</li>
            <li> Okay, so I don&#x27;t even know where to start with this fantastic product, but here goes:</li>
            <li> I had no expectations for a konjac sponge to work, you do not need to add anuthing and it does remove all your makeup, and dead skin, leaving you with a soft and clean face, very good size and perfect for night or day</li>
            <li> easy to use with/ without soap when your cleaning your face</li>
            <li> It feels very very mildly abrasive.</li>
            <li> I do own a facial brush that does a good job of cleaning my face, but in a pinch this will do</li>
            <li> When used on your face a konjac sponge is the most gentle, yet effective exfoliator I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this both with and without a cleanser, and both ways work fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super gentle and perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This little sponge is awesome!  </li>
            <li> Gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t do well with anything that isn&#x27;t fragrance free.  </li>
            <li> makes my face so smooth</li>
            <li> You can hold it under running water or, to save water, stick it in a container filled with water.</li>
            <li> Gentle but effective.</li>
            <li> My skin feels fantastic, yours should too.</li>
            <li> Perfect size, not too harsh.</li>
            <li> (there&#x27;s a little string on the sponge, which is convenient and I love) and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to get one of these for a long time, as I&#x27;ve always heard great things about them.</li>
            <li> I was definitely excited to try this...</li>
            <li> Who knew something so simple can be so effective!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product at first,  </li>
            <li> The sponge gives the perfect amount of physical exfoliation and so far has kept its form.</li>
            <li> I like how it makes my skin feels super smooth.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s purpose, but wasn&#x27;t wowed in terms of getting my face really clean.</li>
            <li> This won&#x27;t exfoliate (unless you use it with a face scrub, which I wouldn&#x27;t as it might damage the sponge&#x27;s fibers) or remove makeup (unless you use it with a cleanser), but it will leave you with a clean face that isn&#x27;t stripped or raw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> Second time I used it wasn&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li> ..seem to smooth everything out and made my skin feel so glowing and fresh ..nice product.</li>
            <li> Glad I finally got up the courage to try it :)</li>
            <li> so glad I found this product &amp; I would/will highly recommend it to anyone/</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on my skin and it removes all of my make up fairly easily.</li>
            <li> Love this sponge, It leave my face very soft.</li>
            <li> Very soft and really does a nice job at exfoliation and invigoration</li>
            <li> I rarely get pimples</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nice that it will decompose and does not have a big environmental impact.</li>
            <li> Received this in the mail pretty quickly along with an email explaining how to use it.</li>
            <li> When I use it with a facial cleanser, it works just as well &amp; it rinses out very easily.</li>
            <li> Love this sponge, it leave your face very soft and you can use it even without saop, since it is made of a100% natural root, its natural components are good enough to clean, exfolite and soft your skin by itself, but you also can use with your favorite saop or cleanser.</li>
            <li> Had never used one before but it is very straight forward.</li>
            <li> Last night, I used this, without cleanser, to clean my face of a light application of mineral powder foundation...</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend the product but more so the company.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time trying something like this.  </li>
            <li> Its my first time using a konjac sponge</li>
            <li> Then just gently squeeze the excess water out, and massage your face with the sponge!</li>
            <li> My skin looked clearer, smoother and softer after the first use.</li>
            <li> I use it with and without soap and either way my face feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Even on its own (with just water to soften it), it really feels like it cleans my face &amp; is gentle enough not to cause irritation, redness, etc...</li>
            <li> Use as directed for great results , smoother skinand small wrinkles are disappearing!  </li>
            <li> My face felt really clean and soft afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I used it too and also felt the positive effects of this Konjac Sponge.</li>
            <li> This sponge does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, which is wash my face gently.</li>
            <li> When first using the product I saw no signs of the charcoal, but I really didn&#x27;t purchase this item for that.</li>
            <li> Update: much to my surprise after my review was up</li>
            <li> Appearances can be very deceiving...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know the chemistry of how this works, but all I care about is that it really works, and</li>
            <li> and it is really helping my skin.</li>
            <li> Really like it.</li>
            <li> but I really like it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Just emerge in water for about a minute and then gently use to exfoliate the face.</li>
            <li> A few days later I got another email from the distributor making sure the product was still satisfying me.</li>
            <li> It also feels very soothing and relaxing.</li>
            <li> I love that it exfoliates my skin without it feeling rough like some scrubs can.</li>
            <li> Both my wife and I highly recommend this sponge!</li>
            <li> is getting a gentle exfoliation when I use it.</li>
            <li> but it also does feel like it&#x27;s gently exfoliating my skin.</li>
            <li> It definitely has a unique texture.</li>
            <li> There were no instructions, and no &#x27;pretty&#x27; or appealing packaging at all.</li>
            <li> I use my sponge with my facial cleanser and it gives me the clean I am looking for.</li>
            <li> Such as describing how to clean the sponge</li>
            <li> little scrubby is fun and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love that it is natural bamboo, and the string to keep track of it in the shower (which also helps in allowing it to dry correctly).</li>
            <li> They also included some frequently asked questions about the sponge that were really helpful!</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves how soft and moisturized her face feels now!</li>
            <li> I like this sponge, however I think the price is high for what you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li> Wow!!</li>
            <li> I love this little sponge.</li>
            <li> Kind of hard to explain,</li>
            <li> It really does make your face feel really soft.</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t taken it on travel, I think it will be useful as such.</li>
            <li> When my face dried it was so smooth, glowing,  and even felt moisturized somehow!</li>
            <li> It really smoothed out my skin with just a few uses and its so easy to use that there is no reason not to add it to my morning routine.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to ridding my bathroom clutter of bottles of cleansers and lotions and replacing them with this one deceptively simple and effective little thing.</li>
            <li> I have not gotten it yet and will update this review after using a new one</li>
            <li> How did I live without this?</li>
            <li> My skin tends to get red with the clarasonic so finding an alternative in the AM that did the job but didn&#x27;t make my skin too mad is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> it left my pores free of any residue and my skin actually felt soft and silky afterwards.</li>
            <li> It is no ordinary sponge.</li>
            <li> I have needed something like this for a long time but just couldn&#x27;t find the right something.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t attribute to its success with anything else because I haven&#x27;t used it for very long but</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this Charcoal Konjac Sponge for my wife as she is always looking for beauty aids to help keep her facial skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Made a huge mess.</li>
            <li> I had hopes that this product would help me keep blemish free, but it wasn&#x27;t enough by itself, or even adding my normal cleanser (which works for me in the summer using other means).</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to use it because it felt so hard, but once it&#x27;s wet, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> However, I rinse it out thoroughly after every use &amp; the water runs clear...</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and allergies</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling really soft.</li>
            <li> My 1st time trying a facial sponge like this, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to..</li>
            <li> This product surprised me.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate the extra effort made by the seller.</li>
            <li> I soaked it in water as directed, then gently scrubbed my entire face in a circular motion.</li>
            <li> I think this Konjac sponge would work wonders for most people with normal to small occasional blemishes.</li>
            <li> It becomes really soft and spongy after its soaked.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice any change in my skin/complexion, but will continue to use the sponge - if nothing else, for the psychological benefits.</li>
            <li> was so surprised how it made my face feel</li>
            <li> No really go buy this right now.  </li>
            <li> I personally like to use this with my face wash, just to lightly scrub away the dead skin cells every morning.</li>
            <li> I love this little sponge, it gets into the hard to get to crevices like around the nose but does its cleaning gently.</li>
            <li> I never would have believed that this hard lump would leave my skin feeling smooth, hydrated and silky without trying.</li>
            <li> My skin gets rough fast and my nose is prone to blackheads.</li>
            <li> and and it is refreshing to see a company that stands behind their products and their customers.  </li>
            <li> When it is wet it gets very soft and pliable and feels like it has a natural oil that comes from it almost.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t  worth the price because the sponge practically desolves after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed that the item didn&#x27;t come with any detailed instruction, and honestly didn&#x27;t spend the time to research it.  </li>
            <li> Wet is a very soft sponge for exfoliating 3)</li>
            <li> It feels so good on my face and much less expensive than other face sponges/scrubbers</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and have noticed a marked difference in the rate at which my dark spots are fading.</li>
            <li> Its really just a small sponge on a string.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it four stars is because it take a long time for it to completely dry before your next use.  </li>
            <li> When it dries, it does get pretty hard, but it softens back up once you get it wet again.</li>
            <li> So far it has lasted, although it is a little frayed on one side.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take long for it to begin to dry up and the texture of the sponge changes.</li>
            <li> I used it with aveeno face wash, it was fully dry between uses and</li>
            <li> it up to dry</li>
            <li> I have not been using any cleanser with it and just using this after I cleanse to finish off before I dry my face.</li>
            <li> I then hang it to dry for the day.</li>
            <li> when dry, just put it in water a couple of minutes before use.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used it with a few different facial cleansers.</li>
            <li> I had to go online to figure out how to use it, because when it is dry it would be very exfoliating which confused me on how to use it-</li>
            <li> I wet it as per the directions.</li>
            <li> it looks like it would rough up your skin, but in actuality it softens it.</li>
            <li> It almost doesn&#x27;t make sense since it&#x27;s really not that abrasive at all.</li>
            <li> however as soon as it gets wet it does soften up.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not really</li>
            <li> For me personally, I do think the sponge is a little too small and would like to see it about 50% larger.  </li>
            <li> I prefer using it without soap, because I&#x27;m lazy and don&#x27;t want to sit and squeeze it until there&#x27;s no soap left on the sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hang</li>
            <li> I usually use this at night on days when I haven&#x27;t worn makeup, and occasionally in the morning/afternoon when I want to apply makeup or products, and it&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve washed</li>
            <li> You just wet it and rub on your face!</li>
            <li> one other thing I like to do is boil water once a week, and then let it sit in there for 2 min to kill off any bacteria that might be forming.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any improvements other than my skin</li>
            <li> It looks like a lump of pumice, in its dry state, but softens dramatically after soaking for a few moments as directed.</li>
            <li> Cold water will work too, but more slowly.</li>
            <li> This come in such a hard form..but softens up with water..</li>
            <li> Not worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> These days customer service seems to be going down hill</li>
            <li> dont waste your money, it is not worth $2.00 let alone $10.00, it does nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li> In its dry state it is hard and abrasive 2)</li>
            <li> Was a little hesitant to use.  </li>
            <li> I have been using a bamboo charcoal konjac sponge for a few months now and bought this one as a replacement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also even used my facial cleansing cloths, after using this product, just to see if it was cleaning well &amp; not leaving a bunch of makeup &amp; stuff behind</li>
            <li> Way too small.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that with the dark color, I can&#x27;t see if it gets/becomes dirty or anything.</li>
            <li> I buy A LOT on amazon and write very few reviews</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, I&#x27;m not sure how it works, but it also dries nicely &amp; NO mold/mildew (even in the 100% humidity of Florida).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rock hard.  </li>
            <li> it is really hard</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!!!  </li>
            <li> I have no clue if I had done something wrong?</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, it is summer in AZ, and my workout routine in addition to the heat causes my skin to flare up in the summer.</li>
            <li> Be wary that some may be defective</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> First time I used it I loved it. Gentle yet effective. Second time I used it wasn&#x27;t as good. It basically disintegrated. I have no clue if I had done something wrong? I used it with aveeno face wash, it was fully dry between uses and I wet it as per the directions. By the third time it was falling a part in the shower.  Update: much to my surprise after my review was up I received an email from the company stating that they are sending me a replacement. I have not gotten it yet and will update this review after using a new one but this speaks volumes about a company in my eyes. These days customer service seems to be going down hill and and it is refreshing to see a company that stands behind their products and their customers.  UPDATE: So I have received my replacement sponge in the mail a week or so ago and wanted to update again. This one is working great. The sponge gives the perfect amount of physical exfoliation and so far has kept its form. I use it in the morning instead of my clarasonic (use my clarasonic at night) now and my skin feels great. I really enjoy the shape of it as i am able to get rid of any flakey skin around my nose area. My skin tends to get red with the clarasonic so finding an alternative in the AM that did the job but didn&#x27;t make my skin too mad is wonderful.  I would definitely recommend the product but more so the company.  I buy A LOT on amazon and write very few reviews but this company has been a standout.   LAST UPDATE: this sponge works great. I have been using it for well over a month and it has been holding up great!</li>
            <li> This product is very interesting.  Was a little hesitant to use.  I was pleasant surprised with how well it cleaned and how great my skin felt. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I needed this for the exfoliation. My skin gets rough fast and my nose is prone to blackheads. I used it as soon as it came. Now, I love it for the exfoliation effect and the way it makes my blackheads on my nose disappear. I rarely get pimples but I have a feeling I will see fewer of those as well. I have needed something like this for a long time but just couldn&#x27;t find the right something. I have sensitive skin and allergies so I don&#x27;t do well with anything that isn&#x27;t fragrance free.  This is a bigger size than I had before.  My skin is looking healthier day by day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I love this sponge it is amazing wish I would have bought more</li>
            <li> Wonderful cleaning sponge! I had never used anything like this before, but It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying something like this.  After putting in water it gets soft and works great on your face.  My face felt really clean and soft afterwards.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Nice for exfoliating, and it rinses clean easily!</li>
            <li> Love this sponge, It leave my face very soft. I use it with my cleanser.</li>
            <li> Love the way it cleans my skin. Great product.</li>
            <li> Super nice in the shower. Love it</li>
            <li> I love this little sponge, it gets into the hard to get to crevices like around the nose but does its cleaning gently.</li>
            <li> I just received this yesterday and used last night, and again this morning. How did I live without this? It looks like a lump of pumice, in its dry state, but softens dramatically after soaking for a few moments as directed. Last night, I used this, without cleanser, to clean my face of a light application of mineral powder foundation...it left my pores free of any residue and my skin actually felt soft and silky afterwards. Appearances can be very deceiving...it looks like it would rough up your skin, but in actuality it softens it. I don&#x27;t know the chemistry of how this works, but all I care about is that it really works, and well. Looking forward to ridding my bathroom clutter of bottles of cleansers and lotions and replacing them with this one deceptively simple and effective little thing. Very excited to recommend this.</li>
            <li> Very soft and really does a nice job at exfoliation and invigoration</li>
            <li> Interesting product - never owned anything like this.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!!!  The second day I used this, I saw improvement to my Acne.  I am buying several more!!!</li>
            <li> I love this, leaves skin feeling great!</li>
            <li> This Konjac sponge works amazing with my skin! Its my first time using a konjac sponge and I am impressed. I use my sponge with my facial cleanser and it gives me the clean I am looking for. I like how it makes my skin feels super smooth. I am definitely going to be getting another sponge soon.</li>
            <li> Comfortable stuff! Really love it!</li>
            <li> I am loving this product. I use it every time I was my face and it is really helping my skin.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t come with any instructions on how to use it.  It&#x27;s rock hard.  How do I use this on my face?  or do I use it on my face?</li>
            <li> makes my face so smooth</li>
            <li> I love this.  It feels so good on my face and much less expensive than other face sponges/scrubbers and I love the Konjac Sponge.I read in &amp;#34;Better Homes and Gardens&amp;#34; August issue on page 24 about either YOUR product or one like it.  It was a great review and advertisement.  You should look it up</li>
            <li> easy to use with/ without soap when your cleaning your face</li>
            <li> I never would have believed that this hard lump would leave my skin feeling smooth, hydrated and silky without trying. After soaking as instructed it became so very soft and felt Great on my face and neck. Now that I have used it I will not go back to a cloth. This sponge cleans, soothes and moisturizers. All in just one step. I have not even used my night cream after using the Konjac sponge. Will definitely  keep using.</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t taken it on travel, I think it will be useful as such. I tried it at home and thought it served it&#x27;s purpose, but wasn&#x27;t wowed in terms of getting my face really clean. I do own a facial brush that does a good job of cleaning my face, but in a pinch this will do and it&#x27;s nice that it will decompose and does not have a big environmental impact.</li>
            <li> Really like it. Leaves my skin feeling really soft. Also tried it without using soap as suggested and received that same results.</li>
            <li> My 1st time trying a facial sponge like this, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to.. but I really like it!&lt;br /&gt;I will repurchase this</li>
            <li> This sponge does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, which is wash my face gently. This won&#x27;t exfoliate (unless you use it with a face scrub, which I wouldn&#x27;t as it might damage the sponge&#x27;s fibers) or remove makeup (unless you use it with a cleanser), but it will leave you with a clean face that isn&#x27;t stripped or raw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do have to soak it in warm water for awhile before you use it. You can hold it under running water or, to save water, stick it in a container filled with water. Cold water will work too, but more slowly. Then just gently squeeze the excess water out, and massage your face with the sponge! I&#x27;ve used this both with and without a cleanser, and both ways work fine. I prefer using it without soap, because I&#x27;m lazy and don&#x27;t want to sit and squeeze it until there&#x27;s no soap left on the sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hang it up to dry (there&#x27;s a little string on the sponge, which is convenient and I love) and you&#x27;re good to go! I usually use this at night on days when I haven&#x27;t worn makeup, and occasionally in the morning/afternoon when I want to apply makeup or products, and it&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve washed my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for a review, but these are my honest opinions on the product.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this konjac sponge. It&#x27;s quite big and can be used to on your body and/or face. When used on your face a konjac sponge is the most gentle, yet effective exfoliator I have ever used. I&#x27;ll always use one in my skincare routine now.</li>
            <li> This product surprised me. It is no ordinary sponge. My skin looked clearer, smoother and softer after the first use. Update: This product isn&#x27;t  worth the price because the sponge practically desolves after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> Received this in the mail pretty quickly along with an email explaining how to use it. Just emerge in water for about a minute and then gently use to exfoliate the face. It really does make your face feel really soft. It doesn&#x27;t take long for it to begin to dry up and the texture of the sponge changes. That&#x27;s when I stop. I can&#x27;t attribute to its success with anything else because I haven&#x27;t used it for very long but for the price it&#x27;s a nice product to have. The only reason I gave it four stars is because it take a long time for it to completely dry before your next use.  Update: I wanted to write further about the buying process because I&#x27;ve been really impressed. I got an email when I got the sponge explaining how to use it. A few days later I got another email from the distributor making sure the product was still satisfying me. They also included some frequently asked questions about the sponge that were really helpful! Such as describing how to clean the sponge and if it&#x27;s safe for ezcema.  I really appreciate the extra effort made by the seller.</li>
            <li> Wow!! I&#x27;ve been wanting to get one of these for a long time, as I&#x27;ve always heard great things about them. So glad I tried it! I soaked it in water as directed, then gently scrubbed my entire face in a circular motion. It feels very very mildly abrasive. It also feels very soothing and relaxing. It definitely has a unique texture. When I was done I was very impressed with how smooth my face was. It almost doesn&#x27;t make sense since it&#x27;s really not that abrasive at all. When my face dried it was so smooth, glowing,  and even felt moisturized somehow! Yea...I don&#x27;t want to be without one of these ever again. I&#x27;m already hooked!</li>
            <li> I think this Konjac sponge would work wonders for most people with normal to small occasional blemishes. I love that it is natural bamboo, and the string to keep track of it in the shower (which also helps in allowing it to dry correctly). Unfortunately for me, it is summer in AZ, and my workout routine in addition to the heat causes my skin to flare up in the summer. I had hopes that this product would help me keep blemish free, but it wasn&#x27;t enough by itself, or even adding my normal cleanser (which works for me in the summer using other means). One drawback for me was how the sponge arrived- just in shrink wrap. There were no instructions, and no &#x27;pretty&#x27; or appealing packaging at all. It just showed up in a box shrink wrapped. I had to go online to figure out how to use it, because when it is dry it would be very exfoliating which confused me on how to use it- however as soon as it gets wet it does soften up.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li> I received this at a discount for my honest opinion. I really liked this sponge. Had never used one before but it is very straight forward. You just wet it and rub on your face! When it is wet it gets very soft and pliable and feels like it has a natural oil that comes from it almost. It really smoothed out my skin with just a few uses and its so easy to use that there is no reason not to add it to my morning routine. I have not been using any cleanser with it and just using this after I cleanse to finish off before I dry my face.</li>
            <li> Love this - my face feels great!</li>
            <li> I have been using a bamboo charcoal konjac sponge for a few months now and bought this one as a replacement. It works just as well as my original sponge! This is my go to facial cleansing product. I use my acne facial wash with this and it keeps my problem skin in check</li>
            <li> I love this sponge! It&#x27;s perfect for creating a foamy lather with any face wash. I love that it exfoliates my skin without it feeling rough like some scrubs can. It&#x27;s super gentle and perfect for sensitive skin. I have acne prone skin and have noticed a marked difference in the rate at which my dark spots are fading. Will definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li> I love this little sponge. I use it with and without soap and either way my face feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> dont waste your money, it is not worth $2.00 let alone $10.00, it does nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li> I received this product free in exchange for my honest opinions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little scrubby is fun and easy to use. It comes in a scratchy, pumace like state when it arrives, and needs to be soaked or ran under warm water for about a min or two before using. It becomes really soft and spongy after its soaked. I personally like to use this with my face wash, just to lightly scrub away the dead skin cells every morning. I noticed my face felt softer and a had a nicer glow to it after using. I always rinse my scrub after using it, to get the soap residue off, by running it under warm water and lightly squishing it between my two hands until most of the water runs out. I then hang it to dry for the day. (It has a string attached) one other thing I like to do is boil water once a week, and then let it sit in there for 2 min to kill off any bacteria that might be forming. So far it has lasted, although it is a little frayed on one side.</li>
            <li> I adore this sponge. My face feels softer and smoother with every use. I wish it were a bit more durable, but it is a sponge.</li>
            <li> Great cleaning tool for face with just the right abrasion.  Gentle but effective.</li>
            <li> I was definitely excited to try this... have it hanging just outside the shower for daily use.  I was a little disappointed that the item didn&#x27;t come with any detailed instruction, and honestly didn&#x27;t spend the time to research it.  For me personally, I do think the sponge is a little too small and would like to see it about 50% larger.  I don&#x27;t really notice any change in my skin/complexion, but will continue to use the sponge - if nothing else, for the psychological benefits.</li>
            <li> i will never be without a kojac sponge again.  they are so great!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this Charcoal Konjac Sponge for my wife as she is always looking for beauty aids to help keep her facial skin feeling soft and clean. She absolutely loves how soft and moisturized her face feels now! Who knew something so simple can be so effective! I used it too and also felt the positive effects of this Konjac Sponge. Both my wife and I highly recommend this sponge!</li>
            <li> I had never tried one of these sponges before. I have to say I am very pleased with my purchase. It&#x27;s gentle on my skin and it removes all of my make up fairly easily. I don&#x27;t have to add cleanser to the sponge and the results are great.  I will continue to use and purchase this sponge for my nightly face cleansing routine .</li>
            <li> This provides the perfect exfoliation to my favorite skin care soap that I already use. When first using the product I saw no signs of the charcoal, but I really didn&#x27;t purchase this item for that. I use this item daily and will be purchasing another. The funniest comment was when my boyfriend asked why I had a rock hanging in the shower on a string. :-D</li>
            <li> This practically disintegrated into nothing after 1 use. Not worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This feels so nice on my face, like a massage!!</li>
            <li> 1) In its dry state it is hard and abrasive 2) Wet is a very soft sponge for exfoliating 3) Can be used with any cleanser  It makes my skin glow after I use it in the shower.  Edit: I just opened my second sponge from the company and it split open after my second use. Made a huge mess. Be wary that some may be defective</li>
            <li> Use as directed for great results , smoother skinand small wrinkles are disappearing!  I absolutely love it. Gentle and effective !</li>
            <li> Works fantastic love it</li>
            <li> Love this sponge, it leave your face very soft and you can use it even without saop, since it is made of a100% natural root, its natural components are good enough to clean, exfolite and soft your skin by itself, but you also can use with your favorite saop or cleanser. it is really hard when dry, just put it in water a couple of minutes before use.</li>
            <li> Buy this.  No really go buy this right now.  It is AMAZING.  My skin feels fantastic, yours should too.</li>
            <li> This is awesome -- love the way my face feels after using it every day.</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my face feel. I was a little hesitant to use it because it felt so hard, but once it&#x27;s wet, it&#x27;s perfect. Glad I finally got up the courage to try it :)</li>
            <li> I like this sponge, however I think the price is high for what you&#x27;re getting. Its really just a small sponge on a string. I haven&#x27;t seen any improvements other than my skin is getting a gentle exfoliation when I use it. Not a must have for me.</li>
            <li> It was good for the first couple of uses but it fell apart after about 10 days.</li>
            <li> I had no expectations for a konjac sponge to work, you do not need to add anuthing and it does remove all your makeup, and dead skin, leaving you with a soft and clean face, very good size and perfect for night or day</li>
            <li> This come in such a hard form..but softens up with water..was so surprised how it made my face feel..seem to smooth everything out and made my skin feel so glowing and fresh ..nice product.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Keep in fridge will last longer</li>
            <li> I like the sponge, but I can&#x27;t see any difference in my skin</li>
            <li> Way too small.  Its about the size of 2 1/2 fingers.</li>
            <li> Perfect size, not too harsh. Will gladly purchase again</li>
            <li> This little sponge is awesome!  It takes awhile for the water to soak in to soften it but once it has, it&#x27;s micro-exfoliant properties are great!  I&#x27;ve been using it for a week in conjunction with a great cleaner and I can tell a difference in my blackheads already.  I will definitely be ordering another or two or three as gifts and a spare!</li>
            <li> Okay, so I don&#x27;t even know where to start with this fantastic product, but here goes: I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product at first,  but I&#x27;m so glad that I tried it!  I&#x27;ve used it with just water (no cleanser) and I&#x27;ve used it with a few different facial cleansers. Even on its own (with just water to soften it), it really feels like it cleans my face &amp; is gentle enough not to cause irritation, redness, etc...but it also does feel like it&#x27;s gently exfoliating my skin. Kind of hard to explain, but it just feels good &amp; it works! When I use it with a facial cleanser, it works just as well &amp; it rinses out very easily. I&#x27;ve also even used my facial cleansing cloths, after using this product, just to see if it was cleaning well &amp; not leaving a bunch of makeup &amp; stuff behind AND I was very pleased!!! It cleaned my face so well, nothing was left behind!&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I&#x27;m not sure how it works, but it also dries nicely &amp; NO mold/mildew (even in the 100% humidity of Florida). When it dries, it does get pretty hard, but it softens back up once you get it wet again. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that with the dark color, I can&#x27;t see if it gets/becomes dirty or anything. However, I rinse it out thoroughly after every use &amp; the water runs clear...so I&#x27;m not really concerned.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I found this product &amp; I would/will highly recommend it to anyone/everyone!!&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU!!</li>
