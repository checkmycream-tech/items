            <li>And they&#x27;re sugar free and still taste good.</li>
            <li>but you won&#x27;t want to - the flavor is too good to finish quickly</li>

            <li>Sugar free pastilles taste gr eat..excellent for raspy throat..</li>
            <li>These are great for irritated throats, however I recommend finding a US supplier as it took a long time to receive them from this supplier.</li>
            <li>First time buying the sugar free</li>
            <li>and I do enjoy them, not as much as the full sugared ones.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and easy.</li>
            <li>I bought a huge box of these to share with the chorus I&#x27;m managing, and many of them were very thankful, saying that these \\&quot;magic pills\\&quot; had saved their voices after a long week of rehearsals and a full weekend of performances.</li>
            <li>But this is the first time I found blueberry and sugarfree!  </li>
            <li>My last order from Amazon was at a great price and came directly from Switzerland.</li>
            <li>Try them, you&#x27;ll be surprised and pleased.</li>

            <li>These were highly recommended by his surgeon to soothe his throat before and after a show!  </li>
            <li>A real added bonus.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Jessie</li>
            <li>Calms my coughing and soothes my throat better than any other.</li>
            <li>They are very pricey for what they are and I would like it better if they sold for less.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without them!</li>
            <li>...and the Sugarless Black Currant are my favorite flavor.  </li>
            <li>Fairly tasty;  they are supposed to help your throat, but I am not sure they do any more than hard candy for that.  </li>
            <li>High quality all around.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>This product helps keep the throat clear.</li>
            <li>Regular cough drops have menthol and don&#x27;t really coat your throat in the correct way.</li>
            <li>Very chewable and long lasting in that area, so you are not munching on lots of them.</li>
            <li>Expensive, but nice on the throat.</li>
            <li>Great flavour which lasts a long time, compared to other brands I have tried which seemed tasteless.  </li>

            <li> Great flavour which lasts a long time, compared to other brands I have tried which seemed tasteless.  </li>
            <li> I especially like that the large quantity box, 15 oz, is packaged with a small box to carry in your purse or briefcase</li>
            <li> The glycerin ingredient keeps your mouth and throat lubricated naturally, and the sugar-free aspect prevents that &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; feeling in the mouth you get with other lozenges.  </li>
            <li> It helps with my dry throat before I sing at church.</li>
            <li> so I consume an average of one per day, more when I&#x27;m sick or traveling, especially in air-conditioned environments.  </li>
            <li> Grether&#x27;s Sugarless Black Currant Pastilles were suggested by my  ENT to help sooth hoarseness.</li>
            <li> I swear by these lozenges and share them sparingly because some friends (and little ones) treat them like candy.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a strong flavor.</li>
            <li> I got used to these while living in NYC, but down in Texas, they are hard to find.</li>
            <li> Hard to describe what black currant tastes like,</li>
            <li> Recommended for any scratchy, tired, dry throat problems you may be experiencing.</li>
            <li> They are hard to find.  </li>
            <li> but they give me TERRIBLE breath and make me super self-conscious.</li>
            <li> Not ideal...</li>
            <li> These kept my throat at ease and didn&#x27;t cause weird side effects.</li>
            <li> you have a boring job and stand around for hours doing nothing, you&#x27;ll need these; however, they&#x27;re addictive and can break your budget.</li>
            <li> , they are expensive.  </li>
            <li> Grether&#x27;s pastilles are ferociously expensive...</li>
            <li> These were &amp;#34;prescribed&amp;#34; to me by the ENT (ears-nose-throat) specialist to the stars on Broadway during the worst sinus-infection I&#x27;d ever suffered.  </li>

            <li> These saved my musical theatre life. Playing a leading lady in a musical can be tricky. These kept my throat at ease and didn&#x27;t cause weird side effects. And they&#x27;re sugar free and still taste good. Recommended for any scratchy, tired, dry throat problems you may be experiencing. They&#x27;re a life saver!</li>
            <li> Delivered as advertised.  Fast and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Share one with a friend and they&#x27;ll keep looking back at you to see if you are going to offer another. I got used to these while living in NYC, but down in Texas, they are hard to find. In fact, I never see them here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a boring job and stand around for hours doing nothing, you&#x27;ll need these; however, they&#x27;re addictive and can break your budget. Such a nicer look over gum chewing any day.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite lozenges of all time.  They are soothing without burning and calming for all throat conditions: dryness, soreness, tickly coughs, and over-use. I use them are a travel staple. They are hard to find.  My last order from Amazon was at a great price and came directly from Switzerland.</li>
            <li> I love these! I am a singer and they are the perfect throat soother. Regular cough drops have menthol and don&#x27;t really coat your throat in the correct way.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these pastilles. They are very soothing. I keep them by my bedside.I enjoy the flavor and texture and I&#x27;m not having a sugar load.</li>
            <li> These pastilles have great flavor and I love having a way to moisten my mouth and throat without added sugar.</li>
            <li> Calms my coughing and soothes my throat better than any other. I carry them with me always.  Glad they are available sugar free.</li>
            <li> These are the best for sore throats and helping to stop coughing!</li>
            <li> Great flavour which lasts a long time, compared to other brands I have tried which seemed tasteless.  Very chewable and long lasting in that area, so you are not munching on lots of them.</li>
            <li> help a sore throat a lot</li>
            <li> I love these, and they really do work for my chronic dry mouth...but they give me TERRIBLE breath and make me super self-conscious. Not ideal...</li>

            <li> Great for singers, soothing</li>
            <li> A reasonably good substitute for Pine Brothers cough drops. Not as good as the real thing, but the best I&#x27;ve been able to find. I will definitely buy them again.</li>
            <li> Been using them for years, and It does what no other drop seems to be able to do, sooth the tickle in my throat. They are yummy!. First time buying the sugar free and I do enjoy them, not as much as the full sugared ones.</li>
            <li> I have bought these English throat soothers for years.  But this is the first time I found blueberry and sugarfree!  What a treat!  And the large tin contains a tiny tin thats perfect for going to plays or the opera and you don&#x27;t want to have something paper wrapped and noisy.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, they are expensive.  But I have not yet found anything comparable.  A lovely stocking stuffer for my girls, too.</li>
            <li> My fiancé is a singer and recently had throat surgery.  These were highly recommended by his surgeon to soothe his throat before and after a show!  He loves the taste and they def seem to help!</li>

            <li> I do a lot of public speaking and my throat can take a beating. I love these pastilles - like healthy gummy bears :-)</li>
            <li> Love this product. It helps with my dry throat before I sing at church. Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Finally a sugarless candy with no after taste and it tastes like there is sugar in it&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li> Fairly tasty;  they are supposed to help your throat, but I am not sure they do any more than hard candy for that.  They are very pricey for what they are and I would like it better if they sold for less.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but nice on the throat.</li>
            <li> This product helps keep the throat clear. Your cough is reduced and was recommended by my husband&#x27;s Doctor. Ships immediately!</li>
            <li> They are wonderful, but soooo expensive.  Please let me know when there is a deal on the price.  Thanks, Jessie</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without them!</li>
            <li> I bought a huge box of these to share with the chorus I&#x27;m managing, and many of them were very thankful, saying that these \\&quot;magic pills\\&quot; had saved their voices after a long week of rehearsals and a full weekend of performances. Hard to describe what black currant tastes like, but it&#x27;s not a strong flavor.</li>

These have the consistency of an extra-firm gummy-candy, you can chew them but you won&#x27;t want to - the flavor is too good to finish quickly I&#x27;m a jazz vocalist and arts manager who travels so I consume an average of one per day, more when I&#x27;m sick or traveling, especially in air-conditioned environments.  I swear by these lozenges and share them sparingly because some friends (and little ones) treat them like candy.  Buying the biggest tin is best value and comes with a pocket-sized box for convenience.</li>
