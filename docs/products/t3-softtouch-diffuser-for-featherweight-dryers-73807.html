            <li>This works well and is a great addition to my T3 hairdryer.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>This fit my T3 Featherweight dryer perfectly.</li>
            <li>I purchased a Featherweight T3 from QVC as their TSV and thought I loved it but missed my diffuser.  </li>
            <li>it does a good job with my curly hair.</li>
            <li>It fits my T3 Featherweight dryer nicely, and does a great job keeping my curls.  </li>
            <li>I love the T_3 dryer and the diffuser does a great job, but.......... it does not stay on unless I hold it upright.</li>
            <li>works great, and love the way it leaves my curls.</li>
            <li>With the T3 Journey Dryer I think the pair are actully better than the dryer I use at home!</li>
            <li>I think this would be great if it fit my blowdryer.</li>
            <li>I saw some reviews that stated that their piece didn&#x27;t fit their T3, but mine fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>It snaps onto the T3 perfectly and works really well.  </li>
            <li>great, glad I found this for my original featherweight dryer.  </li>
            <li>and this is by far the best combo.</li>
            <li>And, on top of that, had to pay to have it returned.</li>
            <li>the curls I am experiencing are phenomenal.  </li>
            <li>returning the diffuser today, and I will do more research before selecting the appropriate diffuser attachment.  </li>
            <li>My hair does so much better when I use it.</li>
            <li>Love the way it helps my hair curl.</li>
            <li>I will make sure there is a variety of diffusers to choose from.</li>
            <li>Love that they are light</li>
            <li>The attachment clips to the end of the hair dryer and rotates around easily.</li>
            <li>The product itself is better than the original one, but won&#x27;t work if doesnt&#x27; fit my dryer.</li>
            <li>It may be a fine diffuser, but the product info online led me to believe it would fit my dryer, which it does not.</li>
            <li>The diffuser was really huge and bulky.</li>
            <li>but there are 2 diffusers available, one for the featherweight and one for the featherweight\\&quot;2\\&quot; model.  </li>
            <li>Info inside the box says it s designed to fit Featherweight 2 and Featherweight Luxe 2i dryers.  </li>
            <li>From the Seller&#x27;s Description:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Fits all t3 Featherweight Dryers (excluding Featherweight 2 Dryers)&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the Box I received:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Specially designed to fit Featherweight 2 and Featherweight Luxe 2i dryers&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And from the reviews I read of how it doesn&#x27;t fit the Featherweight 2 and Luxe models, and the fact that the the seller said EXCLUDING Featherweight 2 dryers, I purchased it.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit my dryer even though it was suggested for me to buy them together.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>Turns out, it doesn&#x27;t fit mine</li>
            <li>I bought this one thinking it would fit and the material it&#x27;s made out of it</li>
            <li>No problem with fit, but teeth broke off both of them, making them unusable.</li>
            <li>I read all of the reviews for this one and got the impression that it would fit all of their hairdryers, so I ordered it.  </li>
            <li>Be sure you are getting the right one.</li>
            <li>Really recommend this diffuser!!!</li>
            <li>Item was received quickly and as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Totally home engineered but effective</li>
            <li>My hair wouldn&#x27;t turn out right without it.</li>
            <li>Wish there was a clearer way to verify what attachments are available for the particular model that I have.  </li>
            <li>Glad I bought this instead of buying a whole new hairdryer with diffuser.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Evidently they don&#x27;t make a diffuser for that dryer.  </li>
            <li>I think the new luxe 2i is even better then the old featherweight.</li>
            <li>She has long hair and it&#x27;s more like a mane.  </li>
            <li>only rated one star because it was very misleading when I purchased it as to exactly which dryer it would fit.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to scrunch my hair to much to get it to curl</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>so I really need a diffuser.  </li>
            <li>The fit is snug enough that I can leave the diffuser in the dryer while it is packed away.</li>
            <li>I sent it back and bought a disposable mesh sock that uses elastic to secure it to the end of the dryer.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I&#x27;ve ever had an issue when purchasing something using the \\&quot;Frequently Bought Together\\&quot; tool.  </li>
            <li>was specifically looking for a diffuser for the older model of the T3 Featherweight.</li>
            <li>I would like it better if it had soft, long &#x27;rubber&#x27; fingers like my old diffuser</li>
            <li>I guess I will need to be more careful in the future.</li>
            <li>Does get really hot, but just don&#x27;t touch it until it properly cools.</li>
            <li>WHICH I ORDERED AT THE SAME TIME, AS SUGGESTED BY THE LINE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HAIRDRYER DESCRIPTION - THE ONE ABOUT OTHERS PURCHASING SUGGESTED ITEMS TO GO ALONG WITH WHAT YOU ARE INTERESTED IN BUYING.  </li>
            <li>I have thin wavy hair, so it works great for me, and it does not look flat.</li>
            <li>I bought this diffuser to fit my new dryer, but it did not fit.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Frequently Bought Together\\&quot; with the T3 Featherweight Luxe 2i Ion Generator Hair Dryer.  </li>
            <li>Without it I would have completely frizzy hair</li>
            <li>Having trouble finding one that will fit.  </li>
            <li>After receiving the dryer I read it needed the soft touch 2 diffuser.</li>
            <li>Can anyone tell me if this diffuser would fit the small T3 Bespoke travel dryer that I bought from QVC a couple of years ago?  </li>
            <li>It is very difficult to find and I was happy it was on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I am afraid it is going to break, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>Generally these come with hair dryers as attachments but the T3 series does not provide one, hence had to order one separately.</li>
            <li>I bought one directly from T3 when I bought the hair dryer, and same thing happen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my dryer for several years and really missed the ability to dry my hair and keep it wavy.</li>
            <li>problem is that I use a diffuser differently than most people, because I have really long thick hair.</li>
            <li>(unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t fit the T3 Featherweight)to really lift at the roots.  </li>
            <li>it actually stops you from being able to get the air deeply into thicker hair, I am simply no good at operating a hair dryer and a brush simultaneously with my length of hair I have to keep putting the hair dryer down to get a new section of hair, I don&#x27;t have time for that stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> , dry my air in a shorter amount than other dryers, and they don&#x27;t break like other dryers, they last me an average of 3 years vrs cheap ones, that used to last me 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> Really needed the diffuser to get her hair dry and to get a little height to her style.  </li>
            <li> I like this one so much that I now use it and the dryer for my everyday use!  </li>
            <li> No static, drys really fast and</li>
            <li> This does not fit the new T3 Featherweight dryer.</li>
            <li> Contrary to their claim, the T3 SoftTouch Diffuser for Featherweight Dryers (#73807) does NOT fit my new T3 Featherweight</li>
            <li> Too bad because nice looking diffuser.</li>
            <li> This is not clear even on the manufacturers website.  </li>
            <li> They have different sizes that I was not aware of.</li>
            <li> Helps me dry my curls to perfection.</li>
            <li> , I have a lot of hair and takes a bit to dry it..</li>
            <li> I usually have to take out my old hair dryer and diffuser to add lift to my crown area, as this just doesn&#x27;t do the job.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care that it&#x27;s too loose anymore.</li>
            <li> Sold as a companion product with the T3 Featherweight Luxe 2i Ion Hair Dryer but did not fit the hair dryer that I bought at the same time.  </li>
            <li> ONLY PROBLEM WAS THAT THE DIFFUSER DID NOT FIT THAT DRYER!!!&lt;br /&gt;IN ADDITION,</li>
            <li> This was not how i expected the diffuser to be.</li>
            <li> it did not fit, so I had to send it back.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it fits on next model down from the Luxe but the box of the diffuser as well as the items advertisement is misleading.</li>
            <li> also don&#x27;t love the dryer, although I didn&#x27;t buy it at Amazon, it&#x27;s got stupid buttons instead of slides to turn it on and off</li>
            <li> Love the dryer, hate the diffuser.</li>
            <li> I got this to replace a ruined on that I previously had for a Conair drier, however it did not fit at all</li>
            <li> I use the &#x27;fingers&#x27; to brush my hair and look for a smooth result, with this stupid plastic rim around the edge</li>
            <li> Some reviewers say it does not fit</li>
            <li> This did not fit my T3 dryer.  </li>
            <li> This T3 diffuser model #73807 does not fit the T3 Featherweight Journey travel hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> It did not fit</li>
            <li> This diffuser does not fit my hair dryer.  </li>

            <li> This does not fit the new T3 Featherweight dryer. And, on top of that, had to pay to have it returned. Ugh.</li>
            <li> This fit my T3 Featherweight dryer perfectly. Helps me dry my curls to perfection.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Featherweight T3 from QVC as their TSV and thought I loved it but missed my diffuser.  I bought this and it just fits perfectly and the curls I am experiencing are phenomenal.  Some reviewers say it does not fit but there are 2 diffusers available, one for the featherweight and one for the featherweight\\&quot;2\\&quot; model.  Be sure you are getting the right one.</li>
            <li> This did not fit my T3 dryer.  Wish there was a clearer way to verify what attachments are available for the particular model that I have.  This is not clear even on the manufacturers website.  For those of us who received a T3 as a gift, pictorials would help.</li>
            <li> I love the T_3 dryer and the diffuser does a great job, but.......... it does not stay on unless I hold it upright. It says it is for the model # dryer I have, but it falls off.</li>
            <li> As recommended by Amazon, I purchased this diffuser when I purchased the [[ASIN:B008N3HXTW T3 Featherweight Luxe 2i Ion Generator Hair Dryer]]. When purchasing the hair dryer, this item was (and as of 9/24/2013 is still) listed under \\&quot;Frequently Bought Together\\&quot; with the T3 Featherweight Luxe 2i Ion Generator Hair Dryer.  Contrary to their claim, the T3 SoftTouch Diffuser for Featherweight Dryers (#73807) does NOT fit my new T3 Featherweight Dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m returning the diffuser today, and I will do more research before selecting the appropriate diffuser attachment.  This was the first time I&#x27;ve ever had an issue when purchasing something using the \\&quot;Frequently Bought Together\\&quot; tool.  I guess I will need to be more careful in the future.</li>
            <li> This works well with my T3 hairdryer.  It gives my thin hair body.  I would recommend it.  My hair does so much better when I use it.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Perfect for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> it does a good job with my curly hair. I don&#x27;t have to scrunch my hair to much to get it to curl</li>
            <li> Fits my drier perfectly &amp; does the job just as it should! My hair wouldn&#x27;t turn out right without it. Without it I would have completely frizzy hair or if I just allowed my hair to air-dry then the curls would get pulled out from the weight of the water in my hair.</li>
            <li> Item was received quickly and as advertised.  I am very happy with my purchase. I have nothing else to say.</li>
            <li> It fits my T3 Featherweight perfectly. Love the way it helps my hair curl. I&#x27;ve had probably 8 different dryer/diffusers over the years and this is by far the best combo.</li>
            <li> It fits my T3 Featherweight dryer nicely, and does a great job keeping my curls.  I would like it better if it had soft, long &#x27;rubber&#x27; fingers like my old diffuser (unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t fit the T3 Featherweight)to really lift at the roots.  I usually have to take out my old hair dryer and diffuser to add lift to my crown area, as this just doesn&#x27;t do the job.  Otherwise,  no problems with shipping or delivery on this item.</li>
            <li> It says it fits all T3 hairdryers, but it does not!  I am trying to exchange it for one that fits.  The product itself is better than the original one, but won&#x27;t work if doesnt&#x27; fit my dryer.</li>
            <li> Can anyone tell me if this diffuser would fit the small T3 Bespoke travel dryer that I bought from QVC a couple of years ago?  Having trouble finding one that will fit.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife. She has the 83808 Bespoke Labs T3 Featherweight and it fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> This T3 diffuser model #73807 does not fit the T3 Featherweight Journey travel hairdryer.  Info inside the box says it s designed to fit Featherweight 2 and Featherweight Luxe 2i dryers.  It may be a fine diffuser, but the product info online led me to believe it would fit my dryer, which it does not.</li>
            <li> From the Seller&#x27;s Description:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Fits all t3 Featherweight Dryers (excluding Featherweight 2 Dryers)&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the Box I received:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Specially designed to fit Featherweight 2 and Featherweight Luxe 2i dryers&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was specifically looking for a diffuser for the older model of the T3 Featherweight. And from the reviews I read of how it doesn&#x27;t fit the Featherweight 2 and Luxe models, and the fact that the the seller said EXCLUDING Featherweight 2 dryers, I purchased it. Too bad I&#x27;ll be sending it back. This was a real disappointment. Another failed attempt to purchase beauty products and appliances on Amazon. &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> This was shown with the dryer I bought my daughter.  It did not fit and I believe was made for earlier&lt;br /&gt;T3 models.  I therefore, had to return it.</li>
            <li> I love the featherweight hair dryer, however this diffuser is terrible. I&#x27;ve gone thru 3 in a year. They  are so flimsy, fall off after 10 minutes of use, then off course land on tile and break either the circumference of what holds it in place or a tooth. All off them, same thing. I bought one directly from T3 when I bought the hair dryer, and same thing happen. Very flawed design. I have gone thru several T3 hairdryers because I do use them a lot, I have a lot of hair and takes a bit to dry it.. Love that they are light, dry my air in a shorter amount than other dryers, and they don&#x27;t break like other dryers, they last me an average of 3 years vrs cheap ones, that used to last me 3-4 months. Next dyer I have to buy I will make sure there is a variety of diffusers to choose from. I hate to keep wasting money buying diffusers so often.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my dryer even though it was suggested for me to buy them together.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed in this situation.</li>
            <li> Sold as a companion product with the T3 Featherweight Luxe 2i Ion Hair Dryer but did not fit the hair dryer that I bought at the same time.  No alternative was offered.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> only rated one star because it was very misleading when I purchased it as to exactly which dryer it would fit.  Turns out, it doesn&#x27;t fit mine and I could not return it.</li>
            <li> Gave this to our daughter for Christmas along with the hair dryer, or course, and she loves it.  She has long hair and it&#x27;s more like a mane.  Really needed the diffuser to get her hair dry and to get a little height to her style.  This is really a big help.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my T3 blowdryer. I&#x27;ve had my dryer for several years and really missed the ability to dry my hair and keep it wavy. I was so happy to find this here.</li>
            <li> Fits hairdryer does it suppose to do... Does get really hot, but just don&#x27;t touch it until it properly cools.</li>
            <li> I just received the T3 diffuser last week.  I attached it to the dryer and it fits perfectly!  The attachment clips to the end of the hair dryer and rotates around easily.</li>
            <li> I got this to replace a ruined on that I previously had for a Conair drier, however it did not fit at all so I returned it. The products need to come with a measurement for the point of attachment.</li>
            <li> I did my research and hence did not have the problem of this not fitting onto my hairdryer like some people did. I have the T3 Featherweight (not the 2).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problem is that I use a diffuser differently than most people, because I have really long thick hair. I use the &#x27;fingers&#x27; to brush my hair and look for a smooth result, with this stupid plastic rim around the edge it actually stops you from being able to get the air deeply into thicker hair, I am simply no good at operating a hair dryer and a brush simultaneously with my length of hair I have to keep putting the hair dryer down to get a new section of hair, I don&#x27;t have time for that stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t love the dryer, although I didn&#x27;t buy it at Amazon, it&#x27;s got stupid buttons instead of slides to turn it on and off and I keep shutting it off while I&#x27;m drying my hair and changing hand position!</li>
            <li> I saw some reviews that stated that their piece didn&#x27;t fit their T3, but mine fit perfectly. Its a great diffuser and I&#x27;m quite happy with it.</li>
            <li> when I attached this to my blow dryer, it was very difficult to remove.  When I took it off, it pulled off the protective ring around the dryer&#x27;s mouth where the thing attaches.</li>
            <li> I ORDERED THIS DIFFUSER TO GO ALONG WITH THE T3 ION GENERATOR HAIR DRYER (FEATHERWEIGHT LUXE 2i) WHICH I ORDERED AT THE SAME TIME, AS SUGGESTED BY THE LINE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HAIRDRYER DESCRIPTION - THE ONE ABOUT OTHERS PURCHASING SUGGESTED ITEMS TO GO ALONG WITH WHAT YOU ARE INTERESTED IN BUYING.  GREAT I THOUGHT.  ONLY PROBLEM WAS THAT THE DIFFUSER DID NOT FIT THAT DRYER!!!&lt;br /&gt;IN ADDITION, THE SUPPLIER TO AMAZON WAS NOT AN AUTHORIZED DEALER OF T3 PRODUCTS!!&lt;br /&gt;BUT AMAZON IS A FIRST-RATE BUSINESS &amp; WHEN I EXPLAINED THE PROBLEM THEY EVENPAID FOR THE SHIPPING COSTS TO RETURN THE ITEM.&lt;br /&gt;WELL DONE AMAZON!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on the T3 Featherweight Journey Travel Dryer.  It snaps onto the T3 perfectly and works really well.  I have curly hair so I really need a diffuser.  With the T3 Journey Dryer I think the pair are actully better than the dryer I use at home!</li>
            <li> Was looking for a diffuser that would work on my traveling dryer.  I like this one so much that I now use it and the dryer for my everyday use!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have a model 83808 T3 hair dryer.  This diffuser does not fit my hair dryer.  Am returning the diffuser.</li>
            <li> This is great. It fits my hairdryer perfectly.</li>
            <li> If you have a T3 feather weight luxe dyer this will not fit. this diffuser was recommended  to go with the dryer.  After receiving the dryer I read it needed the soft touch 2 diffuser.</li>
            <li> I purchased the T3 Featherweight Luxe Hair Dryer and it was suggested that I also purchase the diffuser along with it which I did.  Although the box of the diffuser says &#x27;for T3 Hair Dryers&#x27; this diffuser does not fit, not even close! Not sure if it fits on next model down from the Luxe but the box of the diffuser as well as the items advertisement is misleading.</li>
            <li> The diameter of the opening to go over your hair dryer is 2&amp;#34;.  This fits my t3 hairdryer perfectly and it works great!</li>
            <li> Difficult to put on and take off dryer.  I am afraid it is going to break, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> This was not the model I needed even after providing the model number of my T3 dryer.</li>
            <li> Works great.  This diffuser fits onto my T3 no problem and works great. Glad I bought this instead of buying a whole new hairdryer with diffuser.</li>
            <li> great, glad I found this for my original featherweight dryer.  It is very difficult to find and I was happy it was on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought this diffuser to fit my new dryer, but it did not fit. They have different sizes that I was not aware of.</li>
            <li> I bought the T3 blow dryer at sephora and needed a diffuser. The ones I had were too big. I bought this one thinking it would fit and the material it&#x27;s made out of it looks fancy. Turns out it&#x27;s too big as well, but I tried it anyway and it&#x27;s amazing! No static, drys really fast and my curls are great! I don&#x27;t care that it&#x27;s too loose anymore. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Does not fit T3 Featherweight 2 (model # 73821).  Could not attach because diffuser was too big to attach to the hair dryer.  Too bad because nice looking diffuser.</li>
            <li> Really recommend this diffuser!!! works great, and love the way it leaves my curls. I have thin wavy hair, so it works great for me, and it does not look flat.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly and fits as it should</li>
            <li> I think this would be great if it fit my blowdryer. I wish it was universal. I think the new luxe 2i is even better then the old featherweight. This attachment just isn&#x27;t for it</li>
            <li> I have purchased two of these for my T3 dryer. No problem with fit, but teeth broke off both of them, making them unusable. Pretty annoying, especially considering how expensive they are compared to other diffusers. Love the dryer, hate the diffuser.</li>
            <li> Does NOT fit the T3 Featherweight Luxe 2i dryer. Will be returning.</li>
            <li> This was not how i expected the diffuser to be. Generally these come with hair dryers as attachments but the T3 series does not provide one, hence had to order one separately. The diffuser was really huge and bulky. Planning on returning it.</li>
            <li> Fits my T-3 Featherweight Journey travel hairdryer perfectly! The fit is snug enough that I can leave the diffuser in the dryer while it is packed away.</li>
            <li> Note to self:  Do not buy a hair dryer if a diffuser is not included in the package.  Even though the description on the website explicitly states that this diffuser is made for the hair dryer I bought, that was not the case.  Evidently they don&#x27;t make a diffuser for that dryer.  I ended up returning the dryer to my local retailer. Argh!</li>
            <li> The description reads &amp;#34;Fits all t3 Featherweight Dryers (excluding Featherweight 2 Dryers)&amp;#34; when in actuality, the item that is shipped fits ONLY Featherweight 2 Dryers according to packaging information.</li>
            <li> The diffuser does not fit the hairdryer for which it was made. I sent it back and bought a disposable mesh sock that uses elastic to secure it to the end of the dryer. Totally home engineered but effective</li>
            <li> This works well and is a great addition to my T3 hairdryer.</li>
            <li> I emailed the company who makes the T3 hairdryer and asked which diffuser fits it.  NO answer!  I read all of the reviews for this one and got the impression that it would fit all of their hairdryers, so I ordered it.  it did not fit, so I had to send it back.  Very disappointed.  Amazon is the BEST.  They refunded my money even though the box was ripped.</li>
