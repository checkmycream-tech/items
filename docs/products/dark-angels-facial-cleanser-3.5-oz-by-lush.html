            <li>Great product, smells wonderful and leaves my face soft and clear.</li>
            <li>After a week, it was even better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is not a cleanser I&#x27;d recommend for daily use as it is too abrasive (it has sugar in it), but twice a week is perfect.</li>

            <li>and I can go out with no makeup at all and feel fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;What rinsed off perfectly before now leaves a greasy, black coating on my face that takes a bit of elbow grease to remove.</li>
            <li>Although I am not a black licorice fan, the smell of this is wonderfully pleasant.</li>
            <li>/&gt; - You not only get a great product</li>
            <li>After two weeks, my skin was clear and I felt good about my appearance again.</li>
            <li>Feels so good to use a natural product.</li>
            <li>My skin seems clean, but felt sorta itchy.</li>
            <li>This product has the ability to clean my skin without that drying feeling.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing when it works, but I&#x27;m not going to waste time and money looking for a good batch.</li>

            <li>Thanks, Lush, for not only making great products and staying true to your morals, but for helping me feel better about my body!</li>
            <li>I loved,  it really works and let your skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Works great when I really need a deep cleaan for my face</li>
            <li>but you also support a great cause because Lush is cruelty free and are big time supporters of getting rid of animal testing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even if you don&#x27;t have acne, you&#x27;ll love it because it gets your skin so clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Even if you don&#x27;t have acne, you&#x27;ll love it because it gets your skin so clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin with dry patches on my nose and cheeks, and this is a wonderful exfoliating facial cleanser for maintaining my skin.</li>
            <li>I had heard a few people having experienced &#x27;5-o-clock shadow&#x27; when using this product but disregarded it.</li>
            <li>Maybe it smells better when you buy from Lush?</li>
            <li>It leaves my oily skin feeling fresh and matte.</li>
            <li>Honestly I&#x27;ve had the same container since 2010, had to add water to it but works well</li>
            <li>It is the best thing that&#x27;s ever happened to my skin!s like a black, gritty paste.</li>
            <li>Not only does it do what Lush claims (which is calming redness and irritation and making skin smooth, soft, and bright)</li>
            <li>I love that Lush&#x27;s products are handmade, all natural and fresh.</li>
            <li>- Very course for some serious exfoliation (probably not the best for sensitive</li>
            <li>Dark Angels have made my skin soft, glowing and does an AMAZING job with exfoliation!</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin so soft and clean.</li>
            <li>This is seriously the best facial product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It was $30 for a small jar but after reading all the great reviews on Lush&#x27;s website, I took a chance and ordered</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this.</li>
            <li>With much regret, I&#x27;m changing my 5 star rating to a 1.</li>
            <li>I am quickly falling in love with Lush products, and Dark Angels is no exception.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite cleanser/exfoliator, it takes away my excess oil without drying out which i really have not ever felt with any other oily skin cleanser.</li>
            <li>I normally only use it on my face since it&#x27;s kind of pricey, but lately I&#x27;ve started applying it on a few body scars because of the great results I was seeing.</li>
            <li>I suffer from mild acne, especially during that time of the month, and it helps to keep things under control when I start to break out.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel clean but it leaves my skin grey.</li>
            <li>I do however really like the Ocean Salt Scrub by Lush.</li>
            <li>When I returned it to the Lush store, the sales clerk admitted that they can get as many bad batches as they do good batches.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the exact same product.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve also found that it has significantly lightened my acne scars after only two weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li>All natural!</li>
            <li>Even though the jar is small, it will last a good two months if you don&#x27;t grab big goops of it.</li>
            <li>Even though the jar is small, it will last a good two months if you don&#x27;t grab big goops of it.</li>
            <li>I first tried Lush&#x27;s BIG Sea Salt Shampoo and loved it, so I looked at their other products and saw this Dark Angels facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>Helps  me maintain a clear complexion</li>
            <li>BUT, buying from the lush website is way cheaper than Amazon.</li>
            <li>I do this every day and my acne has disappeared completely.</li>
            <li>You only need a pinch to wash your whole face.</li>
            <li>You only need a pinch to wash your whole face.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so so soft.</li>
            <li>I brought this directly from the lush website twice as cheaper than Amazon price.</li>
            <li>fortunately isn&#x27;t far</li>
            <li>Was a bit hesitant to purchase this product because of the name but was pleasantly surprised by the results.</li>
            <li>All natural and all organic.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and buy this directly from Lush.  </li>
            <li>My first photo shows my nose strip result right before using Dark Angels and my second photo</li>
            <li>This possibly will stain your tub/sink, but using a scrubbing cleaner such as Comet will take it right</li>
            <li>Gross feeling, super coarse and super messy.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money unlike other things I have tried.</li>
            <li>I cannot recommend this product, because you really have no idea if you will get a good batch or a bad batch.</li>
            <li>When you add water to it, make sure it&#x27;s wet enough to look muddy before applying to reduce black residue.</li>
            <li>You just pinch off a small amount (a little goes a long way) and the gritty texture does a great job of exfoliating and it gets every last bit of dirt, oil and makeup off my face.</li>

            <li>This, along with Lush&#x27;s &#x27;Coalface&#x27;, is the only product that actually treats my acne.</li>
            <li>Lush always uses natural ingredients so you never have to worry about foreign chemicals.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this as it cleared up my face after about 2 weeks (using every other day).</li>

            <li> Tried mixing DA with more water, less water, hot water, and cold water to no avail.</li>
            <li> My skin does get greasier quick on a day/night I use this instead of my Angels on Bare Skin, but it is a small price to pay for the smoothing effects of this dark cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 4/29/2016</li>
            <li> I went into my local Lush and purchased (probably my 5th pot) of Dark Angels only to discover that my batch will not wash</li>
            <li> Lush&#x27;s Dark Angels is one of my holy grail items.</li>
            <li> Dark Angels is a gentle black sugar and charcoal scrub for oily skin.</li>
            <li> When I returned it to the Lush store, the sales clerk admitted that they can get as many bad batches as they do good batches.is bad, then I say go for it and try/use Dark Angels.</li>
            <li> it hard to find a product that makes my skin feel clean but without feeling dried out.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take too long to arrive either.</li>
            <li> After using this the first night, I woke up the next morning to a dramatic reduction in pimples.</li>
            <li> I purchased my Dark Angels directly from the manufacturer for less than thirteen dollars (plus six dollars shipping).</li>
            <li> I still get one or two small zits when that time of the month comes, which I attribute to hormones, but they are tiny compared to the huge cystic breakouts I used to get that were so big, red and painful.</li>
            <li> The only thing I haven&#x27;t tried was a prescription acne medicine, because I have no health insurance and can&#x27;t afford it, plus the side effects sound just as bad as the acne itself.</li>
            <li> Well, I am telling you personally consider that if and when you purchase Dark Angels even if you&#x27;ve used Dark Angels with no problems before.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and was using harsh chemicals on my face and using astringent daily.</li>
            <li> This facial cleanser cleans my face without leaving it dried out or oily at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a harsh smell...</li>
            <li> If you live near a Lush store and don&#x27;t mind returning the product if it is bad, then I say go for it and try/use Dark Angels.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I have to return my pot back to Lush wish</li>
            <li> face wash comes in a small jar and it looks like a black, gritty paste.</li>
            <li> At first, I was a little worried to use this on my face because it looks so weird</li>
            <li> and I wanted to try Dark Angels.</li>
            <li> Tried using some DA on my arms and chest and received the same result of black greasepaint that was hard to remove.</li>
            <li> Put all those chemical-laden acne products down and try this.</li>
            <li> Put all those chemical-laden acne products down and try this.</li>
            <li> Hands down.</li>
            <li> Only gripe is that the container is very small for the price...</li>
            <li> There were black specs all over my sink and face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed some of my acne marks seem to be less visible.</li>

            <li> I used herbalism for the longest time and I wanted to try Dark Angels. It makes me feel clean but it leaves my skin grey. It seriously is turning me grey! I don&#x27;t even want to use the rest of it.</li>
            <li> i love this product. BUT, buying from the lush website is way cheaper than Amazon.</li>
            <li> Works great when I really need a deep cleaan for my face</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this. But it smells like coals burning in a charcoal grill. It is also very messy. There were black specs all over my sink and face. My skin seems clean, but felt sorta itchy. It was like washing my face with dirt. I would avoid this one! I do however really like the Ocean Salt Scrub by Lush. It smells amazing..buy Ocean Salt instead...dark angels sucks!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cleanser/exfoliator, it takes away my excess oil without drying out which i really have not ever felt with any other oily skin cleanser. I wouldn&#x27;t call this a holy grail because it doesn&#x27;t magically fix my face but my oily blemish prone skin always reacts well to this product.</li>
            <li> This, along with Lush&#x27;s &#x27;Coalface&#x27;, is the only product that actually treats my acne. I use this as a mask. I apply this halfway through a shower after washing my face with Coalface and leave it on for 15 minutes then get back into the shower to wash it off (it&#x27;s very messy so using it for a shower works best.) I do this every day and my acne has disappeared completely. There&#x27;s only one problem:&lt;br /&gt;The store never seems to have this in stock! They can&#x27;t keep up with the demand. So I order from here sometimes and it&#x27;s the exact same product. Doesn&#x27;t take too long to arrive either.</li>
            <li> At first, I was a little worried to use this on my face because it looks so weird but I have to say that this is one of the best facial cleansers I&#x27;ve ever had. I have oily skin and was using harsh chemicals on my face and using astringent daily. This facial cleanser cleans my face without leaving it dried out or oily at the end of the day. I&#x27;m NEVER going back to regular face wash again.</li>
            <li> Lush&#x27;s Dark Angels is one of my holy grail items. I suffer from mild acne, especially during that time of the month, and it helps to keep things under control when I start to break out. Not only does it do what Lush claims (which is calming redness and irritation and making skin smooth, soft, and bright), I&#x27;ve also found that it has significantly lightened my acne scars after only two weeks of daily use. I normally only use it on my face since it&#x27;s kind of pricey, but lately I&#x27;ve started applying it on a few body scars because of the great results I was seeing. And yes, I&#x27;m starting to see improvements with those as well. Thanks, Lush, for not only making great products and staying true to your morals, but for helping me feel better about my body!</li>
            <li> Great product, smells wonderful and leaves my face soft and clear. Only gripe is that the container is very small for the price...</li>
            <li> This is a long review, but I&#x27;ve suffered for so long with such horrible acne that I feel like this stuff is a miracle. After getting through my teen years without a single breakout, at about age 24, I started getting terrible acne. I&#x27;ve been dealing with it for 6 years, and at times it has been so bad that I don&#x27;t want to leave the house out of embarrassment. I have even cried out of frustration. I have tried EVERYTHING, from ProActiv to every drugstore brand of acne wash to every home remedy, including apple cider vinegar and lemon juice and all kinds of creams and pastes. I even tried several types of birth control which my gyno said would help with the acne. Nothing worked. The only thing I haven&#x27;t tried was a prescription acne medicine, because I have no health insurance and can&#x27;t afford it, plus the side effects sound just as bad as the acne itself. I first tried Lush&#x27;s BIG Sea Salt Shampoo and loved it, so I looked at their other products and saw this Dark Angels facial cleanser. It was $30 for a small jar but after reading all the great reviews on Lush&#x27;s website, I took a chance and ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say unequivocally, that after 6 years of tears, frustration and embarrassment, that I found my holy grail. After using this the first night, I woke up the next morning to a dramatic reduction in pimples. After a week, it was even better. After two weeks, my skin was clear and I felt good about my appearance again. I still get one or two small zits when that time of the month comes, which I attribute to hormones, but they are tiny compared to the huge cystic breakouts I used to get that were so big, red and painful. I will never use anything else to wash my face ever again! I love that Lush&#x27;s products are handmade, all natural and fresh. They even come with a picture and the name of the person who made your product. The best part for me as an animal lover is that they are against animal testing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This face wash comes in a small jar and it looks like a black, gritty paste. You just pinch off a small amount (a little goes a long way) and the gritty texture does a great job of exfoliating and it gets every last bit of dirt, oil and makeup off my face. I use it almost every day. I no longer feel the need to wear heavy makeup to cover my acne and I can go out with no makeup at all and feel fine. I still have some scarring from the terrible acne, but even those are fading since I started using organic shea butter to moisturize. Even though the jar is small, it will last a good two months if you don&#x27;t grab big goops of it. You only need a pinch to wash your whole face. If you have bad skin like I did, you don&#x27;t have to suffer. Put all those chemical-laden acne products down and try this. I&#x27;ve recommended it to everyone I know. Even if you don&#x27;t have acne, you&#x27;ll love it because it gets your skin so clean and soft. It is the best thing that&#x27;s ever happened to my skin!s like a black, gritty paste.

            <li> This is seriously the best facial product I have ever used. Hands down. Leaves my skin so soft and clean. Makeup goes on flawlessly. Breakouts are gone. Buy it and you will NOT be disappointed!! Well worth the money unlike other things I have tried.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It makes my skin feel so so soft. Because I have oily skin it hard to find a product that makes my skin feel clean but without feeling dried out. This product has the ability to clean my skin without that drying feeling. I&#x27;ve also noticed some of my acne marks seem to be less visible. I brought this directly from the lush website twice as cheaper than Amazon price.</li>
            <li> Helps  me maintain a clear complexion</li>
            <li> I am quickly falling in love with Lush products, and Dark Angels is no exception. I have oily skin with dry patches on my nose and cheeks, and this is a wonderful exfoliating facial cleanser for maintaining my skin. Using this product is messy, I&#x27;m not going to lie. The results are amazing and worth the hassle/clean up required. This possibly will stain your tub/sink, but using a scrubbing cleaner such as Comet will take it right up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a cleanser I&#x27;d recommend for daily use as it is too abrasive (it has sugar in it), but twice a week is perfect. Although I am not a black licorice fan, the smell of this is wonderfully pleasant. My skin does get greasier quick on a day/night I use this instead of my Angels on Bare Skin, but it is a small price to pay for the smoothing effects of this dark cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 4/29/2016 With much regret, I&#x27;m changing my 5 star rating to a 1. I had heard a few people having experienced &#x27;5-o-clock shadow&#x27; when using this product but disregarded it. Well, I am telling you personally consider that if and when you purchase Dark Angels even if you&#x27;ve used Dark Angels with no problems before. I went into my local Lush and purchased (probably my 5th pot) of Dark Angels only to discover that my batch will not wash off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What rinsed off perfectly before now leaves a greasy, black coating on my face that takes a bit of elbow grease to remove. Tried using some DA on my arms and chest and received the same result of black greasepaint that was hard to remove. Tried mixing DA with more water, less water, hot water, and cold water to no avail. Sadly, I have to return my pot back to Lush wish fortunately isn&#x27;t far away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My batch wasn&#x27;t expired, not even close, so there is no reason for this not to work as before unless there are inadequacies with the manufacturer. I cannot recommend this product, because you really have no idea if you will get a good batch or a bad batch. If you live near a Lush store and don&#x27;t mind returning the product if it is bad, then I say go for it and try/use Dark Angels. Do not even think about purchasing this online, because if you get a bad batch you are stuck with it. This stuff is amazing when it works, but I&#x27;m not going to waste time and money looking for a good batch. When I returned it to the Lush store, the sales clerk admitted that they can get as many bad batches as they do good batches.is bad, then I say go for it and try/use Dark Angels.

            <li> Gross feeling, super coarse and super messy. Makes your face greasy.</li>
            <li> Smells awful. Maybe it smells better when you buy from Lush? Hard to say. That being said, it does a great job of cleaning and gently exfoliating my skin. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple weeks and I&#x27;ve already noticed by skin is more even and under control. Perhaps I just need to get over the smell. It&#x27;s such a harsh smell...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dark Angels for a year now, and I regret abandoning it a few weeks ago for Ocean Salt, which didn&#x27;t work well for me. Dark Angels have made my skin soft, glowing and does an AMAZING job with exfoliation! When you add water to it, make sure it&#x27;s wet enough to look muddy before applying to reduce black residue. My first photo shows my nose strip result right before using Dark Angels and my second photo shows the my result aftet a week I used Dark Angels!</li>
            <li> Was a bit hesitant to purchase this product because of the name but was pleasantly surprised by the results.Excellent product.</li>
            <li> love this for my skin.. do this once a week at night</li>
            <li> This is one of the best facial exfoliators I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - Very course for some serious exfoliation (probably not the best for sensitive skin.)&lt;br /&gt; - Pulls out the oil in your face so it can be drying but you should follow this with a moisturizer (great for oily skin!)&lt;br /&gt; - Smells unpleasant (charcoal) but goes away as soon as you rinse it off.&lt;br /&gt; - All natural! Lush always uses natural ingredients so you never have to worry about foreign chemicals.&lt;br /&gt; - You not only get a great product but you also support a great cause because Lush is cruelty free and are big time supporters of getting rid of animal testing.&lt;br /&gt; - This is handmade in batches so it&#x27;s fresh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have cystic acne or just really bad blackhead issues I&#x27;d highly recommend this as it cleared up my face after about 2 weeks (using every other day). If you like nice course abrasive scrubs then this is literally one of the best out there.</li>
            <li> Lush products are absolutely amazing!!! All natural and all organic. This is my favorite exfoliating product and clears acne almost right away!!! I give it a 20 star!!!</li>
            <li> I loved,  it really works and let your skin clean and soft. These organic products are the best thing in the world. The deliver was on time. Really good product!</li>
            <li> Best face product I have ever used. I swear by it. I use it about twice a week. Feels so good to use a natural product. Now I don&#x27;t like using non-natural products on my face.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  Do yourself a favor and buy this directly from Lush.  This product is twice as expensive on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Dark Angels is a gentle black sugar and charcoal scrub for oily skin. It leaves my oily skin feeling fresh and matte. I purchased my Dark Angels directly from the manufacturer for less than thirteen dollars (plus six dollars shipping).</li>
            <li> I use this when my skin is getting out of control, so it lasts ... Honestly I&#x27;ve had the same container since 2010, had to add water to it but works well</li>
