            <li>I was really looking forward to a quality Nag Champa scented lotion from a cool small company, but it was too good to be true.  </li>

            <li>It seems very over powering.  </li>

            <li> I LOVE this lotion! Its fragrance is actually noticeable and lingers for a few hours. I pair it with Patchouli oil and everyone always asks me what I&#x27;m wearing.

For the high price for such a small bottle, I would defintaly not recommend this product.</li>
