            <li>I have never been happier they look flawless!</li>
            <li>These are great quality!</li>
            <li>and I feel like I got a great deal!</li>
            <li>She and I absolutely loved them!</li>
            <li>otherwise you will smell like an oven lol.</li>
            <li>I have never been so happy with extensions, I have wigs and all that but wanted some clip ins</li>
            <li>The hair is good quality</li>
            <li>love !</li>
            <li>love !</li>
            <li>This is amazing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice hair</li>
            <li>but they are nice</li>
            <li>I love them but if u want a fuller head buy 2packs,there also a good quality</li>
            <li>But they are great for a night out every now and then or special occasion.</li>
            <li>it looks great blends with my own hair its the right amount of hair for me</li>
            <li>They are really nice love em.</li>
            <li>Omg I love these hair pieces.</li>
            <li>so you would need to buy like 3 packs of them to layer at the back of your head and then curl them, but for me they blend perfectly and I only wear them at night so they don&#x27;t need to be magnificent.</li>
            <li>I love this hair</li>
            <li>The extensions are OK</li>
            <li>She really like them and they work great.</li>
            <li>I clipped them all into one one single row of hair and that makes them look the best.</li>
            <li>There was a lot more than I imagined and the various sizes were great.</li>
            <li>and they were easy to put in no shedding either</li>
            <li>I did buy some additional hair extensions and sewed them to the front of the clips which made it a bit better but, ended up costing me more than if I had just purchased some proper clip in extensions.</li>
            <li>it looks real when its not so thick very soft the clips are secure its a great price love !</li>
            <li>Okay first off, these are so realistic and soft!</li>
            <li>Also, they are amazingly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The extensions came super early, arrived in a week.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my mom&#x27;s post-chemo hair (very thin/balding).</li>
            <li>but the bottoms are very thinned out.  </li>
            <li>I was so worried this wasnt real hair, but it worked so well for what I was trying to achieve.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very soft, totally worth getting especially since the price is very affordable.</li>
            <li>I liked that the individual pieces had enough clips and it was true to the color I ordered (black).</li>
            <li>They are cheap but for a few bucks you can get Kardashian locks for a night out.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you buy at least 3 packs otherwise</li>
            <li>The hair is soft but completely sparse.</li>
            <li>It provided extra thickness to my hair and curled really well.</li>
            <li>they are kind of thin</li>
            <li>They have the same shine as normal hair.</li>
            <li>but i thought with my thin hair they would still be okay.</li>

            <li> The hair is too thin but its ok less hair than expected</li>
            <li> but I tried washing them but that made them stiff and greasy somehow so I will throw them out and just buy a few new packs.</li>
            <li> Not to mention, the package came way before the expected date of delivery!</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an everyday use type extension keep looking because these are not it honey.</li>
            <li> These are not good for people who are using them for volume as oppose to length.</li>
            <li> Well these are thin</li>
            <li> they will be too thin and scraggely to blend.</li>
            <li> I read reviews on these being to thin</li>
            <li> the 1 pack is very thin, I have very thick hair.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair you will look ridiculous :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sorry,  </li>
            <li> so it looks silly.</li>
            <li> Very thin.</li>
            <li> Very thin.  </li>
            <li> Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Decided to experiment with this brand and regrettably it&#x27;s the worst to date.</li>

            <li> I bought these for my mom&#x27;s post-chemo hair (very thin/balding). She and I absolutely loved them! There was a lot more than I imagined and the various sizes were great. Also, they are amazingly soft and smooth. Not to mention, the package came way before the expected date of delivery! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Omg I love these hair pieces. They are cheap but for a few bucks you can get Kardashian locks for a night out. Well these are thin so you would need to buy like 3 packs of them to layer at the back of your head and then curl them, but for me they blend perfectly and I only wear them at night so they don&#x27;t need to be magnificent. I clipped them all into one one single row of hair and that makes them look the best. They are a silk blend so you can put heat on them but they do smell like it&#x27;s burning so you have to spray some perfume or something on the hair before you leave otherwise you will smell like an oven lol. If you&#x27;re looking for an everyday use type extension keep looking because these are not it honey. But they are great for a night out every now and then or special occasion. Just make sure you buy at least 3 packs otherwise they will be too thin and scraggely to blend. They don&#x27;t shed or tangle but I tried washing them but that made them stiff and greasy somehow so I will throw them out and just buy a few new packs. At this price no harm done!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying clip-ons for over 2 years. Decided to experiment with this brand and regrettably it&#x27;s the worst to date. Very thin. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I read reviews on these being to thin but i thought with my thin hair they would still be okay. I got them and reasonably fast but just like i read they are really toooo thin. Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I kinda wanted a refund. Very thin.  I&#x27;m so sorry,  it&#x27;s nice hair but the bottoms are very thinned out.  If you have thick hair you will look ridiculous :(</li>
            <li> I love this hair it looks great blends with my own hair its the right amount of hair for me you might want to buy 2 packs but I did not use all of the 7pcs it looks real when its not so thick very soft the clips are secure its a great price love ! love ! love ! this hair&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this hair again But Only This Seller !!!!</li>
            <li> I liked that the individual pieces had enough clips and it was true to the color I ordered (black). The hair is soft but completely sparse. These are not good for people who are using them for volume as oppose to length. I did buy some additional hair extensions and sewed them to the front of the clips which made it a bit better but, ended up costing me more than if I had just purchased some proper clip in extensions.</li>
            <li> The extensions are OK they are kind of thin but they are nice</li>
            <li> the 1 pack is very thin, I have very thick hair. Also this doesnt give volume, just length so it looks silly.</li>
            <li> The hair is too thin but its ok less hair than expected</li>
            <li> The extensions came super early, arrived in a week. They&#x27;re very soft, totally worth getting especially since the price is very affordable.</li>
            <li> Okay first off, these are so realistic and soft! I have never been so happy with extensions, I have wigs and all that but wanted some clip ins and these are a must buy omg I have never been happier they look flawless!</li>
            <li> These are great quality! I have a pixie cut and used them to make my hair into a bob as it grew out. No one could tell! They have the same shine as normal hair.</li>
            <li> Got these for my girlfriend. She really like them and they work great.</li>
            <li> I was so worried this wasnt real hair, but it worked so well for what I was trying to achieve. It provided extra thickness to my hair and curled really well. Later, we used it on a friend of mine to add volume. The hair is good quality and I feel like I got a great deal!</li>
            <li> I love them but if u want a fuller head buy 2packs,there also a good quality</li>
            <li> This is a 5 star for me because i never tried hair extensions i always wanted to so i bought them they came on the day they said it would come and they were easy to put in no shedding either</li>
            <li> They are really nice love em.</li>
