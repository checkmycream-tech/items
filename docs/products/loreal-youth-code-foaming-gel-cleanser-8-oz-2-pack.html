            <li>I&#x27;m glad I had saved an old bottle with the pump, because unfortunately-</li>

            <li> and it was terrible to clean all them off !</li>
            <li> It is a thick gel that lathers up to a foam.</li>

            <li> I use this product every night.  It does clean well, I like the scent of it and the most important aspect is that it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dehydrated.  Its a great option for an everyday night cleanser at a low price.  Highly recommend it!</li>

            <li> This is my second order.  Very gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry up my skin.  It does a good job removing make up.  Good price, will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I have not see this product in stores anymore and don&#x27;t know why.&lt;br /&gt;I really like it for washing my face everyday.</li>

            <li> Cleans well without drying out skin.  Ordered via Subscribe &amp; Save. Received products as described. Packaging was excellent and product was undamaged.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best facial cleansers I have used.  Leaves skin feeling wonderfully clean.  One of the best benefits is that is removes eye make up completely.  Perfect transaction and quick delivery, will purchase again.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used L&#x27;oreal Youth Code Foaming Gel for years. I love this product. Doesn&#x27;t strip the skins oil. And I can wash eye make up, mascara, and lipstick off with it. So easy to order 3 bottles at a time!</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser - it makes my skin feel great!  I have combination skin, and it cleanses without drying my skin out, and moisturizes without making my face feel oily (and it has a great scent - very light).  It&#x27;s also very reasonably priced compared with a lot of facial cleansers.  Can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore, so it was a relief to find it here - thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cleanser for awhile, years! LOVE the cleanser, it is fantastic and removes makeup without having to buy a separate product. But- I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore. I&#x27;m glad I had saved an old bottle with the pump, because unfortunately- out of the 4 bottles I ordered, only ONE had a functioning pump. All the others were broken. They spin around but will not depress so you can get the product out. &#x3D;( Not sure what the heck happened, but I can only assume it had something to do with the handling and packaging from the shipper. I did not have this issue when I was buying it in stores.</li>
            <li> This product makes your skin feel fresh and it has a nice smell to it. It is a thick gel that lathers up to a foam. I&#x27;ve used morning and night for a week and so far I can see a difference in my skin looking cleaner and feeling softer.</li>

            <li> Very good cleanser. Leaves skin slightly dry but clears skin up great. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 years now.</li>
            <li> Best face wash EVER!! Leaves face feeling super clean. I use a makeup remover as well but this face wash is awesome! I hope Loreal never discontinues this one!!</li>
            <li> cannot find this in the stores anymore, so I bought 2 of them.  hopefully it will be enough until I find something else.  My skin has changed since I have been using this product.  Pores are smaller and skin softer, cannot understand why they took this out of all the store.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and I am in love with this face wash ...</li>
            <li> I love this product! This is perfect for minimizing pores, evening face texture and removing impurities from the face. The shipping was perfect timing and overall I am pleased I ordered the pack of 2 so I won&#x27;t run out for a while!</li>
            <li> Wonderful face wash for even sensitive skin.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 months, it&#x27;s great and it lasts.</li>
            <li> this is the best facial cleanser I have found.  it is gentle and yet removes all of the makeup easily.</li>
            <li> Great price when you buy two.  Smells good, lathers well, and is acidic in removing dead skin layer and cleaning pores.</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my face feel!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It makes my face feels so soft. I&#x27;ve been using the loreal trio and decided to get this so I want use the trio up (because the bottles are small). But I think that every woman should have this product for your face. Using the loreal trio was a great product that&#x27;s why I bought this.</li>
