            <li>and it is really good for your skin.  </li>
            <li>Good, but was hoping it would be as invigorating as Trader&#x27; Joe&#x27;s (now discontinued) tea tree/peppermint body wash...</li>
            <li>Good shampoo.</li>
            <li>Nice and good for the skin</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>And, many &amp;#34;bugs&amp;#34; don&#x27;t like the peppermint!</li>
            <li>I love this body wash!</li>
            <li>It has a nice pepperminty smell and the Tree Tea Oil softens and smooths my skin.  </li>
            <li>Love this body wash - it smells so good, lathers well</li>
            <li>Still nice, though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also smells nice</li>
            <li>Very fresh and cooling, great for after exercise to eliminate sweat and odor.</li>
            <li>I love it, but I paid for it $6 in Amazon two weeks ago and now the price is $11.25?</li>
            <li>It is so refreshing--</li>
            <li>I love the smell of peppermint.</li>
            <li>i bought alot of it and was Glad i did.</li>
            <li>Really love the Teatree/Peppermint smell.  </li>
            <li>It is ok.</li>
            <li>Love using this.</li>
            <li>Feels fresh, smells good.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to have it be more like the &amp;#34;tea tree by paul mitchle&amp;#34; product</li>
            <li>Love this stuff. :-)</li>
            <li>goes way too fast, smells great</li>
            <li>This body wash smells great, not fake-y at all but very fresh and strong, like real peppermint.</li>
            <li>It does lather very nicely and my skin felt very soft.</li>
            <li>Smells great, does nice job and doesn&#x27;t over dry skin.</li>
            <li>With the Organix body wash, the peppermint wasn&#x27;t that strong</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell if it actually reduced my outbreaks yet, more time is needed, but its&#x27; refreshing peppermint wakes you up and makes you feel good.</li>
            <li>love this body wash--your refreshed after your a shower--priced nicely and goes a long ways--arrived wrapped so you won&#x27;t have top worry it&#x27;s leaked out</li>
            <li>and this wash relieves that .. I feel clean and itch free when I use it .</li>
            <li>this is to feeel clean.</li>
            <li>i frequently dye my hair in all sortsa places.. being honest here..</li>
            <li>both tea tree and peppermint are considered effective natural mosquito repellents.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really wish they would be true and put let harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>It is still nice, but there are other mint washes that I like better for their scent.</li>
            <li>I was super excited about this product, loved the smell right away...but found out it&#x27;s FULL of chemicals and not really &#x27;organic&#x27; at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Favorite soap so far.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, I have not had very many mosquito bites this year, and am totally convinced that the 20+ bites I had at any given time last year, all over my legs, as compared to the 3 bites I have had this whole year</li>
            <li>Unless it really does something to your hair, it&#x27;s just as good than any other shampoo.</li>
            <li>was exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>First time trying this brand of body wash, thought it might have a cooling effect of peppermint, but not so.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much of a difference using this body wash made until I ran out and had to switch to dove.</li>
            <li>Cant believe i paid that much for it</li>
            <li>It was too much of a risk to keep using, but had I still been ignorant</li>
            <li>but I expected more from it.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t linger too long for those who don&#x27;t enjoy that.</li>
            <li>Very soft and gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li>Usually when I buy tea tree oil products with peppermint in it, the peppermint is strong and you feel that fresh tingly feeling.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I love the shampoo and conditioner in this same scent - but the body wash is not nearly as scented.  </li>
            <li>Its not over powering with the scent and leaves your skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>although i was disheartened with the &amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34; action.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling clean with a little bit of a tingle.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled to bits and pieces that I am not covered in unsightly and irritating bites, and no longer avoid going outside, even at dusk.</li>
            <li>Barely smells of peppermint and there is no &amp;#34;soothing&amp;#34; effect.</li>
            <li>My skin has felt less dry than usual, and this smells really nice.</li>

            <li> Unfortunately I stopped using after I realized it was not truly organic and filled with chemicals that release formaldehyde (diazolidinyl urea).</li>
            <li> but that was not nearly the value of the product.  </li>

            <li> I have very dry itchy skin</li>
            <li> The sharp scent almost clears my sinuses.</li>
            <li> Other tea tree and mint products I use can be felt on the skin, but not this one.</li>
            <li> This body wash is a cream and only takes a small amount.  </li>
            <li> Does not make me feel like I have extra cleaning agents left behind.  </li>
            <li> I just get a little tired of the peppermint smell after a while.</li>
            <li> We were trying to find something that would take care of the fungus without having to take the medications that were not good for his kidneys.&lt;br /&gt;Since using this he has not had another issue with fungus and that has been over 2 years</li>
            <li> Very weak ingredients.  </li>
            <li> but no tingle :(</li>

            <li> love this body wash--your refreshed after your a shower--priced nicely and goes a long ways--arrived wrapped so you won&#x27;t have top worry it&#x27;s leaked out</li>
            <li> I love it, but I paid for it $6 in Amazon two weeks ago and now the price is $11.25? I wanted to buy it again, but not at this price. It is abusive.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect body wash for summer.  It is so refreshing--practically jumps out of the bottle when opened.  My skin did feel smoothe but that was not nearly the value of the product.  Leaves you tingling all over!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be a definite reorder.</li>
            <li> Gets me started in the Morning</li>
            <li> I just feel so refreshed after using this. The sharp scent almost clears my sinuses.</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much of a difference using this body wash made until I ran out and had to switch to dove. The dove makes my skin dry and doesn&#x27;t feel as \\&quot;clean\\&quot;as Organix does. I will stick to organix because it&#x27;s affordable and my skin loves it</li>
            <li> I didnt get the tingle feeling. And it irritated my skin. Definently wouldnt buy again. Cant believe i paid that much for it smh</li>
            <li> I have very dry itchy skin and this wash relieves that .. I feel clean and itch free when I use it .</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my doctor and I could not find it here in Auburn.  If one has dry skin it is healing and has a pleasant scent.</li>

            <li> Really love the Teatree/Peppermint smell.  Its not over powering with the scent and leaves your skin feeling soft.  Does not make me feel like I have extra cleaning agents left behind.  Very soft and gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to help alleviate some of my rosacea problems and like how it smells and makes me skin feel. I can&#x27;t tell if it actually reduced my outbreaks yet, more time is needed, but its&#x27; refreshing peppermint wakes you up and makes you feel good.</li>
            <li> This body wash is a cream and only takes a small amount.  It has a nice pepperminty smell and the Tree Tea Oil softens and smooths my skin.  I had dry irritated skin and this body wash was exactly what I needed.  This is a very good product for the price.</li>
            <li> Product was expired when I got it.</li>
            <li> This body wash actually surpised me. The body wash isn&#x27;t over powering as I thought, but makes me feel good and refreshed.</li>

            <li> Love this body wash - it smells so good, lathers well and it is really good for your skin.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> It is ok. I would suggest going with Bigelows Peppermint for the price.</li>
            <li> Nice and good for the skin I just get a little tired of the peppermint smell after a while. Will switch back yo coconut</li>
            <li> Great smell.  Leaves skin feeling clean with a little bit of a tingle.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! The scent is truly for DE-STRESSING!</li>
            <li> Good, but was hoping it would be as invigorating as Trader&#x27; Joe&#x27;s (now discontinued) tea tree/peppermint body wash...it&#x27;s milder.  Still nice, though.</li>
            <li> Christmas present for someone else.  They were very happy.</li>
            <li> Love using this. Feels fresh, smells good. And, many &amp;#34;bugs&amp;#34; don&#x27;t like the peppermint! I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> First time trying this brand of body wash, thought it might have a cooling effect of peppermint, but not so.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash! Very fresh and cooling, great for after exercise to eliminate sweat and odor. Has that herbal tea tree scent but it doesn&#x27;t linger too long for those who don&#x27;t enjoy that. I would definitely recommend and repurchase.</li>
            <li> Good shampoo. What can I say, it&#x27;s shampoo. Unless it really does something to your hair, it&#x27;s just as good than any other shampoo. That&#x27;s why I give it 3***.</li>
            <li> great product. although i was disheartened with the &amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34; action. I was hoping to have it be more like the &amp;#34;tea tree by paul mitchle&amp;#34; product but it&#x27;s still a great body wash.</li>
            <li> My skin has felt less dry than usual, and this smells really nice. Most importantly, I have not had very many mosquito bites this year, and am totally convinced that the 20+ bites I had at any given time last year, all over my legs, as compared to the 3 bites I have had this whole year (I have had none for the last 4 weeks) can be attributed to this body wash--both tea tree and peppermint are considered effective natural mosquito repellents. I am thrilled to bits and pieces that I am not covered in unsightly and irritating bites, and no longer avoid going outside, even at dusk. Love this stuff. :-)</li>
            <li> I was super excited about this product, loved the smell right away...but found out it&#x27;s FULL of chemicals and not really &#x27;organic&#x27; at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently converted but hadn&#x27;t been educated at reading labels at the time I ordered this. Unfortunately I stopped using after I realized it was not truly organic and filled with chemicals that release formaldehyde (diazolidinyl urea). It was too much of a risk to keep using, but had I still been ignorant I would have said it was a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really wish they would be true and put let harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> goes way too fast, smells great</li>
            <li> have used the shampoo - it is thick - this body wash is the exact opposite - doesn&#x27;t lather too well either</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo and conditioner in this same scent - but the body wash is not nearly as scented.  It is still nice, but there are other mint washes that I like better for their scent.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t dislike the product but I expected more from it. Usually when I buy tea tree oil products with peppermint in it, the peppermint is strong and you feel that fresh tingly feeling. With the Organix body wash, the peppermint wasn&#x27;t that strong and I didn&#x27;t feel that tingly feeling. It does lather very nicely and my skin felt very soft.</li>
            <li> My husband is immunosuppressed and has issues with fungus on his skin. We were trying to find something that would take care of the fungus without having to take the medications that were not good for his kidneys.&lt;br /&gt;Since using this he has not had another issue with fungus and that has been over 2 years and we used to have to treat it yearly.&lt;br /&gt;It also smells nice so that is an added bonus.</li>
