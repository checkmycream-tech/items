            <li>Have used the product for over 30 yrs.&lt;br /&gt;Light, distictive, not over powering.&lt;br /&gt;one of the best colognes that I have used over the years.</li>
            <li>I am very happy I got this.</li>
            <li>For my taste, and my wife&#x27;s, a superb choice in cologne.  </li>
            <li>Inexpensive and smells great!</li>
            <li>product is superb:  </li>
            <li>So when I saw it at Amazon, I was very delighted.</li>
            <li>Very good service on time and therefore also the size, and fragrance bottle</li>
            <li>a very good question.</li>
            <li>Ideal for men of any age.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice scent, and on my husband it smells amazing!!</li>
            <li>but it is a great value, with a flowery/citrusy scent that is plenty \\&quot;mannish\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Great to put on after a shower and in the evenings.</li>
            <li>A great buy for a great product.  </li>
            <li>Great value for the price.</li>
            <li>Great value and smell.</li>
            <li>Would recommend this product to any man at any age and ladies it would be great gift for the man in your life.</li>
            <li>Just purchased a bottle after all these years and it is still great.</li>
            <li>He was so happy his face lit up when he opened his Christmas gift.</li>
            <li>Great smell, like all Tabac products.</li>
            <li>so when I ordered this product I was happy they did NOT tamper with the fragrance as they did, adding a citrussy tone to the Eau de toilette.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of Tabac aftershave and the EDC matches the aftershave perfectly and the scent lasts all day on me.</li>
            <li>We have bought the product many years ago in Germany and were very impressed.  </li>
            <li>The citrus-floral notes have evaporated and there&#x27;s just a pleasant hint of powdery, spicy musk lingering on my skin.    </li>
            <li>After shave lotion even after the lapse of so many years and age catching the toll over me, as it is so wonderful to start a day with the good memories of the by gone days..</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell as good as their deodorant.</li>
            <li>A good amount of product for the money, and I like the bottle which dispenses the cologne in controllable amounts.</li>
            <li>I used to use this in the 1970&#x27;s and really loved the stuff.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, but just not as good as it used to be.  </li>
            <li>In 1966 a girlfriend gave me a gift of Tabac, I loved it as soon as I tried it.</li>
            <li>so since that discovery I been using it as a aftershave and loving it  loved the musky fragrance that lasts all day also goes great after using the tobac shave  soap .</li>
            <li>It was great to find this after many years of not seeing it in stores.</li>
            <li>RIGHT ON THE NOSE PERFECT!!</li>
            <li>I think the entire line of Tabac products are incredible and this cologne is the perfect partner to their shaving soap.</li>
            <li>This brawny cologne is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This fragrance is amazing.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, I bought it because the soap was really good</li>
            <li>This cologne blows away the trendy stuff you&#x27;ll find in a department store.</li>
            <li>Used it when I was a teenager and liked it and still do.</li>
            <li>I find it very balanced and all time best choice for me.  </li>
            <li>Tabac Original is a great perfume/cologne/after shave lotion.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with this purchase, I dont like  fragrances that are too sweet or flowery.  </li>
            <li>,it&#x27;s my favorite since years, bottle of 10.1 oz, best price and fast shipping,</li>
            <li>perfect, timeless masculine scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the original from Germany and just as good as it used to be.  </li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s a really interesting smell, and I really liked it, even though I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li>Definitely getting a great cologne at a great price</li>
            <li>is original, I am very satisfied and I would recommend</li>
            <li>Excellent new original product meeting my expectations</li>
            <li>The bottle is huge!</li>
            <li>Tabac is still my favorite</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>But Tabac is like an upscale version with more character.</li>
            <li>It may not make a man out of you, but it will make you a more manly man.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment on the topnotes etc., but I do love this scent.</li>
            <li>I love the Tabac fragrance.</li>
            <li>Love the scent of this cologne.</li>
            <li>Much more of a informal soapy scent, than a evening cologne</li>
            <li>The Tabac EDC is one of my favorite fragrances.  </li>
            <li>Go get it guys, the ladies love it...</li>
            <li>but I sure like this perfume.</li>
            <li>I am glad I found this product.</li>
            <li>This was such an excellent purchase...</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re over 50 or closer to 60 you&#x27;ll really love this stuff if you never got a chance to wear it before.</li>
            <li>Hope that helps:)</li>
            <li>I was glad when yet another bottle of my favorite cologne arrived.</li>
            <li>Now let&#x27;s get to the interesting part...</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be juggling the notion if you like this or Jovan Musk more.</li>
            <li>MOSTLY EUROPEANS WILL TEND TO RECOGNIZE THE NAME.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and all Tabac products.  </li>
            <li>At this price, it&#x27;s an outstanding buy.</li>
            <li>Have gotten many compliments on it.  </li>
            <li>Glad I found it here.</li>
            <li>I have used Tabac by MAURER &amp; WIRTZ for more years than most of you have been alive.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is just a pleasant, non overbearing, light and clean scent.</li>
            <li>To me its ok .</li>
            <li>but not my favorite</li>
            <li>This could well be the best fragrance deal on the net!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very unique for this market.  </li>
            <li>A very unique cologne.</li>
            <li>smell is not over powering and very unique.</li>
            <li>This is my go to cologne for work, it has a nice clean scent that I get a lot of compliments on</li>
            <li>Tabac has a very clean, citrus based scent.</li>
            <li>So glad I was able to find that it was still available.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s strong so use sparingly.</li>
            <li>I am 47 years old and to my nose this smells amazing!</li>
            <li>Tabac is smooth but strong.</li>
            <li>The white glass packaging is sturdy and looks great on the sink.  </li>
            <li>It is a great fragrance and the price does not compare to the local import stores.  </li>
            <li>Great choice for an independent guy!</li>
            <li>The lemon makes it nicer,it&#x27;s cheap and plentiful in what you&#x27;ll recieve,and lasts throughout the work day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and like nothing else on earth.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is unique, unlike anything else except for Tabac shaving soap.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is not quite like the original baack in the 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Original&#x27;s Scent:&lt;br /&gt;Someone&#x27;s probably asking &#x27;why would I recognize this scent&#x27;?</li>
            <li>I use Tabac original cologne as an aftershave lotion.  </li>
            <li>To me, it is a slighlty spicy clean essence.</li>
            <li>After all the trendy alcolhol colognes have come and gone, this iconic standard continues on and you don&#x27;t pay a yuppy price for it.</li>
            <li>Not too overpowering, but at the same time it lingers pleasantly.</li>
            <li>Tabac Original is an extraordinary fragrance.    </li>
            <li>If we consider the wide appeal and the great price point of Tabac - its a winner.  </li>
            <li>I use it as aftershave and its nice, strong, clean, and actually makes me feel like I came out of a nice old style barber.  </li>
            <li>Tabac is very citrusy and soapy and bergamot does interesting things with lavender.</li>
            <li>then I&#x27;ll finish with this EdC for the full Tabac treatment</li>
            <li>This has long been a favorite being neither too overpowering nor indistinguishable from a light scent as one might find with lemon soap despite mostly citrus notes.</li>
            <li>It is a rather LARGE bottle!!</li>
            <li>To me the smell is like a fresh powder leaving you smelling and feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>Quick ship.</li>
            <li>A great old school masculine cologne.</li>
            <li>It was shipped quickly by Perfumania.</li>
            <li>Heard about this scent from an older man, so wasn&#x27;t sure if we&#x27;d like it.</li>
            <li>Super to get this here in the USA.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super and a nifty aroma!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a classic \\&quot;old skool\\&quot; cologne but in a good way.</li>
            <li>Only reason I gave it 2 stars is because 10.1 ounces for around 20 bucks is a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cologne I actually enjoy wearing for my own sake, which I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve ever been able to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been shaving for a very long time and this cologne is excellent at refreshing your skin afterwards, especially if you are sensitive to razor burn.</li>
            <li>29 year old daughter says it is a sexy smell on her dad too, so maybe not an age</li>
            <li>Loving the Tabac soap so much, I expanded to the other products and find the EDC to be my favorite scent.  </li>
            <li>definitely praising the Tabac Original more.</li>
            <li>It seems to have right mix of notes.  </li>
            <li>A favorite from younger days, nice to have this fragrance back in my nostrils.</li>
            <li>Hadn&#x27;t bought any Tabac for a long time, but always liked the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Its original, simple, refreshing with a gentle and spicy feeling.</li>
            <li>and we both like it very much.</li>
            <li>when I was young it was fine regardless of age; that&#x27;s just how things change over time.  </li>
            <li>It is really hard to describe the fragrance of it and has to be experienced.  </li>
            <li>Many human memories are connected with the fragrances of the perfumes and the After Shave lotions one use.</li>
            <li>one 100ml bottle should last more than a year.</li>
            <li>Some of his choices have been, shall we say, questionable, but this one is great!!  </li>
            <li>found the scent to still be noticeable 4-5 hours after applying it in the morning and gone 7-8 hours after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;Great scent and did I mention this bottle is bowling-pin big? :-)</li>
            <li>It has such a fresh plant fragrance that it really feels as if you are in a tabaco plantation, I love it.</li>
            <li>My first impression for this product was that it&#x27;s a eau de toilette cologne spray  </li>
            <li>Smells exactly like the Tabac shaving soap.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I used this in Germany back in the 80&#x27;s and still love&#x27;n it</li>
            <li>Frankly I don&#x27;t care how many ingredients are in a cologne the big picture is what you smell.</li>
            <li>But Maurer &amp; Wirtz designed this scent character first</li>
            <li>BUT the scent was EXACTLY as to what the other reviewers said (the ones who liked it.</li>
            <li>Tabac is the light and refreshing scent that I remember my father using when I was a little kid.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The 10.5 ounce will last a long time and provides the best value over the smaller sizes.</li>
            <li>The bottle is huge in the sense a very large quantity for the price (only $20).</li>
            <li>Kind of chemically smelling when it dries down.</li>
            <li>My coisin from Germany (Very popular in Europe) gave it to me as a Christmas present years ago and will not use any other cologne.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on strong and blends and mellows in a short time.  </li>
            <li>Tabac scent is subtle yet accessible most of the day - making it perfect for workplace as well as casual wear.  </li>
            <li>so classic man scent!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a large glass bottle for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>The scent is a little like a nice pipe tabacco.</li>
            <li>Nice little plug that covers the spicket so that none leaks.</li>
            <li>This bottle is huge, I will be smelling sexy until at least Christmas</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell much like tobacco to me.</li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t quite what I was expecting - not all that &amp;#34;tobaccoish&amp;#34;, really, and I get the &amp;#34;old person&amp;#34; comments as a 20-something guy.</li>
            <li>I wore Tabac back in the &#x27;70s and didn&#x27;t realize that it was still available.</li>
            <li>But as inexpensive as Tabac is it really ridicules a lot of dollar cost from Guerlain&#x27;s Vetiver scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5-stars and highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I like it so much</li>
            <li>The size was surprising as it was much larger than I expected.  </li>
            <li>This french smelling cologne is very different from the status quo, definetly has a warm fragrance that changes with your body chemistry.</li>
            <li>For me it&#x27;s like an old friend that&#x27;s just right for me.  </li>
            <li>Tabac Original Eau de cologne is the same fragrance that has been around for decades.  </li>
            <li>It does not have the deep smell of the original one I bought</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I would purchase this product again as the original one was definitely a winner.  </li>
            <li>Apply judiciously and Tabac rewards you with a classic, clean, soft aroma that is undeniably masculine.    </li>
            <li>Very classy and comfortable at the same time.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s my only true grip-</li>
            <li>however it is not over powering and has never offended anyone, also decent quantity for price.</li>
            <li>A classic.</li>
            <li>but the word is steady.  </li>
            <li>Some people may find it a bit classic.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a clean, fresh franrance, not sweet or cloying and overpowering.  </li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Fragrances are very subjective, but I feel this could appeal to both young and older wearers.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;ll read a few reviews that this is more a cologne for older men and at 60 I have to agree.</li>
            <li>I like this as much as TOBS Sandalwood for a masculine scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since appreciated the change to the edt spray, but still prefer the old fragrance Tabac Cologne, and you can&#x27;t beat the amount you get for the price.</li>
            <li>Tabac is not a common brand nowadays when you have the Tommy and the Polo brands taking over everyone&#x27;s life.</li>
            <li>While this is a classic scent and is very masculine, I do NOT agree that it is a scent every man could wear.</li>
            <li>Recommend seller especially because they also have other great deals and low prices; not to mention the old fashioned smell that I enjoyed for a long, long time.</li>
            <li>The masculine scent is a blending of Black Pepper, Petit grain, Lemon, Bergamot, and Neroli in the Top notes; Lavender, Chamomile, Geranium and Oakwood absolu in the Heart notes; and Carnation, Sandalwood, Vetiver, Musk and Ambra in the Fond notes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon for providing this product can&#x27;t find it in any store where I live.  </li>
            <li>This smells a lot like Old Spice Classic to me.</li>
            <li>It is not too strong, but long lasting.</li>
            <li>but hey, I&#x27;m an old guy!</li>
            <li>The first thing that strikes a person is just how big the bottle is.</li>
            <li>My significant other loves the smell of this, and I&#x27;ve grown to also.</li>
            <li>My first use was in later 60&#x27;s when I was stationed in Germany.  </li>
            <li>I can not quite remember when I first used Tabac, but I&amp;#34;ll always remember the scent, especially hours after using.</li>
            <li>When I got this newer product, something seemed to be missing, so I checked against the older product and my thought was confirmed.  </li>
            <li>And I like the fact that it&#x27;s not a young guys scent of the moment or current fad; just clean, nice, subtle and...me.</li>
            <li>If this is how an old man is suppose to smell than I guess I am an old man!  </li>
            <li>Its one of  my Dad&#x27;s favorite colognes but hard to find in retail stores.  </li>
            <li>When I originally got the shave soap, I hated the scent from the word go; the EDC lacks the strong floral component and is much more pleasing to my nose.</li>
            <li>I stumbled upon Tabac while sampling all the various products available to the wet shaver.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got an old skool smell</li>
            <li>Color me genuinely surprised.</li>
            <li>Its been in production for nearly 50 years and has stood the test of time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It receives postive compliments from women young and old.  </li>
            <li>Stick with Old Spice for an old-school cologne.</li>
            <li>Which only added to my enjoyment of a scent for the ages masculine with just enough citrus to create that morning fresh fragrance...</li>
            <li>the delivery was one day early</li>
            <li>IT IS LIKE THE OLD SPICE OF THE UNITED STATES.</li>
            <li>My wife thinks it is old man stink.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I want to smell like an old school gentleman.  </li>
            <li>Too far to go when it runs out, so VG that I can now find and buy it in the USA.</li>
            <li>Perhaps a gentleman in his 40s could wear this scent, but that&#x27;s as far as I would go.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s different levels to it and all blend well throughout the day; but after describing all the various layer of scents they combine to result in fresh to me.</li>
            <li>It is definitely geared for older gentleman.</li>
            <li>The bottle is also very large and will last for a long time.</li>
            <li>This is for men who are manly, and who not afraid to display their manliness, to women or men who may be less manly than themselves.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 24 years old, and this stuff smells like you walked into a retirement home and sniffed an old white guy in a wheel chair.</li>
            <li>Whenever the scent fades, you are left with a very powdery smell very similar to baby powder.</li>
            <li>Wow, these are some enormous bottles but the Tabac is such a classic, timeless scent you won&#x27;t mind wearing it</li>
            <li>Unique -- and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>My only grip is that it does take quite a bit to get decent lasting power with this cologne.</li>
            <li>Another similar scent like Tabac aside from a few other notes to be more expansive...</li>
            <li>But then again the scent is like a mixture of incredibly old man - toilet water.</li>
            <li>No, not a wide open mouth like you&#x27;d think spilling a bunch all over the place as one might expect.</li>
            <li>bag\\&quot; in the least (but could be if over-applied), and very much appeals to me despite my young age.    </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if mine has aged, but it smells different than this new one I just received.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I would give it a -1, BUT, In all fairness, it did live up to the expectations of all the other reviewers who gave it a 5 (or 4).</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Have used the product for over 30 yrs.&lt;br /&gt;Light, distictive, not over powering.&lt;br /&gt;one of the best colognes that I have used over the years.</li>
            <li> I am very happy I got this.</li>
            <li> For my taste, and my wife&#x27;s, a superb choice in cologne.  </li>
            <li> Inexpensive and smells great!</li>
            <li> product is superb:  </li>
            <li> So when I saw it at Amazon, I was very delighted.</li>
            <li> Very good service on time and therefore also the size, and fragrance bottle</li>
            <li> a very good question.</li>
            <li> Ideal for men of any age.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice scent, and on my husband it smells amazing!!</li>
            <li> but it is a great value, with a flowery/citrusy scent that is plenty \\&quot;mannish\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Great to put on after a shower and in the evenings.</li>
            <li> A great buy for a great product.  </li>
            <li> Great value for the price.</li>
            <li> Great value and smell.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this product to any man at any age and ladies it would be great gift for the man in your life.</li>
            <li> Just purchased a bottle after all these years and it is still great.</li>
            <li> He was so happy his face lit up when he opened his Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> Great smell, like all Tabac products.</li>
            <li> so when I ordered this product I was happy they did NOT tamper with the fragrance as they did, adding a citrussy tone to the Eau de toilette.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of Tabac aftershave and the EDC matches the aftershave perfectly and the scent lasts all day on me.</li>
            <li> We have bought the product many years ago in Germany and were very impressed.  </li>
            <li> The citrus-floral notes have evaporated and there&#x27;s just a pleasant hint of powdery, spicy musk lingering on my skin.    </li>
            <li> After shave lotion even after the lapse of so many years and age catching the toll over me, as it is so wonderful to start a day with the good memories of the by gone days..</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell as good as their deodorant.</li>
            <li> A good amount of product for the money, and I like the bottle which dispenses the cologne in controllable amounts.</li>
            <li> I used to use this in the 1970&#x27;s and really loved the stuff.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but just not as good as it used to be.  </li>
            <li> In 1966 a girlfriend gave me a gift of Tabac, I loved it as soon as I tried it.</li>
            <li> so since that discovery I been using it as a aftershave and loving it  loved the musky fragrance that lasts all day also goes great after using the tobac shave  soap .</li>
            <li> It was great to find this after many years of not seeing it in stores.</li>
            <li> RIGHT ON THE NOSE PERFECT!!</li>
            <li> I think the entire line of Tabac products are incredible and this cologne is the perfect partner to their shaving soap.</li>
            <li> This brawny cologne is amazing.  </li>
            <li> This fragrance is amazing.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, I bought it because the soap was really good</li>
            <li> This cologne blows away the trendy stuff you&#x27;ll find in a department store.</li>
            <li> Used it when I was a teenager and liked it and still do.</li>
            <li> I find it very balanced and all time best choice for me.  </li>
            <li> Tabac Original is a great perfume/cologne/after shave lotion.  </li>
            <li> I am happy with this purchase, I dont like  fragrances that are too sweet or flowery.  </li>
            <li> ,it&#x27;s my favorite since years, bottle of 10.1 oz, best price and fast shipping,</li>
            <li> perfect, timeless masculine scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the original from Germany and just as good as it used to be.  </li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s a really interesting smell, and I really liked it, even though I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li> Definitely getting a great cologne at a great price</li>
            <li> is original, I am very satisfied and I would recommend</li>
            <li> Excellent new original product meeting my expectations</li>
            <li> The bottle is huge!</li>
            <li> Tabac is still my favorite</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> But Tabac is like an upscale version with more character.</li>
            <li> It may not make a man out of you, but it will make you a more manly man.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on the topnotes etc., but I do love this scent.</li>
            <li> I love the Tabac fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love the scent of this cologne.</li>
            <li> Much more of a informal soapy scent, than a evening cologne</li>
            <li> The Tabac EDC is one of my favorite fragrances.  </li>
            <li> Go get it guys, the ladies love it...</li>
            <li> but I sure like this perfume.</li>
            <li> I am glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> This was such an excellent purchase...</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re over 50 or closer to 60 you&#x27;ll really love this stuff if you never got a chance to wear it before.</li>
            <li> Hope that helps:)</li>
            <li> I was glad when yet another bottle of my favorite cologne arrived.</li>
            <li> Now let&#x27;s get to the interesting part...</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be juggling the notion if you like this or Jovan Musk more.</li>
            <li> MOSTLY EUROPEANS WILL TEND TO RECOGNIZE THE NAME.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and all Tabac products.  </li>
            <li> At this price, it&#x27;s an outstanding buy.</li>
            <li> Have gotten many compliments on it.  </li>
            <li> Glad I found it here.</li>
            <li> I have used Tabac by MAURER &amp; WIRTZ for more years than most of you have been alive.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is just a pleasant, non overbearing, light and clean scent.</li>
            <li> To me its ok .</li>
            <li> but not my favorite</li>
            <li> This could well be the best fragrance deal on the net!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very unique for this market.  </li>
            <li> A very unique cologne.</li>
            <li> smell is not over powering and very unique.</li>
            <li> This is my go to cologne for work, it has a nice clean scent that I get a lot of compliments on</li>
            <li> Tabac has a very clean, citrus based scent.</li>
            <li> So glad I was able to find that it was still available.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s strong so use sparingly.</li>
            <li> I am 47 years old and to my nose this smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Tabac is smooth but strong.</li>
            <li> The white glass packaging is sturdy and looks great on the sink.  </li>
            <li> It is a great fragrance and the price does not compare to the local import stores.  </li>
            <li> Great choice for an independent guy!</li>
            <li> The lemon makes it nicer,it&#x27;s cheap and plentiful in what you&#x27;ll recieve,and lasts throughout the work day.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic and like nothing else on earth.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is unique, unlike anything else except for Tabac shaving soap.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is not quite like the original baack in the 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Original&#x27;s Scent:&lt;br /&gt;Someone&#x27;s probably asking &#x27;why would I recognize this scent&#x27;?</li>
            <li> I use Tabac original cologne as an aftershave lotion.  </li>
            <li> To me, it is a slighlty spicy clean essence.</li>
            <li> After all the trendy alcolhol colognes have come and gone, this iconic standard continues on and you don&#x27;t pay a yuppy price for it.</li>
            <li> Not too overpowering, but at the same time it lingers pleasantly.</li>
            <li> Tabac Original is an extraordinary fragrance.    </li>
            <li> If we consider the wide appeal and the great price point of Tabac - its a winner.  </li>
            <li> I use it as aftershave and its nice, strong, clean, and actually makes me feel like I came out of a nice old style barber.  </li>
            <li> Tabac is very citrusy and soapy and bergamot does interesting things with lavender.</li>
            <li> then I&#x27;ll finish with this EdC for the full Tabac treatment</li>
            <li> This has long been a favorite being neither too overpowering nor indistinguishable from a light scent as one might find with lemon soap despite mostly citrus notes.</li>
            <li> It is a rather LARGE bottle!!</li>
            <li> To me the smell is like a fresh powder leaving you smelling and feeling clean.  </li>
            <li> Quick ship.</li>
            <li> A great old school masculine cologne.</li>
            <li> It was shipped quickly by Perfumania.</li>
            <li> Heard about this scent from an older man, so wasn&#x27;t sure if we&#x27;d like it.</li>
            <li> Super to get this here in the USA.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super and a nifty aroma!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a classic \\&quot;old skool\\&quot; cologne but in a good way.</li>
            <li> Only reason I gave it 2 stars is because 10.1 ounces for around 20 bucks is a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cologne I actually enjoy wearing for my own sake, which I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve ever been able to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been shaving for a very long time and this cologne is excellent at refreshing your skin afterwards, especially if you are sensitive to razor burn.</li>
            <li> 29 year old daughter says it is a sexy smell on her dad too, so maybe not an age</li>
            <li> Loving the Tabac soap so much, I expanded to the other products and find the EDC to be my favorite scent.  </li>
            <li> definitely praising the Tabac Original more.</li>
            <li> It seems to have right mix of notes.  </li>
            <li> A favorite from younger days, nice to have this fragrance back in my nostrils.</li>
            <li> Hadn&#x27;t bought any Tabac for a long time, but always liked the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Its original, simple, refreshing with a gentle and spicy feeling.</li>
            <li> and we both like it very much.</li>
            <li> when I was young it was fine regardless of age; that&#x27;s just how things change over time.  </li>
            <li> It is really hard to describe the fragrance of it and has to be experienced.  </li>
            <li> Many human memories are connected with the fragrances of the perfumes and the After Shave lotions one use.</li>
            <li> one 100ml bottle should last more than a year.</li>
            <li> Some of his choices have been, shall we say, questionable, but this one is great!!  </li>
            <li> found the scent to still be noticeable 4-5 hours after applying it in the morning and gone 7-8 hours after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;Great scent and did I mention this bottle is bowling-pin big? :-)</li>
            <li> It has such a fresh plant fragrance that it really feels as if you are in a tabaco plantation, I love it.</li>
            <li> My first impression for this product was that it&#x27;s a eau de toilette cologne spray  </li>
            <li> Smells exactly like the Tabac shaving soap.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I used this in Germany back in the 80&#x27;s and still love&#x27;n it</li>
            <li> Frankly I don&#x27;t care how many ingredients are in a cologne the big picture is what you smell.</li>
            <li> But Maurer &amp; Wirtz designed this scent character first</li>
            <li> BUT the scent was EXACTLY as to what the other reviewers said (the ones who liked it.</li>
            <li> Tabac is the light and refreshing scent that I remember my father using when I was a little kid.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The 10.5 ounce will last a long time and provides the best value over the smaller sizes.</li>
            <li> The bottle is huge in the sense a very large quantity for the price (only $20).</li>
            <li> Kind of chemically smelling when it dries down.</li>
            <li> My coisin from Germany (Very popular in Europe) gave it to me as a Christmas present years ago and will not use any other cologne.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes on strong and blends and mellows in a short time.  </li>
            <li> Tabac scent is subtle yet accessible most of the day - making it perfect for workplace as well as casual wear.  </li>
            <li> so classic man scent!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a large glass bottle for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> The scent is a little like a nice pipe tabacco.</li>
            <li> Nice little plug that covers the spicket so that none leaks.</li>
            <li> This bottle is huge, I will be smelling sexy until at least Christmas</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell much like tobacco to me.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t quite what I was expecting - not all that &amp;#34;tobaccoish&amp;#34;, really, and I get the &amp;#34;old person&amp;#34; comments as a 20-something guy.</li>
            <li> I wore Tabac back in the &#x27;70s and didn&#x27;t realize that it was still available.</li>
            <li> But as inexpensive as Tabac is it really ridicules a lot of dollar cost from Guerlain&#x27;s Vetiver scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5-stars and highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I like it so much</li>
            <li> The size was surprising as it was much larger than I expected.  </li>
            <li> This french smelling cologne is very different from the status quo, definetly has a warm fragrance that changes with your body chemistry.</li>
            <li> For me it&#x27;s like an old friend that&#x27;s just right for me.  </li>
            <li> Tabac Original Eau de cologne is the same fragrance that has been around for decades.  </li>
            <li> It does not have the deep smell of the original one I bought</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I would purchase this product again as the original one was definitely a winner.  </li>
            <li> Apply judiciously and Tabac rewards you with a classic, clean, soft aroma that is undeniably masculine.    </li>
            <li> Very classy and comfortable at the same time.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my only true grip-</li>
            <li> however it is not over powering and has never offended anyone, also decent quantity for price.</li>
            <li> A classic.</li>
            <li> but the word is steady.  </li>
            <li> Some people may find it a bit classic.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a clean, fresh franrance, not sweet or cloying and overpowering.  </li>
            <li> highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Fragrances are very subjective, but I feel this could appeal to both young and older wearers.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;ll read a few reviews that this is more a cologne for older men and at 60 I have to agree.</li>
            <li> I like this as much as TOBS Sandalwood for a masculine scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since appreciated the change to the edt spray, but still prefer the old fragrance Tabac Cologne, and you can&#x27;t beat the amount you get for the price.</li>
            <li> Tabac is not a common brand nowadays when you have the Tommy and the Polo brands taking over everyone&#x27;s life.</li>
            <li> While this is a classic scent and is very masculine, I do NOT agree that it is a scent every man could wear.</li>
            <li> Recommend seller especially because they also have other great deals and low prices; not to mention the old fashioned smell that I enjoyed for a long, long time.</li>
            <li> The masculine scent is a blending of Black Pepper, Petit grain, Lemon, Bergamot, and Neroli in the Top notes; Lavender, Chamomile, Geranium and Oakwood absolu in the Heart notes; and Carnation, Sandalwood, Vetiver, Musk and Ambra in the Fond notes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thank you Amazon for providing this product can&#x27;t find it in any store where I live.  </li>
            <li> This smells a lot like Old Spice Classic to me.</li>
            <li> It is not too strong, but long lasting.</li>
            <li> but hey, I&#x27;m an old guy!</li>
            <li> The first thing that strikes a person is just how big the bottle is.</li>
            <li> My significant other loves the smell of this, and I&#x27;ve grown to also.</li>
            <li> My first use was in later 60&#x27;s when I was stationed in Germany.  </li>
            <li> I can not quite remember when I first used Tabac, but I&amp;#34;ll always remember the scent, especially hours after using.</li>
            <li> When I got this newer product, something seemed to be missing, so I checked against the older product and my thought was confirmed.  </li>
            <li> And I like the fact that it&#x27;s not a young guys scent of the moment or current fad; just clean, nice, subtle and...me.</li>
            <li> If this is how an old man is suppose to smell than I guess I am an old man!  </li>
            <li> Its one of  my Dad&#x27;s favorite colognes but hard to find in retail stores.  </li>
            <li> When I originally got the shave soap, I hated the scent from the word go; the EDC lacks the strong floral component and is much more pleasing to my nose.</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon Tabac while sampling all the various products available to the wet shaver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got an old skool smell</li>
            <li> Color me genuinely surprised.</li>
            <li> Its been in production for nearly 50 years and has stood the test of time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It receives postive compliments from women young and old.  </li>
            <li> Stick with Old Spice for an old-school cologne.</li>
            <li> Which only added to my enjoyment of a scent for the ages masculine with just enough citrus to create that morning fresh fragrance...</li>
            <li> the delivery was one day early</li>
            <li> IT IS LIKE THE OLD SPICE OF THE UNITED STATES.</li>
            <li> My wife thinks it is old man stink.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I want to smell like an old school gentleman.  </li>
            <li> Too far to go when it runs out, so VG that I can now find and buy it in the USA.</li>
            <li> Perhaps a gentleman in his 40s could wear this scent, but that&#x27;s as far as I would go.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s different levels to it and all blend well throughout the day; but after describing all the various layer of scents they combine to result in fresh to me.</li>
            <li> It is definitely geared for older gentleman.</li>
            <li> The bottle is also very large and will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is for men who are manly, and who not afraid to display their manliness, to women or men who may be less manly than themselves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 24 years old, and this stuff smells like you walked into a retirement home and sniffed an old white guy in a wheel chair.</li>
            <li> Whenever the scent fades, you are left with a very powdery smell very similar to baby powder.</li>
            <li> Wow, these are some enormous bottles but the Tabac is such a classic, timeless scent you won&#x27;t mind wearing it</li>
            <li> Unique -- and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> My only grip is that it does take quite a bit to get decent lasting power with this cologne.</li>
            <li> Another similar scent like Tabac aside from a few other notes to be more expansive...</li>
            <li> But then again the scent is like a mixture of incredibly old man - toilet water.</li>
            <li> No, not a wide open mouth like you&#x27;d think spilling a bunch all over the place as one might expect.</li>
            <li> bag\\&quot; in the least (but could be if over-applied), and very much appeals to me despite my young age.    </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if mine has aged, but it smells different than this new one I just received.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I would give it a -1, BUT, In all fairness, it did live up to the expectations of all the other reviewers who gave it a 5 (or 4).</li>
            <li> It definitely has a heavy powder note to the scent that is indicative of men in their 50s or older.</li>
            <li> First it is hard to find, second</li>
            <li> if you long for the traditional barbershop scents you remember as a child, tabac is for you!</li>
            <li> Tabac is the only cologne I use, and as long as I can get ot</li>
            <li> Still had some in storage from a long time back.  </li>
            <li> It does not last that long for me.</li>
            <li> It is also very long lasting.  </li>
            <li> Somehow, the morning ritual is not complete without a splash of Tabac.</li>
            <li> Starts off with a obvious citrus aroma after a short while down to a powdery aroma.</li>
            <li> For anyone younger, I would recommend something a bit less powdery, a bit sweeter, but still as spicy, such as Havana.</li>
            <li> To this day I still have the same bottle with just a few drops left.  </li>
            <li> For a fragrance with such a complex tree of notes, it boils down to a soft musk that&#x27;s so simple but oh-so-masculine.</li>

            <li> This is not at ALL what I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find though.  </li>
            <li> a subtle masculine scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Long story short, after a few weeks, I&#x27;m not sure if I could stomach</li>
            <li> do not know of any other place where I can purchase this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, it sucks.</li>

            <li> Not a bold scent nor can&#x27;t smell at all</li>

            <li> Nevermind the negative reviews, go ahead and wear this scent with confidence.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d splash a little on during the day from time to time, and noticed that it was actually very subtle, sort of distinguished.</li>
            <li> A subtle, inoffensive scent, and the scent lingers through the day.</li>
            <li> This cologne is not for everybody, as it has a very complex fragrance; like the smell of a hardwood forest after a rain shower.</li>
            <li> Tabac is difficult to find in dept stores or shopping malls.</li>
            <li> it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Now I have to admit for being just shy of under $20 and getting 10.1oz of this cologne from Germany.</li>
            <li> this scent is weird to me.</li>
            <li> I hate smelling like baby powder if I can&#x27;t reapply!</li>

            <li> Many human memories are connected with the fragrances of the perfumes and the After Shave lotions one use. The smell of Tabac takes me back to my childhood days.The smell and the brand name Tabac reminds me of my Father who is no more now..!It also give the nostalgic memories of the few German friends of my Dad who frequently visited my home during the late 60&#x27;s, when I was a school boy. Tabac is still my favorite After shave lotion even after the lapse of so many years and age catching the toll over me, as it is so wonderful to start a day with the good memories of the by gone days..K.A.Joseph,Cochin.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, I bought it because the soap was really good and it&#x27;s become my daily aftershave.</li>
            <li> This cologne blows away the trendy stuff you&#x27;ll find in a department store. It&#x27;s got an old skool smell but hey, I&#x27;m an old guy!</li>
            <li> Tabac Original Eau de cologne is the same fragrance that has been around for decades.  The masculine scent is a blending of Black Pepper, Petit grain, Lemon, Bergamot, and Neroli in the Top notes; Lavender, Chamomile, Geranium and Oakwood absolu in the Heart notes; and Carnation, Sandalwood, Vetiver, Musk and Ambra in the Fond notes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on strong and blends and mellows in a short time.  A perfect, timeless masculine scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a large glass bottle for a reasonable price.  Imported from Germany.</li>
            <li> I like this cologne but my wife just loves it.... so naturellement I use it!!! :) Vive l&#x27;amour......</li>
            <li> Tabac may not have the cache of a British or French scent but it is a great value, with a flowery/citrusy scent that is plenty \\&quot;mannish\\&quot;.  God bless.</li>
            <li> Let me put it as simply as possible:  Tabac Original is an extraordinary fragrance.    It&#x27;s been several hours now and I can still get wafts of this stuff from time to time (and I only applied a little). The citrus-floral notes have evaporated and there&#x27;s just a pleasant hint of powdery, spicy musk lingering on my skin.    But it&#x27;s the drydown that blows me away. It&#x27;s exquisite. Throughout the development of the fragrance there are hints of synthetic 60&#x27;s/70&#x27;s chintziness (probably the aldehydes?), but it&#x27;s so well-blended that it never comes to the fore. Then the drydown kicks in and there&#x27;s no doubt that this is timeless. For a fragrance with such a complex tree of notes, it boils down to a soft musk that&#x27;s so simple but oh-so-masculine. This is not at ALL what I expected. When I originally got the shave soap, I hated the scent from the word go; the EDC lacks the strong floral component and is much more pleasing to my nose. This isn&#x27;t \\&quot;Grandma&#x27;s make-up bag\\&quot; in the least (but could be if over-applied), and very much appeals to me despite my young age.    The closest thing to it that we have in the US is Aqua Velva Musk. But Tabac is like an upscale version with more character. It&#x27;s very unique for this market.  It&#x27;s nothing like what you get at the department store counter.    Color me genuinely surprised. I expected a floral, soapy quasi-manly Euro scent; what I got was a blend of citrus, soft florals, powder, musk, spice and woods. Apply judiciously and Tabac rewards you with a classic, clean, soft aroma that is undeniably masculine.    Ideal for men of any age.</li>
            <li> This is for men who are manly, and who not afraid to display their manliness, to women or men who may be less manly than themselves. It may not make a man out of you, but it will make you a more manly man.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 24 years old, and this stuff smells like you walked into a retirement home and sniffed an old white guy in a wheel chair. Only reason I gave it 2 stars is because 10.1 ounces for around 20 bucks is a pretty good deal. But then again the scent is like a mixture of incredibly old man - toilet water. Overall, it sucks.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on the topnotes etc., but I do love this scent. My only grip is that it does take quite a bit to get decent lasting power with this cologne. Whenever the scent fades, you are left with a very powdery smell very similar to baby powder. That&#x27;s my only true grip- I hate smelling like baby powder if I can&#x27;t reapply!</li>
            <li> RIGHT ON THE NOSE PERFECT!!</li>
            <li> Great deal for the price!  Get compliments on the smell - not too \\&quot;sweet\\&quot; or over-powering.</li>
            <li> Tabac is not a common brand nowadays when you have the Tommy and the Polo brands taking over everyone&#x27;s life. Tabac is difficult to find in dept stores or shopping malls. So when I saw it at Amazon, I was very delighted. I ordered two bottles (the aftershave and the Eau de Toilette). I love the Tabac fragrance. Its original, simple, refreshing with a gentle and spicy feeling. Great to put on after a shower and in the evenings. I had no idea that 10 oz. was 100ml. The bottle is huge in the sense a very large quantity for the price (only $20). I checked the price at specialty perfume retailers and it was over $95! Even if you use it everyday (which I do) one 100ml bottle should last more than a year. Buy it.</li>
            <li> Tabac is the light and refreshing scent that I remember my father using when I was a little kid.&lt;br /&gt;This has been my daily after shave and body splash all summer and I don&#x27;t want to ever do without.&lt;br /&gt;Very highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING IT SINCE 1964</li>
            <li> This bottle is huge, I will be smelling sexy until at least Christmas</li>
            <li> This has long been a favorite being neither too overpowering nor indistinguishable from a light scent as one might find with lemon soap despite mostly citrus notes. It was great to find this after many years of not seeing it in stores.</li>
            <li> The first thing that strikes a person is just how big the bottle is. Your buying a lot of cologne, you can wear it daily and not worry about running low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a classic \\&quot;old skool\\&quot; cologne but in a good way. Its been in production for nearly 50 years and has stood the test of time.&lt;br /&gt;It has a clean, fresh franrance, not sweet or cloying and overpowering.  The fragrance is unique, unlike anything else except for Tabac shaving soap.  I am happy with this purchase, I dont like  fragrances that are too sweet or flowery.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice scent, and on my husband it smells amazing!! Some of his choices have been, shall we say, questionable, but this one is great!!  Not too overpowering, a subtle masculine scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 29 year old daughter says it is a sexy smell on her dad too, so maybe not an age thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Love the scent of this cologne.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of Tabac aftershave and the EDC matches the aftershave perfectly and the scent lasts all day on me.</li>
            <li> This is my go to cologne for work, it has a nice clean scent that I get a lot of compliments on however it is not over powering and has never offended anyone, also decent quantity for price.</li>
            <li> this fragrance brings back the days of yesteryear. if you long for the traditional barbershop scents you remember as a child, tabac is for you! similar in fragrance to florida water. a great value!</li>
            <li> We have bought the product many years ago in Germany and were very impressed.  The scent is not overwhelming and it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> Everyone has a different taste, but this is one of those colognes that can barely ever be criticized as bad, but I also find a lot of people asking me what cologne I use.  Much more of a informal soapy scent, than a evening cologne</li>
            <li> The Tabac EDC is one of my favorite fragrances.  I stumbled upon Tabac while sampling all the various products available to the wet shaver. Loving the Tabac soap so much, I expanded to the other products and find the EDC to be my favorite scent.  It is really hard to describe the fragrance of it and has to be experienced.  To me, it is a slighlty spicy clean essence. It grows on you.  Somehow, the morning ritual is not complete without a splash of Tabac. The white glass packaging is sturdy and looks great on the sink.  Tabac scent is subtle yet accessible most of the day - making it perfect for workplace as well as casual wear.  It receives postive compliments from women young and old.  If we consider the wide appeal and the great price point of Tabac - its a winner.  Fragrances are very subjective, but I feel this could appeal to both young and older wearers.  Tabac might be the ticket for a younger guy looking to graduate from Axe.  It was for me.</li>
            <li> Wow, these are some enormous bottles but the Tabac is such a classic, timeless scent you won&#x27;t mind wearing it daily.&lt;br /&gt;I found the scent to still be noticeable 4-5 hours after applying it in the morning and gone 7-8 hours after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;Great scent and did I mention this bottle is bowling-pin big? :-)</li>
            <li> First it is hard to find, second I bought everything else and it did not satisfy me, third I&#x27;m hard to please !</li>
            <li> This cologne is definetly the same stuff I purchased on my trip to Germany.  It is a great fragrance and the price does not compare to the local import stores.  A great buy for a great product.  Go get it guys, the ladies love it...</li>
            <li> A favorite from younger days, nice to have this fragrance back in my nostrils. Tabac has a very clean, citrus based scent. Present, but not overpowering. A classic.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t smoke TABACO but I sure like this perfume. It has such a fresh plant fragrance that it really feels as if you are in a tabaco plantation, I love it.</li>
            <li> Excellent item. Great value for the price.</li>
            <li> Used it when I was a teenager and liked it and still do. Great value and smell.</li>
            <li> Excellent new original product meeting my expectations,it&#x27;s my favorite since years, bottle of 10.1 oz, best price and fast shipping, thanks</li>
            <li> The scent takes some getting used to, but the wife likes it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell as good as their deodorant. Kind of chemically smelling when it dries down. Stick with Old Spice for an old-school cologne.</li>
            <li> Very good service on time and therefore also the size, and fragrance bottle is original, I am very satisfied and I would recommend</li>
            <li> Excellent!  Wife loves the smell too.  I like this as much as TOBS Sandalwood for a masculine scent.</li>
            <li> My significant other loves the smell of this, and I&#x27;ve grown to also. A good amount of product for the money, and I like the bottle which dispenses the cologne in controllable amounts.</li>
            <li> My first impression for this product was that it&#x27;s a eau de toilette cologne spray  but after doing some research online came to find out that cologne splash is actually a after shave  so since that discovery I been using it as a aftershave and loving it  loved the musky fragrance that lasts all day also goes great after using the tobac shave  soap .</li>
            <li> After all the trendy alcolhol colognes have come and gone, this iconic standard continues on and you don&#x27;t pay a yuppy price for it.</li>
            <li> My coisin from Germany (Very popular in Europe) gave it to me as a Christmas present years ago and will not use any other cologne.  Not a bold scent nor can&#x27;t smell at all but the word is steady.  Lasts for about 6 to 7 hours.  The soap and deodrant complement the cologne well.  Thank you Amazon for providing this product can&#x27;t find it in any store where I live.  Would recommend this product to any man at any age and ladies it would be great gift for the man in your life.</li>
            <li> Smells exactly like the Tabac shaving soap. That&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> A very unique cologne. Starts off with a obvious citrus aroma after a short while down to a powdery aroma. The 10.5 ounce will last a long time and provides the best value over the smaller sizes. I used this in Germany back in the 80&#x27;s and still love&#x27;n it</li>
            <li> My first use was in later 60&#x27;s when I was stationed in Germany.  I purchased the same name and product in 1966.  To this day I still have the same bottle with just a few drops left.  I don&#x27;t know if mine has aged, but it smells different than this new one I just received.  It does not have the deep smell of the original one I bought and I thought I was getting the same product. I don&#x27;t think I would purchase this product again as the original one was definitely a winner.  &amp;#34;If  it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it&amp;#34;. You lost a winner.</li>
            <li> Tabac Original is a great perfume/cologne/after shave lotion.  I find it very balanced and all time best choice for me.  It seems to have right mix of notes.  Some people may find it a bit classic.  I am glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell much like tobacco to me.</li>
            <li> I can not quite remember when I first used Tabac, but I&amp;#34;ll always remember the scent, especially hours after using. Great choice for an independent guy!</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t quite what I was expecting - not all that &amp;#34;tobaccoish&amp;#34;, really, and I get the &amp;#34;old person&amp;#34; comments as a 20-something guy. However, it&#x27;s a really interesting smell, and I really liked it, even though I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would wear it whilst trying to attract the fairer sex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d splash a little on during the day from time to time, and noticed that it was actually very subtle, sort of distinguished. Long story short, after a few weeks, I&#x27;m not sure if I could stomach going back to sickly-sweet designer stuff! It&#x27;s cologne I actually enjoy wearing for my own sake, which I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve ever been able to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, at this price, why not...</li>
            <li> This smells a lot like Old Spice Classic to me. I think it lasts longer though. I like that in an aftershave.</li>
            <li> This was such an excellent purchase...Which only added to my enjoyment of a scent for the ages masculine with just enough citrus to create that morning fresh fragrance...</li>
            <li> I have used Tabac since 1959. I use it daily, every morning before going to work. It is not too strong, but long lasting. I use the after shave also.  I have used Tabac exclusively over 50 years.  I lived in  South America for&lt;br /&gt;several years, and had trouble keeping a supply.  Tabac is the only cologne I use, and as long as I can get ot&lt;br /&gt;I will never change.</li>
            <li> I used to use this in the 1970&#x27;s and really loved the stuff.  This is the original from Germany and just as good as it used to be.  the delivery was one day early and I was very happy about that.  The size was surprising as it was much larger than I expected.  Definitely getting a great cologne at a great price and I will buy again from this seller!&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll read a few reviews that this is more a cologne for older men and at 60 I have to agree. I don&#x27;t see younger men wanting this even though when I was young it was fine regardless of age; that&#x27;s just how things change over time.  Now I&#x27;d have to say if you&#x27;re under 50 you might want to wait.  If you&#x27;re over 50 or closer to 60 you&#x27;ll really love this stuff if you never got a chance to wear it before. To me the smell is like a fresh powder leaving you smelling and feeling clean.  There&#x27;s different levels to it and all blend well throughout the day; but after describing all the various layer of scents they combine to result in fresh to me. Not strong or over powering but always there and never gets stale, stays the same all day long. For me it&#x27;s like an old friend that&#x27;s just right for me.  And I like the fact that it&#x27;s not a young guys scent of the moment or current fad; just clean, nice, subtle and...me. Hope that helps:)</li>
            <li> The fragrance is not quite like the original baack in the 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Personally, I would give it a -1, BUT, In all fairness, it did live up to the expectations of all the other reviewers who gave it a 5 (or 4). I was hoping it was a cologne that I used to use back in the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s called &amp;#34;Fleur de Tabac&amp;#34;. It wasn&#x27;t and the scent was just not for me. BUT the scent was EXACTLY as to what the other reviewers said (the ones who liked it.</li>
            <li> This is a product that my husband has used for at least 30 years. I had a relative in Germany who had purchased it and sent it to him from time to time.Loves it.</li>
            <li> Great cologne!  Got this as a gift in Denmark years ago, and can&#x27;t do without it. Not flowery, not too musky....... Very classy and comfortable at the same time.</li>
            <li> Hadn&#x27;t bought any Tabac for a long time, but always liked the fragrance.  Still had some in storage from a long time back.  When I got this newer product, something seemed to be missing, so I checked against the older product and my thought was confirmed.  It&#x27;s good, but just not as good as it used to be.  Maybe Maurer + Wirtz.had to leave something out to pass muster with FDA.</li>
            <li> I wore Tabac back in the &#x27;70s and didn&#x27;t realize that it was still available. Just purchased a bottle after all these years and it is still great. The scent is a little like a nice pipe tabacco.</li>
            <li> Quick ship. Recommend seller especially because they also have other great deals and low prices; not to mention the old fashioned smell that I enjoyed for a long, long time. Try it.</li>
            <li> Just as I remember Tabac from back in the 70&#x27;s.  So glad I was able to find that it was still available.</li>
            <li> I was glad when yet another bottle of my favorite cologne arrived. My use is orthodox: living in a rehab center, the refreshing fragrance dispels nasty smells when sprinkled on  the privacy curtain between the beds.</li>
            <li> Now I have to admit for being just shy of under $20 and getting 10.1oz of this cologne from Germany.White milk glass bottle and metal screw on cap.Nice little plug that covers the spicket so that none leaks.Speaking of the spicket it has a plastic insert so when you pour this out you shake it out.No, not a wide open mouth like you&#x27;d think spilling a bunch all over the place as one might expect.Now let&#x27;s get to the interesting part...Tabac&#x27;s scent...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tabac Original&#x27;s Scent:&lt;br /&gt;Someone&#x27;s probably asking &#x27;why would I recognize this scent&#x27;? a very good question.Frankly I don&#x27;t care how many ingredients are in a cologne the big picture is what you smell.To me this cologne has three notes:lemon,bergamot,and lavender.It&#x27;s really similar to Jovan Musk except you have to imagine replacing the orange in Jovan with the lemon.Another similar scent like Tabac aside from a few other notes to be more expansive...Vetiver by Guerlain.But Maurer &amp; Wirtz designed this scent character first so they&#x27;ve got dibs on originality.Tabac is very citrusy and soapy and bergamot does interesting things with lavender.Bergamot creates an old-fashioned richness and lends a smoky tail to that soap accord.My point being this cologne will do two things.You&#x27;ll be juggling the notion if you like this or Jovan Musk more.But as inexpensive as Tabac is it really ridicules a lot of dollar cost from Guerlain&#x27;s Vetiver scent.But between the three? definitely praising the Tabac Original more.The lemon makes it nicer,it&#x27;s cheap and plentiful in what you&#x27;ll recieve,and lasts throughout the work day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5-stars and highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I prefer wearing EdT&#x27;s but I dip into this EdC quite often, especially if I use Tabac Shave Soap, then their after shave...then I&#x27;ll finish with this EdC for the full Tabac treatment</li>
            <li> In 1966 a girlfriend gave me a gift of Tabac, I loved it as soon as I tried it. I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.</li>
            <li> I actually do the same with this stuff as another reviewer...I use it as aftershave and its nice, strong, clean, and actually makes me feel like I came out of a nice old style barber.  Not one of the $25 beauty salon garbage.</li>
            <li> MOSTLY EUROPEANS WILL TEND TO RECOGNIZE THE NAME. IT IS LIKE THE OLD SPICE OF THE UNITED STATES. DIFFERENT COLOGNE, ROBUST. NOT FOR SISSIES.&lt;br /&gt; THE PRICE, YOU CANNOT BEAT FOR THE QUANTITY.&lt;br /&gt;ANTHONY.H&lt;br /&gt;BURLINGTON, MA.</li>
            <li> Have used the product for over 30 yrs.&lt;br /&gt;Light, distictive, not over powering.&lt;br /&gt;one of the best colognes that I have used over the years.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and all Tabac products.  My wife thinks it is old man stink.  I still use it and don&#x27;t care.  Sometimes I want to smell like an old school gentleman.  However, it&#x27;s strong so use sparingly.</li>
            <li> Tabac is smooth but strong. It does not last that long for me. But, I paid $15 for two 300ml bottles.</li>
            <li> Its one of  my Dad&#x27;s favorite colognes but hard to find in retail stores.  He was so happy his face lit up when he opened his Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> A great old school masculine cologne. It was shipped quickly by Perfumania. At this price, it&#x27;s an outstanding buy. I like it so much, I&#x27;ve ordered some for my son.</li>
            <li> Great smell, like all Tabac products. I am very happy I got this. It is a rather LARGE bottle!!</li>
            <li> For my taste, and my wife&#x27;s, a superb choice in cologne.  A subtle, inoffensive scent, and the scent lingers through the day.</li>
            <li> This brawny cologne is amazing.  It smells fantastic and like nothing else on earth.  It is also very long lasting.  I think of this as a winter and an evening cologne because of its power.</li>
            <li> My husband ordered this and we both like it very much. Inexpensive and smells great! Heard about this scent from an older man, so wasn&#x27;t sure if we&#x27;d like it.</li>
            <li> Super to get this here in the USA. As a travel journalist I usually buy it in Germany. Too far to go when it runs out, so VG that I can now find and buy it in the USA. It&#x27;s super and a nifty aroma!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Clayton, jdcradio@cox.net</li>
            <li> I have been using this cologne since the 60&#x27;s.  Have gotten many compliments on it.  It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find though.  Glad I found it here.</li>
            <li> I have used Tabac by MAURER &amp; WIRTZ for more years than most of you have been alive.&lt;br /&gt;I do not know of any other place where I can purchase this product.&lt;br /&gt;The product is superb:  Unique -- and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> This cologne is not for everybody, as it has a very complex fragrance; like the smell of a hardwood forest after a rain shower. I think the entire line of Tabac products are incredible and this cologne is the perfect partner to their shaving soap.</li>
            <li> so classic man scent!</li>
            <li> I have been shaving for a very long time and this cologne is excellent at refreshing your skin afterwards, especially if you are sensitive to razor burn. This Tabac has a soothing and healing effect.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not over powering and very unique. Nevermind the negative reviews, go ahead and wear this scent with confidence. The bottle is also very large and will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I think I found my favourite scent. This fragrance is amazing. Not too overpowering, but at the same time it lingers pleasantly.</li>
            <li> This is just a pleasant, non overbearing, light and clean scent. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this cologne for teens- for this requires one to be a bit of a connoisseur...</li>
            <li> While this is a classic scent and is very masculine, I do NOT agree that it is a scent every man could wear. It is definitely geared for older gentleman. It definitely has a heavy powder note to the scent that is indicative of men in their 50s or older. Perhaps a gentleman in his 40s could wear this scent, but that&#x27;s as far as I would go. For anyone younger, I would recommend something a bit less powdery, a bit sweeter, but still as spicy, such as Havana.</li>
            <li> this scent is weird to me. To me its ok . after it settles down a bit . but not my favorite</li>
            <li> This french smelling cologne is very different from the status quo, definetly has a warm fragrance that changes with your body chemistry. I&#x27;ve been using this for years so when I ordered this product I was happy they did NOT tamper with the fragrance as they did, adding a citrussy tone to the Eau de toilette. spray. I&#x27;ve since appreciated the change to the edt spray, but still prefer the old fragrance Tabac Cologne, and you can&#x27;t beat the amount you get for the price.</li>
            <li> If this is how an old man is suppose to smell than I guess I am an old man!  I am 47 years old and to my nose this smells amazing! Like some reviewers here I use Tabac original cologne as an aftershave lotion.  The bottle is huge! How they produce this in Germany and sell this much at such a low cost is a mystery to me. This could well be the best fragrance deal on the net!</li>
