            <li> This smells so so good it&#x27;s was really worth the money! (:</li>
            <li> Smells great and was delivered earlier than expected :)</li>
            <li> It smells super good and it delivered fast, and the bottle was bigger than expected. I might just buy another one.</li>
            <li> So I just received the spray. It smells nothing like what I expected. Mind you, I have never smelled it before in the store. And the shipping was a bit long. It smells a little watered down, has a alcohol smell and nothing like passionfruit. Also when I got the spray the bottle was scorching hot while the box was cool.. Guess I&#x27;ll just wear it around the house.</li>
            <li> The original 4 were first introduced in 2014. This year they returned with mini perfumes and the scent Kauai they are all wonderful in my opinion and I have them all. I get all my stuff during the semi-annual sale. If you like one I am pretty sure that you will like all 5</li>
            <li> 1st time smelling this and I love it I&#x27;m so glad I bought it but like I always say it smells different on everybody but hey I love it!</li>
            <li> I just received Hawaii passionfruit kids fragrance a few days ago and I love it. It smells so good. I didn&#x27;t expect it to ship as fast as it did. I will definitely be getting some different Fragrances soon.</li>
            <li> Great seller and product!</li>
            <li> I always get so many people asking what I&#x27;m wearing when I use this body spray everyone seems to love it and so do I. It lasts a long time but it&#x27;s not overpowering and being told several times throughout the day that &amp;#34;you smell good&amp;#34; from perfect strangers doesn&#x27;t hurt either :)</li>
            <li> If you like Yves saint Laurent Babydoll, you will love this! Smells exactly like it, but much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I already had the body wash and lotion so I ordered the spray and it smells just as amazing! Love it!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the shipping was extremely fast.</li>
            <li> Sweet smelling and not too fancy adult smelling. It has a warm fragrance that I really like!</li>
            <li> I started wearing this to work, and I kept getting compliments on it. I even had one kid jokingly tell me to follow him around just so he could smell me. hahaha definitely worth the buy!</li>
