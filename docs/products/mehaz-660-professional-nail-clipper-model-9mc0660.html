            <li>Very good clippers.</li>
            <li>The quality and construction of the product seems to be very good.  </li>
            <li>The trimming catcher is just a bother, but the nail file that&#x27;s attached to the catcher is very good — so I peeled it off (it&#x27;s held in place with adhesive) and stuck it to the bottom of the trimmer itself.</li>
            <li>Great clippers, excellent cut and grip.</li>
            <li>Good purchase!</li>
            <li>finally a good nail clipper!</li>
            <li>The steel is in a beautiful brush finish&lt;br</li>
            <li>work great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with the quality of the metal cutter and plastic catcher both.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was a GREAT decision, and these clippers are like the Ferrari or Rolls Royce of nail clippers.</li>
            <li>I bought it because of the insanely great reviews.</li>
            <li>Thank you for a great price too</li>
            <li>Great clippers.  </li>
            <li>These are great clippers.</li>
            <li>The clipped nails don&#x27;t fly everywhere.  </li>
            <li>Want a great blade but also want that file for under the nails.</li>
            <li>I am that happy I did.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one fits all of my requirements so I am happy that I made the purchase.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, the nails fly out of the gap in the corner of the clipping catcher.  </li>
            <li>My nails have been so happy with me ever since I bought them.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy I picked these after some research.  </li>
            <li>They have a bullet proof construction and the built in fingernail clipper catch works great.</li>
            <li>Some people scoff at a good pair and settle for drugstore brands and others who have bought this one just don&#x27;t know a good thing when they hold it in their hands!  </li>
            <li>These are very nice clippers.</li>
            <li>Cuts very nicely.</li>
            <li>This nail trimmer cuts very nicely.</li>
            <li>Very nice product that I would recommend without exception.</li>
            <li>Best nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever used and it has a cover :)</li>
            <li>The clippers are excellent as many have noted.</li>
            <li>I love to read blogs on the very best of products.</li>
            <li>That was a pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li>Excellent nail clipper that is easy to use with either hand.  </li>
            <li>I bought these on a whim, and it was a good decision.</li>
            <li>These are really good clippers.</li>
            <li>No one should ever equate heaven with nail clippers, but they are that good.</li>
            <li>It has good build</li>
            <li>Good quality</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>good ergonomics.</li>
            <li>I have used it for months and am impressed at how silky smooth</li>
            <li>Buy a cheaper pair that work good.</li>
            <li>really good fingernail clipper.  </li>
            <li>The best clipper available.  </li>
            <li>I think it would do a good job</li>
            <li>The Good</li>
            <li>the good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>good quality.</li>
            <li>Good file on it,</li>
            <li>This is a good clipper, would recommend buying it.</li>
            <li>I get a good result, but as a guy it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;ve ever been used to.</li>
            <li>Who was the jerk who thought this was a good idea?</li>
            <li>These are exceptionally well made and competitively priced.</li>
            <li>Over all I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Most nails fly out.  </li>
            <li>I love these clippers!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Great product, awesome for adult fingernails, even better for babies and toddlers (warning: you must have ninja type controls).</li>
            <li>I went out and got cheap drugstore clippers and am quite happy.</li>
            <li>These clippers are amazing.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know a pair of nail clippers could actually be nice.</li>
            <li>Also, the plastic catcher part has a built-in nail file on the underside which is made of metal and is quite handy.</li>
            <li>how nicely you guide and cut your nail..</li>
            <li>This nail cutter is great, I love the satisfying click at the end of each press.</li>
            <li>These clippers are really nice.</li>
            <li>So nice</li>
            <li>A built-in file would be handy because I don&#x27;t carry one with me.</li>
            <li>so they don&#x27;t go flying all over the room, which is nice.  </li>
            <li>My husband is really anal with having his nails trimmed and was told this nail clipper would be the best</li>
            <li>This one is really the best.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent product for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It does have a nice nail file attached to the underside, so I cannot call it a loss, and slip it onto the clipper after I&#x27;m done using to store it.</li>
            <li>Nice feel and do their job. &#x27;</li>
            <li>I had a really nice manicure set for 45 years until one of my kids lost the nail clippers.</li>
            <li>The plastic-wrapped-around feature is quite nice to hold all the nail, but it sometimes gets in the way if I want to turn it to cut bits and bites.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Third, it&#x27;s perfect size for finger nails, but not so much for toe nails.  </li>
            <li>Nice clippers, &#x27;nuff said.  </li>
            <li>These are really nice.</li>
            <li>Nice quality of metal.  </li>
            <li>Clean cuts, great lever.</li>
            <li>It fits me perfectly and I am a normal height person.</li>
            <li>I love this because it is so easy to use, great for my hand size and very strong and durable.</li>
            <li>The nail clipper, aMehaz 660 purchased at Amazon, is as good as any on the market and better than most,  It is advertised as having a wider opening clipper</li>
            <li>The clippers have a nice weight in the hand, and the lever has a satisfying feel as it is pushed downward.</li>
            <li>This is a nice nail clipper, I love good quality tools and designs, believe me, the sound that this clipper makes every time you use it is awsome</li>
            <li>Smooth, good blade, lightweight.</li>
            <li>It is the best I owned so far.</li>
            <li>I had better luck with the Seki Edge Deluxe Toenail Clipper.  </li>
            <li>The clippers fit inside a plastic sleeve that catches the nail trimmings and includes an adhered file attachment that is great quality and has a fine grit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Mehaz is not bad but not that good.</li>
            <li>Also, they don&#x27;t have the mini-file available on most clippers - my fault for not noticing that, but what a miss!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>It is heavier than the MEHAZ and have a better finish.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great products.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re better off buying revlon.</li>
            <li>It was smaller than I thought, but it does its job perfectly.</li>
            <li>I got it more than one year and still love it.  </li>
            <li>Drugstore clippers work better.</li>
            <li>I really love this clipper.</li>
            <li>The sleeve is better than nothing though.</li>
            <li>you can spend much more, but why?</li>
            <li>LOVE these clippers and so glad I bought them.</li>
            <li>So pleased with this purchase/fast shipment/quality product, and I&#x27;m sure you would be too.    </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
            <li>This is simply the best nail clipper money can buy..</li>
            <li>These nail clippers are top rated on review sites.</li>
            <li>My wife and I decided to get some better clippers for a nicer nail-clipping experience.    </li>
            <li>I can now clip my finger nails more often without worrying about the clippings flying all over the places.  </li>
            <li>I gave this a three star rating instead of more stars in that it was offered on Amazon.com as a toenail clipper.  </li>
            <li>but for most people probably not.  </li>
            <li>The clipping catcher is also a great feature and works very well; I haven&#x27;t had any nail clippings flying away since using this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never owned any Shun or Zero Tolerance products, but all of my Kershaws are of top quality materials and construction.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>they cut even the most stubborn nails with ease.</li>
            <li>worthwhile purchase</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>A really top notch clipper:</li>
            <li>I could have done a better job with my cheapo clipper, or my teeth, or maybe a can opener.</li>
            <li>Like a surgical instrument these clippers work better than any that I have purchased before.</li>
            <li>Still, better than the stuff you get at the drugstore hence the 3 stars.</li>
            <li>Always felt that there&#x27;s got to be something better and something sharper.  </li>
            <li>Better for fingers than toenails.</li>
            <li>This is the best that I saw after extensive shopping.</li>
            <li>I love these nail clippers.  </li>
            <li>This is really a much better sharper and durable clipper I ever owned.</li>
            <li>They might cost a lot more than the 99 cent ones at Walgreens or CVS</li>
            <li>The nail catcher plastic part looks good and fits onto the metal clipper very nicely; it almost clicks into place in the front position so it doesn&#x27;t slide back when you don&#x27;t want it to.</li>
            <li>file is also a bit janky, a full sized file will be much more effective regardless of the application.</li>
            <li>These clippers cut precisely and are very easy to use.</li>
            <li>This clipper clips very cleanly</li>
            <li>I would guess they are normally pretty good</li>
            <li>and I even enjoy the task because it&#x27;s so easy!</li>
            <li>More about the design - the cut is as you would expect from a \\&quot;Made in Japan\\&quot; KAI device; it gives a precise, satisfying \\&quot;click\\&quot; as it cuts at the brittlest of nails.</li>
            <li>The quality (good solid build) is good.  </li>
            <li>Overall this was a good buy -- superior quality without an exorbitant price.</li>
            <li>These are the best nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever had, but I&#x27;ve only had cheap ones before.  </li>
            <li>Has a very smooth motion and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>but if you don&#x27;t mind taking 10 to 15 minutes more with filing it smoothly..</li>
            <li>The cheap nail clippers at the dollar store do a MUCH better job than my pair.</li>
            <li>Your nails don&#x27;t fly too far.</li>
            <li>Has a beautiful clear compartment to catch stray nails (which I enjoy).</li>
            <li>First off - this is by far the best nail clipper I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This is the straight version of the angled toenail clipper and I found after some work with the both clippers that this is a good combination.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nail cutter, how good can it really be.  </li>
            <li>Almost too good - you really have to pay attention when trying to cut your nails.  </li>
            <li>The Mehaz 660 really cuts easily and makes a good cut.</li>
            <li>A very smooth, clean cut without pulling or tearing.</li>
            <li>So sharp, cuts perfect every time.  </li>
            <li>For something you do routinely, you should have a tool that is easy to use and efficient.</li>
            <li>I never knew that finger nails could be trimmed as easily as these clippers make it.</li>
            <li>So even though they are made better than cheap, chrome drugstore alternatives, you will have to care for them -- that, I suppose, is an important life lesson</li>
            <li>Plastic nail catcher is in the way at times but is easy to remove.</li>
            <li>Easy to fix!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to clip nails.</li>
            <li>and I cut both my fingernails and toenails with these easily.  </li>
            <li>High quality - fair price</li>
            <li>Apart from that, they are quite sharp and do a great job of catching nails</li>
            <li>This is hands down, the best nail clipper I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>Greatest professional quality Clipper made in Germany with high quality steel.</li>
            <li>I can easily tell the difference when holding this one compared to the cheapy, cheap one I had before.</li>
            <li>It still cuts my nails fine</li>
            <li>My husband has arthritis in his thumbs, and needed a nail clipper design that was comfortable and easy to use clipping his nails.</li>
            <li>This good quality nail clipper is sharp and makes a good clean cut on finger nails.</li>
            <li>- Nice large nail file on the back.&lt;br /&gt; - Plastic nail catcher is useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy I got them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it was a fortunate mistake as these clippers are fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They cut nails precisely and neatly.</li>
            <li>I never thought about the quality of my nail clippers, but these are literally fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It is comfortable to hold and use.</li>
            <li>but I like the sound</li>
            <li>the problem I noticed was it doesn&#x27;t cut your nail smoothly..</li>
            <li>Well I read reviews of these nail clippers and some people experienced the same issues as I did before using these nail clippers.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll never use a cheap set again because you do get what you pay for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>looks great, and will likely stay sharper longer than the cheaper cutters.</li>
            <li>These are fantastic clippers for the money.  </li>
            <li>You can feel the quality in the metal and when you clip nails, as it just doesn&#x27;t feel like the cheap drug store clippers you get.</li>
            <li>Mine are not set correctly and they don&#x27;t make a smooth cut in my nails.</li>
            <li>These are fantastic.</li>
            <li>I learned that nail clippers need to be precise and sturdy for one to have control.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>My cheap ones were damaged when in my suitcase during travel</li>
            <li>Despite the price, these are cheap &amp; flimsy.</li>
            <li>Maybe not quite worth the price, but I sure do like how it cuts and smooths.</li>
            <li>Since then I tried all the locally available clippers without satisfaction.</li>
            <li>It does not make a smooth cut.  </li>
            <li>What looks like it might be a clean cut very quickly turns in to having to deal with all these snages and split layers.</li>
            <li>Over all, Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper is better made and cuts better.</li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW, what a difference a good set of nail clippers make.</li>
            <li>this is one of the products that are simply MUCH better than the cheap version that it is worth buying and using.</li>
            <li>Truly, they do clip more smoothly and easily than other clippers I have had, which were mostly the kind you&#x27;d find in a grocery store.</li>
            <li>This cutter cuts precisely and cleanly.  </li>
            <li>I feel like it ALWAYS makes smooth, clean cuts, never any tearing.</li>
            <li>Clippers are very easy to use and don&#x27;t require much pressure at all to clip fingernails.</li>
            <li>Nice high quality clippers.</li>
            <li>metal has a strange feeling but it works great.</li>
            <li>While they are better than cheap nail clippers, they are by no means an amazing product, and in my opinion, do not warrant such a price.  </li>
            <li>Cuts nail cleanly but I removed the plastic nail catcher because it got in the way.  </li>
            <li>it operates and leaves nails so cleanly cut no filing is required.</li>
            <li>Makes a clean clip.</li>
            <li>They do not cut cleanly; after clipping my nails are torn &amp; ripped.</li>
            <li>Clean cut, catches clippings.</li>
            <li>These have so many positive reviews for a reason.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this thinking that it is special since it was supposed to be &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to describe, but I will do my best.</li>
            <li>Much better than the normal cheap clippers from WalMart.</li>
            <li>Good enough for the price.</li>
            <li>so you&#x27;re not going to get a super clean cut.</li>
            <li>Thank you sweet home review.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad clipper but not finished as well nor cuts as well as my Feather Parada clipper which was made in Japan.</li>
            <li>It feels more solid, it moves smoothly, and it trims very, very well since the blades are very sharp and perfectly aligned.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I rarely submit reviews for amazon items as most current reviews are very accurate.</li>
            <li>high quality, cut as many nails as you want.</li>
            <li>feels pretty cheap to me.</li>
            <li>To this day, 20 years later, those clippers are still as good as new, they look brand new, they cut like magic and we all fight over it!</li>
            <li>It is a precision made clpper and very sharp, does a great job on my fingernails.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, at nearly half the price of the Seki Edge, I think that these KAI clippers are a great value.</li>
            <li>After all these great Amazon reviews, I took the plunge and pay double what I normally pay.  </li>
            <li>SUPER product, well worth</li>
            <li>they work so easy hold very well in hand</li>
            <li>could be so easy but with the Mehaz clippers your nails are clipped at the softest touch and the nail catcher works really well.</li>
            <li>Sharp, nicely aligned, very nice file on the back.</li>
            <li>I bought these on a recommendation from &amp;#34;The Sweet Home&amp;#34; website, and they are good, but not as sharp as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>It does it job but a little too great.</li>
            <li>These are worth every penny</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re worth every penny.</li>
            <li>in all, well worth the price.</li>
            <li>The only good thing about this purchased was that the stainless steel doesn&#x27;t rust even if you soaked it in liquid solution..</li>
            <li>They were nearly unusable with the plastic tray attached and performed just slightly better after removing it.</li>
            <li>Most the clippings are caught in the clear plastic housing.</li>
            <li>I have to take the plastic &amp;#34;nail catcher&amp;#34; off to use it, and after I clip I have to use the file (on the back of the plastic sheath) to make sure my nails are even and smooth.</li>
            <li>but they are worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>As a man who used the cheap clippers I found around the house from other people all my life, I finally decided to go get my own nice pair.</li>
            <li>It cuts cleanly and is long, and so, very easy to use.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a nicely made, precise, sharp, heavy-duty nail clipper.</li>
            <li>Cuts right every time and easier too.  </li>
            <li>Nice, clean cuts, but the plastic housing to catch the clippings is not very useful.</li>
            <li>My whole life I&#x27;ve used those cheap clippers you get from a bin on the counter of the drug store, and never even gave a thought to the existence of higher quality clippers.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve been using cheap supermarket nail clippers your whole life, you&#x27;ll find these pretty impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very large.</li>
            <li>It would be great if you could train your errant fingernails to properly place themselves into the little plastic sleeve that fits over the top...</li>
            <li>It works easily and is very sharp so cuts very easy.  </li>
            <li>It has excellent leverage so the cutting is easy.</li>
            <li>Best nail clipper (finger and toe) that I&#x27;ve used in recent memory, and I&#x27;m oddly picky about them.</li>
            <li>For this price, it really should do a little better job and be more ergonomically friendly.</li>
            <li>They operate extremely smooth and cut clean with no sharp edge like all of the others.  </li>
            <li>Have used quite a few other models, which have all been fine, but this model is the best.</li>
            <li>Would advise that the high price is well worth it!</li>
            <li>However, the clipper is great for someone that uses it daily or works in a nail salon that has to use it commercially.</li>
            <li>Well worth the extra bucks for a much better unit than you get in a drug store.</li>
            <li>These fit comfortably, are solidly constructed and work well.</li>
            <li>The clipper is sharp and cuts very cleanly and easily.</li>
            <li>body and lever are much larger than cheaper nail clippers, which makes this thing super easy to handle.</li>
            <li>Great tool functions as described, Performs clear cut and stays sharp much better quality than what one can find in a regular drugstore.</li>
            <li>First Years American Red Cross Deluxe Nail Clipper with Magnifier is also very good and is only $3 when Amazon sells</li>
            <li>They cost more than the standard clippers</li>
            <li>is my first experience with nail clippers that don&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t have an interest in using that function, and the clipper looks sleeker and better overall without it.</li>
            <li>This clipper does its job cleanly, better than any I have had from a drug store or Walmart type store in the last 60 years or so.  </li>
            <li>However they don&#x27;t leave a pretty shape</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I was amazed when I first used these clippers.</li>
            <li>There are a lot of better clips locally.</li>
            <li>These clippers do exactly what you&#x27;d expect, but what I appreciate is the size.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately not on my toenails.</li>
            <li>This is the first Professional Nail Clipper I&#x27;ve every purchased, and I&#x27;ve got to say I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying any cheap nail clippers for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li>I love when a product actually improves my life and makes it easier.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s better than a regular clipper.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s clippr jaw is similar to most models.</li>
            <li>I bought these because they stated the manufacturer was the same as Shun knives (which i love and own).&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, they just are not the quality i was looking for</li>
            <li>but as soon as I took my first clip I knew looks were deceiving.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very sharp and cut 10 times better than any of the cheap clippers ever did.</li>
            <li>The handle is easy to operate with low resistance, and not awkward.</li>
            <li>These nail clippers are super easy and super sharp.</li>
            <li>I have always been the person to purchase the cheap nail clippers at the pharmacy, but decided to spend a little more this time.</li>
            <li>Nice clippers but these things are way too sharp.</li>
            <li>Nice and sharp.</li>
            <li>Nice sharp clippers.</li>
            <li>is an excellent stainless steel clipper that retains a sharp edge and is small enough to put on a keychain for handy access.</li>
            <li>The ends come out not as smooth as I&#x27;d expect from a \\&quot;professional\\&quot; clipper, though I don&#x27;t really know what professional clippers are supposed to do.</li>
            <li>They are, however, very well made, and truly are better than standard clippers. - Gary</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Tried this and the Tweezerman, both highly recommended but this wins.</li>
            <li>Let me first say that this is a very high quality nail clipper.</li>
            <li>We agree with all the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this item based on all the positive reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This generally happens to cheap nail clippers that has no quality control.  </li>
            <li>I wish I knew about these a long time ago, because these are my favorite.  </li>
            <li>The feature that collects the clippings doesn&#x27;t really work consistently, but who cares?</li>
            <li>Clean cut, easy to use, sharp.</li>
            <li>The radius is pretty appropriate for both small and large fingers/thumbs and it works exceedingly well compared to cheap knock-off it replaced.</li>
            <li>Even without the file and the catcher, I wouldn&#x27;t mind paying upwards of $20 for these because I am sure they will continue to perform for a very long time.</li>
            <li>I wish I could easily remove (and replace) the plastic clipping catcher, but no such luck.</li>
            <li>Extremely sharp blades that are aligned exactly to the correct point - a very smooth operating lever and the nail catcher works.  </li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s a bit on the large side and not always snappy.</li>
            <li>Gives a clean cut with no rough edges.</li>
            <li>They are very high quality.</li>
            <li>The catcher really does work, and the wide handle makes clipping easy, we bought several more pairs after trying these.</li>
            <li>They need less strength in the hands to use, so they are very good for hands with arthritis (or some other weakness).</li>
            <li>Great clipper over all but a little too commercial for us.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super sharp, cuts smoothly.  </li>
            <li>This one is very sharp and clips very easily.  </li>
            <li>I am embarrassed but pleased to have spent this much money on a nail clipper.</li>
            <li>It cuts nails very poorly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When closed, you can visibly see the top and bottom of the nail clipper does not line up</li>
            <li>But they do what they do very well.</li>
            <li>I expected more from this nail clipper based on the price I paid.  </li>
            <li>When I clip my nails, the clippers does not clip the whole nail</li>
            <li>Absolutely.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;sideways\\&quot; though, not aligned straight with</li>
            <li>thing is it doesn&#x27;t have a feature I want, and it has an additional fixture that I really don&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>For now, they seem to work very well.</li>
            <li>I was very dissapointed in this product.  </li>
            <li>The blades don&#x27;t match up very well.  </li>
            <li>More often than not fingernails are just crushed or torn rather than clipped.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping and reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s stamped KAI, Stainless Steel, Made in Japan.</li>
            <li>If there is a trick to it, I don&#x27;t know it, and really, I don&#x27;t have time for tricks when trimming my nails.</li>
            <li>- These clippers cut very well.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;d recommend these for anyone who does not like cheap drugstore nail clippers.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t just chop off a whole nail at one go.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;catcher&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t really catch anything.</li>
            <li>Work really well.</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t really do anything.&lt;br</li>
            <li>really easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Big improvement over the cheap ones I used over the years.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these clippers for both felines and humans!</li>
            <li>The only con to this product that I could find is that I washed these clippers in some warm water and dawn dish soap and the bottom of the clipper rusted a tiny bit.</li>
            <li>Weight, it has a nice heavy feel to it</li>
            <li>The look and feel of the clippers is great (nice size/weight, comfortable &amp; sturdy), but they simply do a terrible job of clipping nails!</li>
            <li>Very precise and sharp.  </li>
            <li>Sharp, precise, smooth cutting performance, with almost effortless action makes this a best buy for me.</li>
            <li>Awsome price, super sharp, makes clean cuts, and the plastic cover helps prevent nails from flying anywhere.</li>
            <li>functionality is also reasonably good and sharp enough head.........</li>
            <li>Much better than other drug store clippers.</li>
            <li>plastic catch has small side cutouts to allow larger nails to fit in the clipper, while still catching the clippings.</li>
            <li>And, the curve of the topside handle was positioned all wrong; it was as if they just slapped the curve on the handle anywhere that seemed good but didn&#x27;t test it out!</li>
            <li>very good a little disappointed with the nail catcher but as a nail clipper is pretty good</li>
            <li>Looks good, starts off working well, but dulls easily and loses pressure, soon can&#x27;t cut tougher nails anymore.</li>
            <li>I am happy to say that these were worth the extra money and effortlessly cut through his thick toe nails!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Clippers are made from high quality stainless steel and can be dipped in disinfectant liquid without rusting.</li>
            <li>These really are high end clippers.  </li>
            <li>Previously had used clippers purchased at the big box stores and thought that was as good as it got, until I tried these.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also has a small file on the bottom, handy if you don&#x27;t need a fulll file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sharp, and has an ergonomic shape for better grip.</li>
            <li>I could have purchased a nail clipper for half the price that would have done a better job.  </li>
            <li>First things first, these are actually KAI clippers which have seemingly been cross-branded as \\&quot;MEHAZ\\&quot; for distribution purposes.</li>
            <li>I mainly used it to dig gunk from out under my noenails.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that they do leave the fingernails just a bit ragged in places, but this is quickly touched up by a nail file.</li>
            <li>All materials are high quality as well</li>
            <li>Seem to be high quality.</li>
            <li>They are highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>This is a high quality product with one exception.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>These clippers work very well--they are comfortable and sharp.</li>
            <li>Because they are so sharp and easy to hold, my cat never wiggles around and doesn&#x27;t mind having her nails cut.</li>
            <li>The clipper looked like a strong, sharp nail clipper...</li>
            <li>The plastic sleeve which appears to be there to catch &amp;#34;clippings&amp;#34; is completely in the way and makes these clippers very cumbersome to use.  </li>
            <li>The way to describe the &amp;#34;clarity&amp;#34; of the clipping action on this clipper is that it is very crispy.</li>
            <li>so you must file your nails afterwards and is somewhat narrow requiring more cuts per each nail that I would like.</li>
            <li>no duh).  </li>
            <li>I normally buy just a drug store nail clipper.  </li>
            <li>Most of the clippings are caught in the clear rubber sleeve and the few that aren&#x27;t just fall straight</li>
            <li>I have normal nail thickness</li>
            <li>They are good, not great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not hard to remove, but I just leave it on since it does not get in the way.</li>
            <li>Finally a nail clipper that actually cuts easily</li>
            <li>This thing is sick, best pair of nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>I was willing to pay a little more for clippers that would last a lifetime.  </li>
            <li>They are very sharp and leave a nice clean edge with very little effort.</li>
            <li>Sharp, accurate -</li>
            <li>Have had them for five months, and they have a resounding \\&quot;cling\\&quot; sound, sharp blades, and no rust.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t manipulate this pair or fit them where I want them to cut, so the corners of my nails are unclipped and sharp.</li>
            <li>Right out of the box, they are sharp and cut crisp even lines.</li>
            <li>well, it is brand new.  </li>
            <li>and I immediately ordered a new set as I have not found any that match in quality as these.</li>
            <li>Live and learn.</li>
            <li>Seriously, the most minor pressure rips a gorgeous line through your wimpy nails and you&#x27;re left wondering why you ever paid the same price for a crappy pair of Revlon ones at Target.  </li>
            <li>very sharp easy to use.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very easy to handle, very sharp, cuts smoothly &amp; quietly.</li>
            <li>doesnt hold many clippings so it needs to be empty OFTEN sometimes multiple times during one usage.</li>
            <li>Very old people have a problem operating these things because they don&#x27;t have the strength in their fingers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a half dozen other models and these are far superior.</li>
            <li>Make no mistake, however, that KAI actually manufactures these (KAI, as you may be aware, is the parent company of the high-end Shun knife brand).</li>
            <li>The extra cost of manufacturing in Japan is evident when these clippers are in your hand.</li>
            <li>(I actually did this for the first 2 years of college).</li>
            <li>The first nail clipper I owned that actually works the way one would expect.</li>
            <li>Same as any other clippers but better quality.</li>
            <li>I have some arthritis in my hands and this is the first clippers I have found in forever that actually cuts where I want it to cut.   </li>
            <li>A winner so far!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your time on the cheap clippers, spend a couple extra dollars and put a smile on your face.</li>
            <li>I ordered these since the generic clippers that you can buy at the store were never sharp or strong enough to get through my husband&#x27;s toe nails.</li>
            <li>Clips nails easily with little effort.  </li>
            <li>You can definitely see the quality construction in the product, and you can feel it with the smooth clipping action and click of the perfectly aligned very sharp cutting surfaces.</li>
            <li>These are about perfect in every way - the only exception being it&#x27;s a bit difficult to cut the big toe nail since these have the smaller size clippers instead of the full, standard size (if you know what I&#x27;m talking about).  </li>
            <li>My practical side resisted spending this much money on nail clippers, but the other reviews are right.</li>
            <li>However, the holster is easily removed; it takes about 1 second or even less if you are particularly nimble.</li>
            <li>The nail clipper is not strong enough to cut my toe nails without a lot more effort than normal.  </li>
            <li>Its very hard to find good clippers these days, but this is definitely a find.</li>
            <li>It is super sharp, slicing through nails like butter, or something.</li>
            <li>The clippers are super sharp but the plastic case gets in the way on the curved side portion of the nail.</li>
            <li>Super sharp.  </li>
            <li>you are looking for the BEST nail clipper, because you&#x27;re tired of clipping your nails with dull, rusted clippers, try this MEHAZ 660 professional nail Clipper.  </li>
            <li>Works great, does the job of cutting my nails.</li>
            <li>I wish Amazon provided clear details of where a product was made in their product description.</li>
            <li>Also, these are made in Japan, just like you would expect from any KAI cutlery (they are marked \\&quot;Made in Japan\\&quot; all over).</li>
            <li>Also, the holster has a steel nail file on the underside, and like the clippers, is marked \\&quot;KAI Made in Japan\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Well they do cut nails and so far they cut them well.  </li>
            <li>Too narrow to fit my nails</li>
            <li>I only regret not investing in this clipper much sooner.</li>
            <li>Try this MEHAZ 660 professional nail</li>
            <li>I have used several clippers in my life and you can really tell the difference with these clippers.  </li>
            <li>I used to buy drugstore clippers and would race after a shower or a nail soak to cut my nails while they were still soft</li>
            <li>I wish they would give up on the nail catcher though and put a fold out fingernail cleaner and nail file on the device; or just leave them off completely.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t put it next to water, because it tends to rust, even if it says that is stainless steel.</li>
            <li>MEHAZ 660 Professional Nail Clipper (Model: 9MC0660)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe I didn&#x27;t completely read the description, but I do not remember if the description had the size or not?  </li>
            <li>The packaging the product comes in is by far the stupidest packaging in the world.</li>
            <li>Their great at cutting nails period!I love them plain and simple!</li>
            <li>very small, did not cut my nails was more like breaking them.</li>
            <li>Having read such glowing reviews, I expected a true quality nail clipper - this is not the case.  </li>
            <li>As previously mentioned, the two cutting edges do not meet perfectly</li>
            <li>/&gt;The #660 is a smaller size (the size of normal nail clippers) and is for your fingernails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different nail cutters many of which resulted in sharp and uncomfortable nails.  </li>
            <li>and I doubt these new ones would have become damaged in the same situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The entire device is made of brushed stainless steel (lever, body, and fulcrum)</li>
            <li>Very simply, it doesn&#x27;t split my very soft fingernails.</li>
            <li>Not sharp and breaks nails.</li>
            <li>These things are sharp, and produce crisp cuts on my finger and toenails.</li>
            <li>Much higher quality than my other clippers.</li>
            <li>It cuts cleanly and takes very little pressure.  </li>
            <li>They are sharp and sleek...and the rough finish, there by design, helps to hold them securely.  </li>
            <li>The shape of the blades (thick and straight) make this cutter very hard to use and get a good result...  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll never go back to the cheap drug-store clippers you usually use.</li>
            <li>All over, they are marked with \\&quot;KAI\\&quot;, the same logo that you&#x27;ll find on your Shun knives.</li>
            <li>Further, the plastic catch directs nail clippings in between the blades near their fusion resulting in clippings that cannot be dislodged from the set.</li>
            <li>My old nail clipper is being called back to work.  </li>
            <li>It also makes a double click noise when you release, blades snapping back to normal position.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The metal is also thick and solid, which makes me believe these will last for many years.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a little dull and it kind of takes ragged bites off of your fingernails?  </li>
            <li>I have had others that leave a smooth edge when they cut, but this one leaves the nail a little rough.</li>
            <li>The blades are so sharp that it cuts clean with very minimal effort.  </li>
            <li>The case can be removed, but it&#x27;s normally on pretty tight, so some effort is needed to remove it.</li>
            <li>The top and bottom cutting edges were slanted too much inward and the gap between them was too small/narrow,</li>
            <li>Not only can they easily cut through your nails, they can take out a few layers of skin if you are not too careful.</li>
            <li>The upper handle is very smooth and since it opens so wide it is somewhat hard to hold and control.  </li>
            <li>You can put it in your junk drawer and it&#x27;ll wear much slower than an average grocery store clipper</li>
            <li>These clippers are still, in the scheme of things, cheap, but are sharp, ergonomic, heavy duty, and even look nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(they are a Japanese cutlery manufacturer, MEHAZ is apparently the sub-brand).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This model is also very narrow so better fit for someone with small hands such as a child or small lady.  </li>
            <li>These clippers are very sharp and cut very well.</li>
            <li>These clippers cut nails cleanly and with little effort because they are sharp.</li>
            <li>I bought this nail clipper with high expectations based on other reviewers’ experience.  </li>
            <li>, it is not annoying as usually with other nail clippers.</li>
            <li>I could not find the Bell clippers from Korea online anywhere, so I decided to go with this pair since it got good reviews and the price wasn&#x27;t too bad</li>
            <li>To be honest, I haven&#x27;t had much luck with the catcher, but I may just be stupid.</li>
            <li>Well crafted, solid feel and amazing precision in cutting.  </li>
            <li>I would however wish there was a model available that was at least 1\\&quot; wide to cover the entire toenail, although I might have missed this model at Amazon.</li>

            <li> Very good clippers.</li>
            <li> The quality and construction of the product seems to be very good.  </li>
            <li> The trimming catcher is just a bother, but the nail file that&#x27;s attached to the catcher is very good — so I peeled it off (it&#x27;s held in place with adhesive) and stuck it to the bottom of the trimmer itself.</li>
            <li> Great clippers, excellent cut and grip.</li>
            <li> Good purchase!</li>
            <li> finally a good nail clipper!</li>
            <li> The steel is in a beautiful brush finish&lt;br</li>
            <li> work great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with the quality of the metal cutter and plastic catcher both.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was a GREAT decision, and these clippers are like the Ferrari or Rolls Royce of nail clippers.</li>
            <li> I bought it because of the insanely great reviews.</li>
            <li> Thank you for a great price too</li>
            <li> Great clippers.  </li>
            <li> These are great clippers.</li>
            <li> The clipped nails don&#x27;t fly everywhere.  </li>
            <li> Want a great blade but also want that file for under the nails.</li>
            <li> I am that happy I did.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one fits all of my requirements so I am happy that I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, the nails fly out of the gap in the corner of the clipping catcher.  </li>
            <li> My nails have been so happy with me ever since I bought them.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy I picked these after some research.  </li>
            <li> They have a bullet proof construction and the built in fingernail clipper catch works great.</li>
            <li> Some people scoff at a good pair and settle for drugstore brands and others who have bought this one just don&#x27;t know a good thing when they hold it in their hands!  </li>
            <li> These are very nice clippers.</li>
            <li> Cuts very nicely.</li>
            <li> This nail trimmer cuts very nicely.</li>
            <li> Very nice product that I would recommend without exception.</li>
            <li> Best nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever used and it has a cover :)</li>
            <li> The clippers are excellent as many have noted.</li>
            <li> I love to read blogs on the very best of products.</li>
            <li> That was a pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li> Excellent nail clipper that is easy to use with either hand.  </li>
            <li> I bought these on a whim, and it was a good decision.</li>
            <li> These are really good clippers.</li>
            <li> No one should ever equate heaven with nail clippers, but they are that good.</li>
            <li> It has good build</li>
            <li> Good quality</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> good ergonomics.</li>
            <li> I have used it for months and am impressed at how silky smooth</li>
            <li> Buy a cheaper pair that work good.</li>
            <li> really good fingernail clipper.  </li>
            <li> The best clipper available.  </li>
            <li> I think it would do a good job</li>
            <li> The Good</li>
            <li> the good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> good quality.</li>
            <li> Good file on it,</li>
            <li> This is a good clipper, would recommend buying it.</li>
            <li> I get a good result, but as a guy it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;ve ever been used to.</li>
            <li> Who was the jerk who thought this was a good idea?</li>
            <li> These are exceptionally well made and competitively priced.</li>
            <li> Over all I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Most nails fly out.  </li>
            <li> I love these clippers!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product, awesome for adult fingernails, even better for babies and toddlers (warning: you must have ninja type controls).</li>
            <li> I went out and got cheap drugstore clippers and am quite happy.</li>
            <li> These clippers are amazing.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know a pair of nail clippers could actually be nice.</li>
            <li> Also, the plastic catcher part has a built-in nail file on the underside which is made of metal and is quite handy.</li>
            <li> how nicely you guide and cut your nail..</li>
            <li> This nail cutter is great, I love the satisfying click at the end of each press.</li>
            <li> These clippers are really nice.</li>
            <li> So nice</li>
            <li> A built-in file would be handy because I don&#x27;t carry one with me.</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t go flying all over the room, which is nice.  </li>
            <li> My husband is really anal with having his nails trimmed and was told this nail clipper would be the best</li>
            <li> This one is really the best.  </li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It does have a nice nail file attached to the underside, so I cannot call it a loss, and slip it onto the clipper after I&#x27;m done using to store it.</li>
            <li> Nice feel and do their job. &#x27;</li>
            <li> I had a really nice manicure set for 45 years until one of my kids lost the nail clippers.</li>
            <li> The plastic-wrapped-around feature is quite nice to hold all the nail, but it sometimes gets in the way if I want to turn it to cut bits and bites.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Third, it&#x27;s perfect size for finger nails, but not so much for toe nails.  </li>
            <li> Nice clippers, &#x27;nuff said.  </li>
            <li> These are really nice.</li>
            <li> Nice quality of metal.  </li>
            <li> Clean cuts, great lever.</li>
            <li> It fits me perfectly and I am a normal height person.</li>
            <li> I love this because it is so easy to use, great for my hand size and very strong and durable.</li>
            <li> The nail clipper, aMehaz 660 purchased at Amazon, is as good as any on the market and better than most,  It is advertised as having a wider opening clipper</li>
            <li> The clippers have a nice weight in the hand, and the lever has a satisfying feel as it is pushed downward.</li>
            <li> This is a nice nail clipper, I love good quality tools and designs, believe me, the sound that this clipper makes every time you use it is awsome</li>
            <li> Smooth, good blade, lightweight.</li>
            <li> It is the best I owned so far.</li>
            <li> I had better luck with the Seki Edge Deluxe Toenail Clipper.  </li>
            <li> The clippers fit inside a plastic sleeve that catches the nail trimmings and includes an adhered file attachment that is great quality and has a fine grit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Mehaz is not bad but not that good.</li>
            <li> Also, they don&#x27;t have the mini-file available on most clippers - my fault for not noticing that, but what a miss!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> It is heavier than the MEHAZ and have a better finish.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the great products.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re better off buying revlon.</li>
            <li> It was smaller than I thought, but it does its job perfectly.</li>
            <li> I got it more than one year and still love it.  </li>
            <li> Drugstore clippers work better.</li>
            <li> I really love this clipper.</li>
            <li> The sleeve is better than nothing though.</li>
            <li> you can spend much more, but why?</li>
            <li> LOVE these clippers and so glad I bought them.</li>
            <li> So pleased with this purchase/fast shipment/quality product, and I&#x27;m sure you would be too.    </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is simply the best nail clipper money can buy..</li>
            <li> These nail clippers are top rated on review sites.</li>
            <li> My wife and I decided to get some better clippers for a nicer nail-clipping experience.    </li>
            <li> I can now clip my finger nails more often without worrying about the clippings flying all over the places.  </li>
            <li> I gave this a three star rating instead of more stars in that it was offered on Amazon.com as a toenail clipper.  </li>
            <li> but for most people probably not.  </li>
            <li> The clipping catcher is also a great feature and works very well; I haven&#x27;t had any nail clippings flying away since using this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned any Shun or Zero Tolerance products, but all of my Kershaws are of top quality materials and construction.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> they cut even the most stubborn nails with ease.</li>
            <li> worthwhile purchase</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> A really top notch clipper:</li>
            <li> I could have done a better job with my cheapo clipper, or my teeth, or maybe a can opener.</li>
            <li> Like a surgical instrument these clippers work better than any that I have purchased before.</li>
            <li> Still, better than the stuff you get at the drugstore hence the 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Always felt that there&#x27;s got to be something better and something sharper.  </li>
            <li> Better for fingers than toenails.</li>
            <li> This is the best that I saw after extensive shopping.</li>
            <li> I love these nail clippers.  </li>
            <li> This is really a much better sharper and durable clipper I ever owned.</li>
            <li> They might cost a lot more than the 99 cent ones at Walgreens or CVS</li>
            <li> The nail catcher plastic part looks good and fits onto the metal clipper very nicely; it almost clicks into place in the front position so it doesn&#x27;t slide back when you don&#x27;t want it to.</li>
            <li> file is also a bit janky, a full sized file will be much more effective regardless of the application.</li>
            <li> These clippers cut precisely and are very easy to use.</li>
            <li> This clipper clips very cleanly</li>
            <li> I would guess they are normally pretty good</li>
            <li> and I even enjoy the task because it&#x27;s so easy!</li>
            <li> More about the design - the cut is as you would expect from a \\&quot;Made in Japan\\&quot; KAI device; it gives a precise, satisfying \\&quot;click\\&quot; as it cuts at the brittlest of nails.</li>
            <li> The quality (good solid build) is good.  </li>
            <li> Overall this was a good buy -- superior quality without an exorbitant price.</li>
            <li> These are the best nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever had, but I&#x27;ve only had cheap ones before.  </li>
            <li> Has a very smooth motion and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> but if you don&#x27;t mind taking 10 to 15 minutes more with filing it smoothly..</li>
            <li> The cheap nail clippers at the dollar store do a MUCH better job than my pair.</li>
            <li> Your nails don&#x27;t fly too far.</li>
            <li> Has a beautiful clear compartment to catch stray nails (which I enjoy).</li>
            <li> First off - this is by far the best nail clipper I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This is the straight version of the angled toenail clipper and I found after some work with the both clippers that this is a good combination.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nail cutter, how good can it really be.  </li>
            <li> Almost too good - you really have to pay attention when trying to cut your nails.  </li>
            <li> The Mehaz 660 really cuts easily and makes a good cut.</li>
            <li> A very smooth, clean cut without pulling or tearing.</li>
            <li> So sharp, cuts perfect every time.  </li>
            <li> For something you do routinely, you should have a tool that is easy to use and efficient.</li>
            <li> I never knew that finger nails could be trimmed as easily as these clippers make it.</li>
            <li> So even though they are made better than cheap, chrome drugstore alternatives, you will have to care for them -- that, I suppose, is an important life lesson</li>
            <li> Plastic nail catcher is in the way at times but is easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Easy to fix!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to clip nails.</li>
            <li> and I cut both my fingernails and toenails with these easily.  </li>
            <li> High quality - fair price</li>
            <li> Apart from that, they are quite sharp and do a great job of catching nails</li>
            <li> This is hands down, the best nail clipper I have ever had.  </li>
            <li> Greatest professional quality Clipper made in Germany with high quality steel.</li>
            <li> I can easily tell the difference when holding this one compared to the cheapy, cheap one I had before.</li>
            <li> It still cuts my nails fine</li>
            <li> My husband has arthritis in his thumbs, and needed a nail clipper design that was comfortable and easy to use clipping his nails.</li>
            <li> This good quality nail clipper is sharp and makes a good clean cut on finger nails.</li>
            <li> - Nice large nail file on the back.&lt;br /&gt; - Plastic nail catcher is useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m happy I got them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it was a fortunate mistake as these clippers are fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They cut nails precisely and neatly.</li>
            <li> I never thought about the quality of my nail clippers, but these are literally fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It is comfortable to hold and use.</li>
            <li> but I like the sound</li>
            <li> the problem I noticed was it doesn&#x27;t cut your nail smoothly..</li>
            <li> Well I read reviews of these nail clippers and some people experienced the same issues as I did before using these nail clippers.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll never use a cheap set again because you do get what you pay for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> looks great, and will likely stay sharper longer than the cheaper cutters.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic clippers for the money.  </li>
            <li> You can feel the quality in the metal and when you clip nails, as it just doesn&#x27;t feel like the cheap drug store clippers you get.</li>
            <li> Mine are not set correctly and they don&#x27;t make a smooth cut in my nails.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic.</li>
            <li> I learned that nail clippers need to be precise and sturdy for one to have control.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> My cheap ones were damaged when in my suitcase during travel</li>
            <li> Despite the price, these are cheap &amp; flimsy.</li>
            <li> Maybe not quite worth the price, but I sure do like how it cuts and smooths.</li>
            <li> Since then I tried all the locally available clippers without satisfaction.</li>
            <li> It does not make a smooth cut.  </li>
            <li> What looks like it might be a clean cut very quickly turns in to having to deal with all these snages and split layers.</li>
            <li> Over all, Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper is better made and cuts better.</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW, what a difference a good set of nail clippers make.</li>
            <li> this is one of the products that are simply MUCH better than the cheap version that it is worth buying and using.</li>
            <li> Truly, they do clip more smoothly and easily than other clippers I have had, which were mostly the kind you&#x27;d find in a grocery store.</li>
            <li> This cutter cuts precisely and cleanly.  </li>
            <li> I feel like it ALWAYS makes smooth, clean cuts, never any tearing.</li>
            <li> Clippers are very easy to use and don&#x27;t require much pressure at all to clip fingernails.</li>
            <li> Nice high quality clippers.</li>
            <li> metal has a strange feeling but it works great.</li>
            <li> While they are better than cheap nail clippers, they are by no means an amazing product, and in my opinion, do not warrant such a price.  </li>
            <li> Cuts nail cleanly but I removed the plastic nail catcher because it got in the way.  </li>
            <li> it operates and leaves nails so cleanly cut no filing is required.</li>
            <li> Makes a clean clip.</li>
            <li> They do not cut cleanly; after clipping my nails are torn &amp; ripped.</li>
            <li> Clean cut, catches clippings.</li>
            <li> These have so many positive reviews for a reason.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this thinking that it is special since it was supposed to be &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe, but I will do my best.</li>
            <li> Much better than the normal cheap clippers from WalMart.</li>
            <li> Good enough for the price.</li>
            <li> so you&#x27;re not going to get a super clean cut.</li>
            <li> Thank you sweet home review.  </li>
            <li> Not a bad clipper but not finished as well nor cuts as well as my Feather Parada clipper which was made in Japan.</li>
            <li> It feels more solid, it moves smoothly, and it trims very, very well since the blades are very sharp and perfectly aligned.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I rarely submit reviews for amazon items as most current reviews are very accurate.</li>
            <li> high quality, cut as many nails as you want.</li>
            <li> feels pretty cheap to me.</li>
            <li> To this day, 20 years later, those clippers are still as good as new, they look brand new, they cut like magic and we all fight over it!</li>
            <li> It is a precision made clpper and very sharp, does a great job on my fingernails.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, at nearly half the price of the Seki Edge, I think that these KAI clippers are a great value.</li>
            <li> After all these great Amazon reviews, I took the plunge and pay double what I normally pay.  </li>
            <li> SUPER product, well worth</li>
            <li> they work so easy hold very well in hand</li>
            <li> could be so easy but with the Mehaz clippers your nails are clipped at the softest touch and the nail catcher works really well.</li>
            <li> Sharp, nicely aligned, very nice file on the back.</li>
            <li> I bought these on a recommendation from &amp;#34;The Sweet Home&amp;#34; website, and they are good, but not as sharp as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> It does it job but a little too great.</li>
            <li> These are worth every penny</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re worth every penny.</li>
            <li> in all, well worth the price.</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this purchased was that the stainless steel doesn&#x27;t rust even if you soaked it in liquid solution..</li>
            <li> They were nearly unusable with the plastic tray attached and performed just slightly better after removing it.</li>
            <li> Most the clippings are caught in the clear plastic housing.</li>
            <li> I have to take the plastic &amp;#34;nail catcher&amp;#34; off to use it, and after I clip I have to use the file (on the back of the plastic sheath) to make sure my nails are even and smooth.</li>
            <li> but they are worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> As a man who used the cheap clippers I found around the house from other people all my life, I finally decided to go get my own nice pair.</li>
            <li> It cuts cleanly and is long, and so, very easy to use.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a nicely made, precise, sharp, heavy-duty nail clipper.</li>
            <li> Cuts right every time and easier too.  </li>
            <li> Nice, clean cuts, but the plastic housing to catch the clippings is not very useful.</li>
            <li> My whole life I&#x27;ve used those cheap clippers you get from a bin on the counter of the drug store, and never even gave a thought to the existence of higher quality clippers.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve been using cheap supermarket nail clippers your whole life, you&#x27;ll find these pretty impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very large.</li>
            <li> It would be great if you could train your errant fingernails to properly place themselves into the little plastic sleeve that fits over the top...</li>
            <li> It works easily and is very sharp so cuts very easy.  </li>
            <li> It has excellent leverage so the cutting is easy.</li>
            <li> Best nail clipper (finger and toe) that I&#x27;ve used in recent memory, and I&#x27;m oddly picky about them.</li>
            <li> For this price, it really should do a little better job and be more ergonomically friendly.</li>
            <li> They operate extremely smooth and cut clean with no sharp edge like all of the others.  </li>
            <li> Have used quite a few other models, which have all been fine, but this model is the best.</li>
            <li> Would advise that the high price is well worth it!</li>
            <li> However, the clipper is great for someone that uses it daily or works in a nail salon that has to use it commercially.</li>
            <li> Well worth the extra bucks for a much better unit than you get in a drug store.</li>
            <li> These fit comfortably, are solidly constructed and work well.</li>
            <li> The clipper is sharp and cuts very cleanly and easily.</li>
            <li> body and lever are much larger than cheaper nail clippers, which makes this thing super easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Great tool functions as described, Performs clear cut and stays sharp much better quality than what one can find in a regular drugstore.</li>
            <li> First Years American Red Cross Deluxe Nail Clipper with Magnifier is also very good and is only $3 when Amazon sells</li>
            <li> They cost more than the standard clippers</li>
            <li> is my first experience with nail clippers that don&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t have an interest in using that function, and the clipper looks sleeker and better overall without it.</li>
            <li> This clipper does its job cleanly, better than any I have had from a drug store or Walmart type store in the last 60 years or so.  </li>
            <li> However they don&#x27;t leave a pretty shape</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed when I first used these clippers.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of better clips locally.</li>
            <li> These clippers do exactly what you&#x27;d expect, but what I appreciate is the size.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately not on my toenails.</li>
            <li> This is the first Professional Nail Clipper I&#x27;ve every purchased, and I&#x27;ve got to say I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying any cheap nail clippers for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> I love when a product actually improves my life and makes it easier.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s better than a regular clipper.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s clippr jaw is similar to most models.</li>
            <li> I bought these because they stated the manufacturer was the same as Shun knives (which i love and own).&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, they just are not the quality i was looking for</li>
            <li> but as soon as I took my first clip I knew looks were deceiving.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very sharp and cut 10 times better than any of the cheap clippers ever did.</li>
            <li> The handle is easy to operate with low resistance, and not awkward.</li>
            <li> These nail clippers are super easy and super sharp.</li>
            <li> I have always been the person to purchase the cheap nail clippers at the pharmacy, but decided to spend a little more this time.</li>
            <li> Nice clippers but these things are way too sharp.</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp.</li>
            <li> Nice sharp clippers.</li>
            <li> is an excellent stainless steel clipper that retains a sharp edge and is small enough to put on a keychain for handy access.</li>
            <li> The ends come out not as smooth as I&#x27;d expect from a \\&quot;professional\\&quot; clipper, though I don&#x27;t really know what professional clippers are supposed to do.</li>
            <li> They are, however, very well made, and truly are better than standard clippers. - Gary</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Tried this and the Tweezerman, both highly recommended but this wins.</li>
            <li> Let me first say that this is a very high quality nail clipper.</li>
            <li> We agree with all the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this item based on all the positive reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This generally happens to cheap nail clippers that has no quality control.  </li>
            <li> I wish I knew about these a long time ago, because these are my favorite.  </li>
            <li> The feature that collects the clippings doesn&#x27;t really work consistently, but who cares?</li>
            <li> Clean cut, easy to use, sharp.</li>
            <li> The radius is pretty appropriate for both small and large fingers/thumbs and it works exceedingly well compared to cheap knock-off it replaced.</li>
            <li> Even without the file and the catcher, I wouldn&#x27;t mind paying upwards of $20 for these because I am sure they will continue to perform for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I wish I could easily remove (and replace) the plastic clipping catcher, but no such luck.</li>
            <li> Extremely sharp blades that are aligned exactly to the correct point - a very smooth operating lever and the nail catcher works.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s a bit on the large side and not always snappy.</li>
            <li> Gives a clean cut with no rough edges.</li>
            <li> They are very high quality.</li>
            <li> The catcher really does work, and the wide handle makes clipping easy, we bought several more pairs after trying these.</li>
            <li> They need less strength in the hands to use, so they are very good for hands with arthritis (or some other weakness).</li>
            <li> Great clipper over all but a little too commercial for us.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super sharp, cuts smoothly.  </li>
            <li> This one is very sharp and clips very easily.  </li>
            <li> I am embarrassed but pleased to have spent this much money on a nail clipper.</li>
            <li> It cuts nails very poorly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When closed, you can visibly see the top and bottom of the nail clipper does not line up</li>
            <li> But they do what they do very well.</li>
            <li> I expected more from this nail clipper based on the price I paid.  </li>
            <li> When I clip my nails, the clippers does not clip the whole nail</li>
            <li> Absolutely.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;sideways\\&quot; though, not aligned straight with</li>
            <li> thing is it doesn&#x27;t have a feature I want, and it has an additional fixture that I really don&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> For now, they seem to work very well.</li>
            <li> I was very dissapointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> The blades don&#x27;t match up very well.  </li>
            <li> More often than not fingernails are just crushed or torn rather than clipped.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping and reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stamped KAI, Stainless Steel, Made in Japan.</li>
            <li> If there is a trick to it, I don&#x27;t know it, and really, I don&#x27;t have time for tricks when trimming my nails.</li>
            <li> - These clippers cut very well.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;d recommend these for anyone who does not like cheap drugstore nail clippers.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t just chop off a whole nail at one go.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;catcher&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t really catch anything.</li>
            <li> Work really well.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t really do anything.&lt;br</li>
            <li> really easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Big improvement over the cheap ones I used over the years.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these clippers for both felines and humans!</li>
            <li> The only con to this product that I could find is that I washed these clippers in some warm water and dawn dish soap and the bottom of the clipper rusted a tiny bit.</li>
            <li> Weight, it has a nice heavy feel to it</li>
            <li> The look and feel of the clippers is great (nice size/weight, comfortable &amp; sturdy), but they simply do a terrible job of clipping nails!</li>
            <li> Very precise and sharp.  </li>
            <li> Sharp, precise, smooth cutting performance, with almost effortless action makes this a best buy for me.</li>
            <li> Awsome price, super sharp, makes clean cuts, and the plastic cover helps prevent nails from flying anywhere.</li>
            <li> functionality is also reasonably good and sharp enough head.........</li>
            <li> Much better than other drug store clippers.</li>
            <li> plastic catch has small side cutouts to allow larger nails to fit in the clipper, while still catching the clippings.</li>
            <li> And, the curve of the topside handle was positioned all wrong; it was as if they just slapped the curve on the handle anywhere that seemed good but didn&#x27;t test it out!</li>
            <li> very good a little disappointed with the nail catcher but as a nail clipper is pretty good</li>
            <li> Looks good, starts off working well, but dulls easily and loses pressure, soon can&#x27;t cut tougher nails anymore.</li>
            <li> I am happy to say that these were worth the extra money and effortlessly cut through his thick toe nails!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Clippers are made from high quality stainless steel and can be dipped in disinfectant liquid without rusting.</li>
            <li> These really are high end clippers.  </li>
            <li> Previously had used clippers purchased at the big box stores and thought that was as good as it got, until I tried these.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also has a small file on the bottom, handy if you don&#x27;t need a fulll file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sharp, and has an ergonomic shape for better grip.</li>
            <li> I could have purchased a nail clipper for half the price that would have done a better job.  </li>
            <li> First things first, these are actually KAI clippers which have seemingly been cross-branded as \\&quot;MEHAZ\\&quot; for distribution purposes.</li>
            <li> I mainly used it to dig gunk from out under my noenails.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that they do leave the fingernails just a bit ragged in places, but this is quickly touched up by a nail file.</li>
            <li> All materials are high quality as well</li>
            <li> Seem to be high quality.</li>
            <li> They are highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> This is a high quality product with one exception.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> These clippers work very well--they are comfortable and sharp.</li>
            <li> Because they are so sharp and easy to hold, my cat never wiggles around and doesn&#x27;t mind having her nails cut.</li>
            <li> The clipper looked like a strong, sharp nail clipper...</li>
            <li> The plastic sleeve which appears to be there to catch &amp;#34;clippings&amp;#34; is completely in the way and makes these clippers very cumbersome to use.  </li>
            <li> The way to describe the &amp;#34;clarity&amp;#34; of the clipping action on this clipper is that it is very crispy.</li>
            <li> so you must file your nails afterwards and is somewhat narrow requiring more cuts per each nail that I would like.</li>
            <li> no duh).  </li>
            <li> I normally buy just a drug store nail clipper.  </li>
            <li> Most of the clippings are caught in the clear rubber sleeve and the few that aren&#x27;t just fall straight</li>
            <li> I have normal nail thickness</li>
            <li> They are good, not great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hard to remove, but I just leave it on since it does not get in the way.</li>
            <li> Finally a nail clipper that actually cuts easily</li>
            <li> This thing is sick, best pair of nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> I was willing to pay a little more for clippers that would last a lifetime.  </li>
            <li> They are very sharp and leave a nice clean edge with very little effort.</li>
            <li> Sharp, accurate -</li>
            <li> Have had them for five months, and they have a resounding \\&quot;cling\\&quot; sound, sharp blades, and no rust.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t manipulate this pair or fit them where I want them to cut, so the corners of my nails are unclipped and sharp.</li>
            <li> Right out of the box, they are sharp and cut crisp even lines.</li>
            <li> well, it is brand new.  </li>
            <li> and I immediately ordered a new set as I have not found any that match in quality as these.</li>
            <li> Live and learn.</li>
            <li> Seriously, the most minor pressure rips a gorgeous line through your wimpy nails and you&#x27;re left wondering why you ever paid the same price for a crappy pair of Revlon ones at Target.  </li>
            <li> very sharp easy to use.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very easy to handle, very sharp, cuts smoothly &amp; quietly.</li>
            <li> doesnt hold many clippings so it needs to be empty OFTEN sometimes multiple times during one usage.</li>
            <li> Very old people have a problem operating these things because they don&#x27;t have the strength in their fingers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a half dozen other models and these are far superior.</li>
            <li> Make no mistake, however, that KAI actually manufactures these (KAI, as you may be aware, is the parent company of the high-end Shun knife brand).</li>
            <li> The extra cost of manufacturing in Japan is evident when these clippers are in your hand.</li>
            <li> (I actually did this for the first 2 years of college).</li>
            <li> The first nail clipper I owned that actually works the way one would expect.</li>
            <li> Same as any other clippers but better quality.</li>
            <li> I have some arthritis in my hands and this is the first clippers I have found in forever that actually cuts where I want it to cut.   </li>
            <li> A winner so far!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time on the cheap clippers, spend a couple extra dollars and put a smile on your face.</li>
            <li> I ordered these since the generic clippers that you can buy at the store were never sharp or strong enough to get through my husband&#x27;s toe nails.</li>
            <li> Clips nails easily with little effort.  </li>
            <li> You can definitely see the quality construction in the product, and you can feel it with the smooth clipping action and click of the perfectly aligned very sharp cutting surfaces.</li>
            <li> These are about perfect in every way - the only exception being it&#x27;s a bit difficult to cut the big toe nail since these have the smaller size clippers instead of the full, standard size (if you know what I&#x27;m talking about).  </li>
            <li> My practical side resisted spending this much money on nail clippers, but the other reviews are right.</li>
            <li> However, the holster is easily removed; it takes about 1 second or even less if you are particularly nimble.</li>
            <li> The nail clipper is not strong enough to cut my toe nails without a lot more effort than normal.  </li>
            <li> Its very hard to find good clippers these days, but this is definitely a find.</li>
            <li> It is super sharp, slicing through nails like butter, or something.</li>
            <li> The clippers are super sharp but the plastic case gets in the way on the curved side portion of the nail.</li>
            <li> Super sharp.  </li>
            <li> you are looking for the BEST nail clipper, because you&#x27;re tired of clipping your nails with dull, rusted clippers, try this MEHAZ 660 professional nail Clipper.  </li>
            <li> Works great, does the job of cutting my nails.</li>
            <li> I wish Amazon provided clear details of where a product was made in their product description.</li>
            <li> Also, these are made in Japan, just like you would expect from any KAI cutlery (they are marked \\&quot;Made in Japan\\&quot; all over).</li>
            <li> Also, the holster has a steel nail file on the underside, and like the clippers, is marked \\&quot;KAI Made in Japan\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Well they do cut nails and so far they cut them well.  </li>
            <li> Too narrow to fit my nails</li>
            <li> I only regret not investing in this clipper much sooner.</li>
            <li> Try this MEHAZ 660 professional nail</li>
            <li> I have used several clippers in my life and you can really tell the difference with these clippers.  </li>
            <li> I used to buy drugstore clippers and would race after a shower or a nail soak to cut my nails while they were still soft</li>
            <li> I wish they would give up on the nail catcher though and put a fold out fingernail cleaner and nail file on the device; or just leave them off completely.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put it next to water, because it tends to rust, even if it says that is stainless steel.</li>
            <li> MEHAZ 660 Professional Nail Clipper (Model: 9MC0660)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t completely read the description, but I do not remember if the description had the size or not?  </li>
            <li> The packaging the product comes in is by far the stupidest packaging in the world.</li>
            <li> Their great at cutting nails period!I love them plain and simple!</li>
            <li> very small, did not cut my nails was more like breaking them.</li>
            <li> Having read such glowing reviews, I expected a true quality nail clipper - this is not the case.  </li>
            <li> As previously mentioned, the two cutting edges do not meet perfectly</li>
            <li> /&gt;The #660 is a smaller size (the size of normal nail clippers) and is for your fingernails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different nail cutters many of which resulted in sharp and uncomfortable nails.  </li>
            <li> and I doubt these new ones would have become damaged in the same situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The entire device is made of brushed stainless steel (lever, body, and fulcrum)</li>
            <li> Very simply, it doesn&#x27;t split my very soft fingernails.</li>
            <li> Not sharp and breaks nails.</li>
            <li> These things are sharp, and produce crisp cuts on my finger and toenails.</li>
            <li> Much higher quality than my other clippers.</li>
            <li> It cuts cleanly and takes very little pressure.  </li>
            <li> They are sharp and sleek...and the rough finish, there by design, helps to hold them securely.  </li>
            <li> The shape of the blades (thick and straight) make this cutter very hard to use and get a good result...  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll never go back to the cheap drug-store clippers you usually use.</li>
            <li> All over, they are marked with \\&quot;KAI\\&quot;, the same logo that you&#x27;ll find on your Shun knives.</li>
            <li> Further, the plastic catch directs nail clippings in between the blades near their fusion resulting in clippings that cannot be dislodged from the set.</li>
            <li> My old nail clipper is being called back to work.  </li>
            <li> It also makes a double click noise when you release, blades snapping back to normal position.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The metal is also thick and solid, which makes me believe these will last for many years.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a little dull and it kind of takes ragged bites off of your fingernails?  </li>
            <li> I have had others that leave a smooth edge when they cut, but this one leaves the nail a little rough.</li>
            <li> The blades are so sharp that it cuts clean with very minimal effort.  </li>
            <li> The case can be removed, but it&#x27;s normally on pretty tight, so some effort is needed to remove it.</li>
            <li> The top and bottom cutting edges were slanted too much inward and the gap between them was too small/narrow,</li>
            <li> Not only can they easily cut through your nails, they can take out a few layers of skin if you are not too careful.</li>
            <li> The upper handle is very smooth and since it opens so wide it is somewhat hard to hold and control.  </li>
            <li> You can put it in your junk drawer and it&#x27;ll wear much slower than an average grocery store clipper</li>
            <li> These clippers are still, in the scheme of things, cheap, but are sharp, ergonomic, heavy duty, and even look nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (they are a Japanese cutlery manufacturer, MEHAZ is apparently the sub-brand).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This model is also very narrow so better fit for someone with small hands such as a child or small lady.  </li>
            <li> These clippers are very sharp and cut very well.</li>
            <li> These clippers cut nails cleanly and with little effort because they are sharp.</li>
            <li> I bought this nail clipper with high expectations based on other reviewers’ experience.  </li>
            <li> , it is not annoying as usually with other nail clippers.</li>
            <li> I could not find the Bell clippers from Korea online anywhere, so I decided to go with this pair since it got good reviews and the price wasn&#x27;t too bad</li>
            <li> To be honest, I haven&#x27;t had much luck with the catcher, but I may just be stupid.</li>
            <li> Well crafted, solid feel and amazing precision in cutting.  </li>
            <li> I would however wish there was a model available that was at least 1\\&quot; wide to cover the entire toenail, although I might have missed this model at Amazon.</li>
            <li> My old clippers sometimes would not cut all the way through the nail but these ones seem pretty sharp and they require very little effort to use.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> I hope they stay this sharp for a while, but I can&#x27;t imagine them ever getting as dull as the cheap drugstore ones I used to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had and currently have a much better one that is wider at the cutting point (easier to use/fine tuned cuts) and leaves no sharp edges.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t open far enough for clipping the average toenail.  </li>
            <li> Extremely sharp and so far they&#x27;ve held that edge.  </li>
            <li> Much sharper and better cutting than the average nail clipper.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of crazy how this minor thing keeps bugging me.</li>
            <li> I gave this a 5 only because I have not used them for long, but will update later.</li>
            <li> There is no other way the handle, when closed, will stay aligned with the clipper.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the main reason I bought the nail clipper was for the nail catcher, and sadly the holder is only large enough to hold the tiniest of clippings.</li>
            <li> I bought two sets of clippers locally and one would barely cut through and would leave hangnails, and the other would sort of &amp;#34;crunch&amp;#34; and leave an edge on the nail.  </li>
            <li> Plus the plastic housing retains the nail, keeping it from throwing clipped fingernail pieces all over the room, which has always been something that would gross me out, although in a minor way.</li>
            <li> I am not a huge fan of the sheath, as it&#x27;s rather loose on the clippers, but it does not seem to get in the way much.</li>
            <li> For three months I&#x27;ve used this clipper for regular personal hygiene and to cut loose threads from cloths.</li>
            <li> The clipped nail retainer is useless, but easy to remove and throw away.</li>
            <li> I think that the extra length gives you a bit more leverage in bringing together the cutting edges.</li>
            <li> Expected these to be the Quality of the Japanese brand KAI, but was not the same.</li>
            <li> therefore I have to spend a lot of time trying to keep my nails looking decent and usually they jus</li>
            <li> They worked very well compared to the dull cutters you will find in a brick and mortar store.</li>
            <li> I like to cut several times per nail anyway for a smoother result, so I don&#x27;t really care if the cutting edge can&#x27;t cover my whole nail at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lose one point for the look/design, kind of ugly.</li>
            <li> It does not catch all the clippings, and if you chance to tip it for a more advantageous cutting angle, it will dump all or some of the already caught clippings.&lt;br</li>
            <li> At least, I can push it back far enough to use the clips on hang nails.</li>
            <li> Not worth the extra money over a standard clipper.</li>
            <li> I have not owned these clippers for long, so I cannot comment about the longetivity of the blades on the clipper.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say about nail clippers since they really only have one function</li>
            <li> Time will tell how these hold up in the long run.</li>
            <li> considering I intend to use it for a long, long time.</li>
            <li> The teeth are slightly larger (taller) than I&#x27;m used to which is harder to get under the nail.</li>
            <li> Should have had it long ago.</li>
            <li> and this is the ONLY clipper I&#x27;ve found that cuts the nail with minimal effort and contains the clippings well in the plastic catch tray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional nail clipper.</li>
            <li> My previous nail clippers were cheap drugstore clippers that were acceptable, but not great.  </li>
            <li> As a result, the lever works as a spring and flattens so much to the point of touching the “base”, so to speak, on the other side, when pressed.  </li>
            <li> So I suggest getting a strong pair of scissors or some other cutting implement to carefully open the package.  </li>
            <li> cutter is 7/16&amp;#34; wide and the clipper length is 2 5/8 long.  </li>
            <li> Every time I used these clippers my thumb constantly slid down that sloped handle, and I would lose my grip on the clippers while trying to cut my nails.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, but the file fell off after only two uses.</li>
            <li> prevent cutting easily</li>
            <li> It could be that this clipper is just too small and there&#x27;s not enough leverage to cut properly.</li>
            <li> They are the small/medium size typical nail clippers (not the big ones you use for toes).</li>
            <li> The blades come down vertically, which leaves a flat part that your finger needs to push against to get to the blade.</li>
            <li> Some people already file after cutting their nails so this so that&#x27;s fine for them, but it was an added step for</li>
            <li> The only qualm I have with the cutting action is the lever does not come to a complete stop when pushed down, but rather the assembly of the clipper allows the lever to be pushed further downward with additional force.</li>
            <li> If you have thick toenails, this clipper will make cutting them a lot easier and with far better results than pliers type cutters or the typical toenail clippers do.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to spend the extra money on these vs the cheaper drug store clippers</li>
            <li> Amazing, I was a bit skeptical to pay so much for clippers, but I was shocked at what a difference it makes.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it does not cut properly; it always leaves my nails very blunt.</li>
            <li> The clipper arrived on time and was what I expected.</li>
            <li> You can get them wet too, and they won&#x27;t rust.</li>
            <li> Slightly rough finish.</li>
            <li> Rough feeling when opening and twisting handle.</li>
            <li> end product is rough no matter</li>
            <li> I recommend the clippers - just be careful opening the package.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE!!!&lt;br /&gt;They seem to have lost their bite and it seems harder to get them to cut after about 6 months of ownership.</li>
            <li> However they don&#x27;t cut like I expected.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t cut through the nail, leave the nail rough, they break, and for years I had no idea</li>
            <li> Absolutely no complaints about the instrument.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now it takes only a few minutes</li>
            <li> Not a real difference maker compared to the ones you can pick up for a $1 at any drug store.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stay closed well.</li>
            <li> the Mehaz wide jaw slant edge clipper instead</li>
            <li> somehow it leaves one side of my nails rough</li>
            <li> Lastly, I like the keychain hole at the end -- allows me to attach it with my keys and reduces the chance of losing them (which was what happened to my previous clipper!).</li>
            <li> I tried to realign the blades but it is impossible as the upper blade moves back and forth, depending on how much pressure is put on the clipper to cut.</li>
            <li> Sharp clean cutting edge.  </li>
            <li> &gt; - Leaves nails sharp after cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Other Mehaz clippers say made in Japan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This clipper is extremely sharp and well made.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and sharp.</li>
            <li> other issue is the toenail clip catcher thing.</li>
            <li> These are amazingly sharp and I no longer even need to file my nails because they no longer catch on things.</li>
            <li> and I would go with other options.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found them to cut easier and cleaner than other &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; clipper brands like Tweezerman and Seki.</li>
            <li> AND THEY ARE AS SHARP AS</li>
            <li> No more foot work where the clipper just can&#x27;t cut through that big toe growth!!!  </li>
            <li> the “blade-lever” is relatively longer than usual and way, but way too flexible and flimsy.  </li>
            <li> Clippers are sharp and substantial as advertised.</li>
            <li> The nail clipping catcher is pretty much useless</li>
            <li> The longer lever combined with sharp blades makes it cut</li>
            <li> I found it unwieldly and overly sharp.  </li>
            <li> Sounds like an oxy-moron - a cutter that is too sharp?  </li>
            <li> Not made in Japan, as some of the other reviewers mentioned, made in Vietnam</li>
            <li> Sharp and seems durable</li>
            <li> They are extremely sharp and cut even the thickest nails to include toe nails.</li>
            <li> Extremely sharp.</li>
            <li> You have to be very careful or you will take a chunk of flesh off without knowing it.  </li>
            <li> The MEHAZ 660 Professional Nail definitely cuts well, but unfortunately that doesn&#x27;t transfer to it&#x27;s use...  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe I got clipped; however, if they DO open farther than standard toe-nail clippers, it is by a very small amount, probably not easily measureable.</li>
            <li> It really only works to catch small finger-nail clippings, as toenails will come off in large chunks in front, never really falling back into the clipper (perhaps this depends in your cutting style though, whether you clip all at once or take small cuts).</li>
            <li> This results in all cut edges to be angled sharply, producing very sharp nails.</li>
            <li> really not worth the money, plastic on the side</li>
            <li> It is not worth the price</li>
            <li> Not worth the premium.</li>
            <li> My nails have honestly never felt so nice after cutting them!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this clipper; it doesn&#x27;t have a wide enough opening to cut thick</li>
            <li> That means there is a bit less control over how much exactly you&#x27;re cutting, so if you&#x27;re obsessive about your nails lining up it will be harder to achieve precision.</li>
            <li> I found it hard to angle round the mail and the cut was extremely sharp and left edges.</li>
            <li> and it comes down to whether they can cut nails or not.  </li>
            <li> These are hands down the sharpest  clippers I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> there were other options!</li>
            <li> As anyone who&#x27;s familiar with cutlery knows, high-end consumer cutting devices usually come from Germany or Japan.</li>
            <li> The plastic case has a small nail file attached on the bottom, but I found the case of limited use.</li>
            <li> but it leaves very sharp edges</li>
            <li> These clippers are very sharp and cut well.  </li>
            <li> Very, VERY sharp.  </li>
            <li> Very Sharp.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp, well made (not made in China...</li>
            <li> These nail clippers leave my nails very sharp.</li>
            <li> Very sharp clippers, get the job done.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for nail cutters made in Japan like a pair of Kai Samurai clippers I had previously used.</li>
            <li> I have found that about half of them go in and half of them go whatever direction</li>
            <li> Also, this is nearly half the price of the Seki, and I just cannot see how a nail clipper could improve in anyway.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit longer than the typical drug store nail clipper, about 1 cm longer.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the description said it was better than the usual nail clipper but was disappointed to find out that it&#x27;s just like all the rest.</li>
            <li> Other clippers pale in comparison to the quality of this one</li>
            <li> I was looking for one that is sharp enough for tough nails and made well.  </li>
            <li> I bought this nail clipper thinking it would be better because of the high end price tag and the brand name as being professional, but I was very wrong and very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have a neuromuscular disease that causes weakness in my hands and cutting my nails was not the easiest task--now it is thanks to these nail clippers!  </li>
            <li> nail file is also built into this cover, which makes it pretty awkward to use.</li>
            <li> A little bulky for trimming in tight spots.</li>
            <li> It cuts cleanly, no doubt about that.</li>
            <li> A little bit pricey</li>
            <li> The lack of that little file that spins out is why I didn&#x27;t give it 5stars.</li>
            <li> I just took the little sleeve off.</li>
            <li> This requires each nail to be cut in little sections in sequence.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the price!</li>
            <li> With all honesty, however, after being frustrated with the quality of this clipper, I impose myself to take the time to warn other potential buyers about a major design flaw in this product:</li>
            <li> Finally, these clippers are a bit less expensive than the other well-reviewed clippers on Amazon (the Seki Edge ones).</li>
            <li> Hinge and materials are sturdy heavy material.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not great for keeping on a key ring and putting in your pocket.</li>
            <li> I thought this one would finally be the answer for me, but, alas, it is not.  </li>
            <li> cutting tip is not large, but I have not had any problem with it so far.</li>
            <li> very sharp with an audible click !</li>
            <li> The plastic catch has a narrow opening that makes it difficult to get nails into the gap, yet is wide enough to allow many clippings to pop out; the worst of both worlds.</li>
            <li> Particularly the cutting surface is too small for a man&#x27;s fingers.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and quit using those cheapie half dull ones you can get for a dollar.</li>
            <li> When open it is wide, makes holding it awkward.  </li>
            <li> It took very little effort to trim my nails which were way longer than they should have been for a man.</li>
            <li> Few burrs on your nails so hardly need a nail file to finish trim.  </li>
            <li> The clipper also has a small hole on the rear of the body (presumably for lanyards or something like that).</li>
            <li> Will buy to use for small gifts.</li>
            <li> , the picture makes it seem as though the handle is in an awkward position, pointing too far up.</li>
            <li> but its better then my husband leaving nasty nail clippings all over</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t seem to find a small clipper to take care of those.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to tear or otherwise cut the cardboard to get the bubble open.</li>
            <li> The ends are especially sharp.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to replace these with ordinary clippers.</li>
            <li> I would call them unforgiving and arbitrary--we all know how difficult such people are.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 6&#x27;5, and I often find health and beauty tools too small for my hands.</li>
            <li> No more having to sweep up nails from the floor.</li>
            <li> that the clippers are relatively small which makes them easier to travel with</li>
            <li> The others would try to mash through; getting the nail trimmed was an unbelievable efffort.</li>
            <li> I ordered these nail clippers based on reviews and was pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit too small for the toe</li>
            <li> No sharper no more efficient in anyway.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this nail clipper, I had no idea how small it was.  </li>
            <li> The clippers come inside a \\&quot;card\\&quot; consisting of stiff cardboard and a hard plastic bubble.</li>
            <li> cutting edge of the clippers does not fit easily underneath thicker toenails, making it almost impossible to clip these nails.</li>
            <li> I have waited a whole year to review this product since I received it, and overall I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> , the weird part I had to get use to, the flat face above/below the blades.</li>
            <li> Ineffective: the clipper was very difficult to maneuver, and when I finally got it where it needed to be, the cutting process left my nails jagged and sharp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell the size and type from the pictures alone.</li>
            <li> Because of the plastic nail covering, it is hard to clip the end of the nail.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had this almost a year now and it has not rusted or become dull.  </li>
            <li> I removed the plastic &amp;#34;nail catcher&amp;#34; because it makes it hard to see what you are doing.  </li>
            <li> but I found it hard to get used to since it affects how close you can get to your finger.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to keep a grip.</li>
            <li> Hard to use.</li>
            <li> The file is dull and inset from the edge of the plastic, making it hard to get under nails or into the corners.</li>
            <li> I did not find it annoying, and even though it \\&quot;got in the way\\&quot; a couple of times, I&#x27;m fairly certain this is just a matter of technique and getting used to this way of targeting the nail.</li>
            <li> have tried to justify the price somehow, but have reverted back to using my old nail clipper as this one is horrible.</li>
            <li> This means that clumsy or brutish people who exert a lot of force on these might put excess stress on the fulcrum of the device, which might wear it out over time.     </li>
            <li> Clumsy design.</li>
            <li> Goes through the big toe nail like it was cutting a piece of paper.  </li>
            <li> However the actual cutting edge on mine do not match up at all</li>
            <li> Also thought the giant handle would be awkward to use, not</li>
            <li> and I get a secondary click when I cut.  </li>
            <li> My toe nails are really thick.  </li>
            <li> Bought this product to cut fingernails but it is to thick to get under my nails.</li>
            <li> Requires very little effort on even your thickest nails (toe!).</li>
            <li> Small for woman&#x27;s finger nails!</li>
            <li> what I mean is it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Very sharp nail clipper; however, the sides of the blades are too sharp making it very difficult to slide the clipper along your nail.  </li>
            <li> No more jagged edges!  </li>
            <li> The plastic nail catchers on the sides make it a little difficult to use.</li>
            <li> It gives your nail a sharp finish after cutting.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; like with cheaper clippers, that&#x27;s because these are so sharp they are actually cutting through the nail instead of basically breaking it.</li>
            <li> The nail catcher kinda gets in the way of cutting sometimes but it still cuts effortlessly and without leaving a sharp edge.</li>
            <li> : They have a really sharp blade, and cutting is effortless.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One thing they did have going for them was the AMAZINGLY sharp cutting edges.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that the clipper was much smaller than it appeared on the pictures.</li>
            <li> How anyone could negatively review them is mind boggling!  </li>
            <li> The blade width is very narrow with too deep a curve and the design makes it very difficult to get the cutting blade under the edge of a nail.</li>
            <li> Very hard to maneuver around my fingers.</li>
            <li> very sharp cutting blades, easier on my nails.</li>
            <li> Wirecutter recommended this as the &amp;#34;best nail clippers.&amp;#34;  I was very skeptical since the price seems a little ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> These clippers performed noticeably worse than the cheapest Rite-Aid set of clippers.</li>
            <li> If you have thin toenails</li>
            <li> that the nail clippings do not fly everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Appreciate</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with these at all.</li>
            <li> Some corners are sharp for no reason, nothing too bad.  </li>
            <li> The clipper clips like cutting into butter but a little too scary for his taste.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before my cutting routine would take me at least 15 minutes</li>
            <li> it would have bee five stars if not for the unnecessary useless nail catcher attached.</li>
            <li> It was small!!!  </li>
            <li> I hesitated to give five stars to this product because it&#x27;s fingernail clippers and it seemed wrong, somehow, to give five stars to fingernail clippers.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the offset blades make clipping difficult as the nail edge is often pushed out between the blades rather than clipped.</li>
            <li> These are perhaps the worst nail clippers I have ever had the displeasure of using, and the price serves only to add insult to noxious experience.</li>
            <li> The clippings catcher is basically useless though, I just pulled it off and threw it away.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed with these nail clippers at all.  </li>
            <li> , I know it sounds weird</li>
            <li> save your money and buy this and never have to buy another sad clipper.</li>
            <li> Makes it difficult to use</li>
            <li> a silly addition</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got several dozen $1.99 Wal Mart nail clippers, and they are all terrible.</li>
            <li> Totally useless.</li>
            <li> Tired of the 99 cent clippers that bend your nails instead of cutting them.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who is fed up with trimming nails with mediocre &amp;#34;promotional giveaway&amp;#34; clippers - do yourself and nails a favor and grab one of these treasures.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with these.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are very poor toenail</li>
            <li> cutting head is curved, not straight.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cutting edges don&#x27;t line up and it moves out of alignment when you put pressure on it to cut nails(think of it as an \\&quot;overbite\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> The blades just breaks off the nails instead of cutting it.</li>
            <li> I was set on returning these, but when I looked at the cutting surface through the packaging and noticed the sharpness, I decided to try them out.</li>
            <li> However, the plastic cover is so awkward that it makes the clippers almost unusable.  </li>
            <li> The clipper width also makes them awkward to use.  </li>
            <li> After owning these for a few months, I think I can say these clippers are one of the worst.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, they are bulkier at the cutting edge.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does catch some of the clippings, but it hinders the use of the corners of the cutting edge.</li>
            <li> The handle angle is awkward too...</li>
            <li> Make nail cutting a pleasure.</li>
            <li> Also, I find it awkward to use with the plastic casing, so I have removed it.  </li>
            <li> impossible to see where you&#x27;re cutting</li>
            <li> Bad</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, the bad stuff.</li>
            <li> both issues making it very difficult to get the blades around the fingernail for cutting!  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed from day one.  </li>
            <li> and so they are worthless for the purpose of a nail clipper.  </li>
            <li> This caused a lot of frustration and anxiety over potentially cutting myself.&lt;br /&gt;Since thiis awful tool was bought couple of years ago, perhaps they have improved by now?</li>
            <li> Often with this product “the belly” of my pressing fingers got hurt as the lever squeezed them in its way to the base.  </li>
            <li> I hate these nail clippers.</li>
            <li> so I lived with this annoying</li>
            <li> Without the casing, there is no file attached to the clipper, but the file it comes with is annoying anyway.  </li>
            <li> However, I had to let everyone know what a piece of junk this clipper is, worst than $2 drug store clippers.  </li>
            <li> Truly awful product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought two sets of clippers locally and one would barely cut through and would leave hangnails, and the other would sort of &amp;#34;crunch&amp;#34; and leave an edge on the nail.  This is not rocket science, or so I thought.  I finally had to mail order clippers from Amazon, and these do just what they a supposed to do: cut fingernails.</li>
            <li> really not worth the money, plastic on the side prevent cutting easily</li>
            <li> I have waited a whole year to review this product since I received it, and overall I am very disappointed. Having read such glowing reviews, I expected a true quality nail clipper - this is not the case.  I have outlined the pros and cons below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt; - Nice large nail file on the back.&lt;br /&gt; - Plastic nail catcher is useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt; - It cuts nails very poorly.&lt;br /&gt; - When closed, you can visibly see the top and bottom of the nail clipper does not line up&lt;br /&gt; - Leaves nails sharp after cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried to justify the price somehow, but have reverted back to using my old nail clipper as this one is horrible. AVOID!</li>
            <li> My whole life I&#x27;ve used those cheap clippers you get from a bin on the counter of the drug store, and never even gave a thought to the existence of higher quality clippers. I bought these on a whim, and it was a good decision. They are very sharp and leave a nice clean edge with very little effort. Overall I&#x27;m happy I got them.</li>
            <li> Hinge and materials are sturdy heavy material.  Cuts right every time and easier too.  It comes with a bottom plastic sleeve for the bottom.  All materials are high quality as well</li>
            <li> Seem to be high quality. Have had them for five months, and they have a resounding \\&quot;cling\\&quot; sound, sharp blades, and no rust.</li>
            <li> Works great, does the job of cutting my nails.</li>
            <li> We agree with all the positive reviews.  These are the best clippers we have ever seen or ever even hoped to see.  We are buying another for a gift.</li>
            <li> I mistakenly purchased the Mehaz #660 believing they were the toe clippers, but the Mehaz toe clippers are #662. It&#x27;s hard to tell the size and type from the pictures alone. Just want to save someone else making the same mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it was a fortunate mistake as these clippers are fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Size:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The #660 is a smaller size (the size of normal nail clippers) and is for your fingernails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Construction:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clippers are made from high quality stainless steel and can be dipped in disinfectant liquid without rusting. The steel is in a beautiful brush finish&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cutting head is curved, not straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package said these were made in Vietnam. Other Mehaz clippers say made in Japan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have a lifetime warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Function:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work great. They cut nails precisely and neatly. The clippers fit inside a plastic sleeve that catches the nail trimmings and includes an adhered file attachment that is great quality and has a fine grit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers are a work of art, both form and function! I love these clippers!</li>
            <li> very good a little disappointed with the nail catcher but as a nail clipper is pretty good</li>
            <li> Best nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever used and it has a cover :)</li>
            <li> Nice, clean cuts, but the plastic housing to catch the clippings is not very useful.</li>
            <li> I hesitated to give five stars to this product because it&#x27;s fingernail clippers and it seemed wrong, somehow, to give five stars to fingernail clippers. But they do what they do very well. Truly, they do clip more smoothly and easily than other clippers I have had, which were mostly the kind you&#x27;d find in a grocery store. Plus the plastic housing retains the nail, keeping it from throwing clipped fingernail pieces all over the room, which has always been something that would gross me out, although in a minor way. So for what they are, they are very good.</li>
            <li> I expected more from this nail clipper based on the price I paid.  I cut my finger nails either after I wash or bathe.  When I clip my nails, the clippers does not clip the whole nail so I end up clipping several times, and, I am left with hang nails on the end of my nails.  Because of the plastic nail covering, it is hard to clip the end of the nail. I could have purchased a nail clipper for half the price that would have done a better job.  The nail clipper does stop the nails from flying all over the place when clipping.</li>
            <li> First things first, these are actually KAI clippers which have seemingly been cross-branded as \\&quot;MEHAZ\\&quot; for distribution purposes. Make no mistake, however, that KAI actually manufactures these (KAI, as you may be aware, is the parent company of the high-end Shun knife brand). All over, they are marked with \\&quot;KAI\\&quot;, the same logo that you&#x27;ll find on your Shun knives. You can&#x27;t see it in the stock photo, but they&#x27;re branded \\&quot;KAI\\&quot; twice on the steel body, \\&quot;KAI\\&quot; once on the plastic holster, and \\&quot;MEHAZ\\&quot; once on the end of the lever.     Also, these are made in Japan, just like you would expect from any KAI cutlery (they are marked \\&quot;Made in Japan\\&quot; all over). Does this make a difference? Absolutely. As anyone who&#x27;s familiar with cutlery knows, high-end consumer cutting devices usually come from Germany or Japan. The extra cost of manufacturing in Japan is evident when these clippers are in your hand. The entire device is made of brushed stainless steel (lever, body, and fulcrum) so it won&#x27;t rust if water collects on it. The clippers have a nice weight in the hand, and the lever has a satisfying feel as it is pushed downward. The only qualm I have with the cutting action is the lever does not come to a complete stop when pushed down, but rather the assembly of the clipper allows the lever to be pushed further downward with additional force. This means that clumsy or brutish people who exert a lot of force on these might put excess stress on the fulcrum of the device, which might wear it out over time.     More about the design - the cut is as you would expect from a \\&quot;Made in Japan\\&quot; KAI device; it gives a precise, satisfying \\&quot;click\\&quot; as it cuts at the brittlest of nails. I have not owned these clippers for long, so I cannot comment about the longetivity of the blades on the clipper. The clipper also has a small hole on the rear of the body (presumably for lanyards or something like that). Also, there is a similar slot at the end of the plastic holster, which brings me to that feature.    These clippers come housed in a plastic holster which is presumably for storing clipped nails. Also, the holster has a steel nail file on the underside, and like the clippers, is marked \\&quot;KAI Made in Japan\\&quot;. The holster is moderately cumbersome because it restricts the angle you can clip at (you can see in the stock photo that it obscures the edges of the blade arc). However, the holster is easily removed; it takes about 1 second or even less if you are particularly nimble. Another review on here deducted an entire star because of this design feature. That&#x27;s nonsensical - you need to remove the holster anyway when you dispose of the clippings, so why would removing it once merit a 4-star review? I was irked by that because these are 5-star clippers and truly don&#x27;t deserve a 4-star review from someone hunting for reasons to justify it.     Finally, these clippers are a bit less expensive than the other well-reviewed clippers on Amazon (the Seki Edge ones). I haven&#x27;t tried those, but judging by the design and manufacturing origin of the two, I&#x27;m guessing that they cut and are in fact designed very similarly. Therefore, at nearly half the price of the Seki Edge, I think that these KAI clippers are a great value.</li>
            <li> My toe nails are really thick.  This just didn&#x27;t do it. I&#x27;m going toe try toe nail Nippers nest.</li>
            <li> The clipper arrived on time and was what I expected. I would however wish there was a model available that was at least 1\\&quot; wide to cover the entire toenail, although I might have missed this model at Amazon. Very old people have a problem operating these things because they don&#x27;t have the strength in their fingers.  JJK</li>
            <li> High quality - fair price</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know a pair of nail clippers could actually be nice. If you&#x27;ve been using cheap supermarket nail clippers your whole life, you&#x27;ll find these pretty impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re not going to change your life or anything though. They&#x27;re still just nail clippers.</li>
            <li> I never thought about the quality of my nail clippers, but these are literally fantastic.  I will always look for this brand.</li>
            <li> This is the best nail clipper I&#x27;ve ever used. It is comfortable to hold and use. It is super sharp, slicing through nails like butter, or something. The nail catcher plastic part looks good and fits onto the metal clipper very nicely; it almost clicks into place in the front position so it doesn&#x27;t slide back when you don&#x27;t want it to. Also, the plastic catcher part has a built-in nail file on the underside which is made of metal and is quite handy. I&#x27;m really happy with the quality of the metal cutter and plastic catcher both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cutting tip is not large, but I have not had any problem with it so far. I like to cut several times per nail anyway for a smoother result, so I don&#x27;t really care if the cutting edge can&#x27;t cover my whole nail at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is solidly constructed and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll have to worry about nail clippers in the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> On arrival blades were not aligned. This results in all cut edges to be angled sharply, producing very sharp nails. Additionally, the offset blades make clipping difficult as the nail edge is often pushed out between the blades rather than clipped. The plastic catch has a narrow opening that makes it difficult to get nails into the gap, yet is wide enough to allow many clippings to pop out; the worst of both worlds. Further, the plastic catch directs nail clippings in between the blades near their fusion resulting in clippings that cannot be dislodged from the set. They are wedged into the seam and now cannot be removed. These are perhaps the worst nail clippers I have ever had the displeasure of using, and the price serves only to add insult to noxious experience.</li>
            <li> As a man who used the cheap clippers I found around the house from other people all my life, I finally decided to go get my own nice pair. This was a GREAT decision, and these clippers are like the Ferrari or Rolls Royce of nail clippers. Right out of the box, they are sharp and cut crisp even lines. It took very little effort to trim my nails which were way longer than they should have been for a man. You can get them wet too, and they won&#x27;t rust. Do yourself a favor and quit using those cheapie half dull ones you can get for a dollar. Treat yourself to luxury without breaking the bank. These are worth every penny and then some.</li>
            <li> I rarely submit reviews for amazon items as most current reviews are very accurate. However, I had to let everyone know what a piece of junk this clipper is, worst than $2 drug store clippers.  The cutting edges don&#x27;t line up and it moves out of alignment when you put pressure on it to cut nails(think of it as an \\&quot;overbite\\&quot;). The blades just breaks off the nails instead of cutting it. It also makes a double click noise when you release, blades snapping back to normal position.  I tried to realign the blades but it is impossible as the upper blade moves back and forth, depending on how much pressure is put on the clipper to cut.</li>
            <li> Awsome price, super sharp, makes clean cuts, and the plastic cover helps prevent nails from flying anywhere.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a nicely made, precise, sharp, heavy-duty nail clipper. The radius is pretty appropriate for both small and large fingers/thumbs and it works exceedingly well compared to cheap knock-off it replaced.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to spend the extra money on these vs the cheaper drug store clippers but I&#x27;m glad I did. They&#x27;re very sharp and cut 10 times better than any of the cheap clippers ever did. They cost more than the standard clippers but they&#x27;re worth every penny. The clippings catcher is basically useless though, I just pulled it off and threw it away.</li>
            <li> Much sharper and better cutting than the average nail clipper.</li>
            <li> The clippers are super sharp but the plastic case gets in the way on the curved side portion of the nail.</li>
            <li> Small for woman&#x27;s finger nails!</li>
            <li> This good quality nail clipper is sharp and makes a good clean cut on finger nails. Much better than other drug store clippers. Will buy to use for small gifts.</li>
            <li> cutter is 7/16&amp;#34; wide and the clipper length is 2 5/8 long.  I am returning for a wider cutter.</li>
            <li> This clipper is extremely sharp and well made. You can definitely see the quality construction in the product, and you can feel it with the smooth clipping action and click of the perfectly aligned very sharp cutting surfaces. That is what I would expect from a KAI product (they are a Japanese cutlery manufacturer, MEHAZ is apparently the sub-brand).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic catch has small side cutouts to allow larger nails to fit in the clipper, while still catching the clippings. It really only works to catch small finger-nail clippings, as toenails will come off in large chunks in front, never really falling back into the clipper (perhaps this depends in your cutting style though, whether you clip all at once or take small cuts). I did not find it annoying, and even though it \\&quot;got in the way\\&quot; a couple of times, I&#x27;m fairly certain this is just a matter of technique and getting used to this way of targeting the nail. It depends on the angle you approach your nail with. You can always take off the guard if you don&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a small file on the bottom, handy if you don&#x27;t need a fulll file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the picture makes it seem as though the handle is in an awkward position, pointing too far up. This is not the case. The handle is easy to operate with low resistance, and not awkward. I tend to clip holding it \\&quot;sideways\\&quot; though, not aligned straight with my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, well worth the price. I would buy it again if this ever broke (but something tells me this clipper might outlast me)</li>
            <li> This is the straight version of the angled toenail clipper and I found after some work with the both clippers that this is a good combination.&lt;br /&gt;Works well.</li>
            <li> Highest quality clippers I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> These are really good clippers. Sturdy and sharp. I like the plastic toenail catcher but mine flew the opposide direction. Haa.</li>
            <li> I ordered these since the generic clippers that you can buy at the store were never sharp or strong enough to get through my husband&#x27;s toe nails. I am happy to say that these were worth the extra money and effortlessly cut through his thick toe nails! The only con to this product that I could find is that I washed these clippers in some warm water and dawn dish soap and the bottom of the clipper rusted a tiny bit. Still would recommened these clippers regardless of the tiny bit of rust!</li>
            <li> I am not impressed with these nail clippers at all.  They just snip the nail and leave it hanging.&lt;br /&gt;This is my first experience with nail clippers that don&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li> I bought it because of the insanely great reviews. It does cut well but it leaves very sharp edges so you must file your nails afterwards and is somewhat narrow requiring more cuts per each nail that I would like. Some people already file after cutting their nails so this so that&#x27;s fine for them, but it was an added step for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had and currently have a much better one that is wider at the cutting point (easier to use/fine tuned cuts) and leaves no sharp edges. For the price I will likely buy something else the next time.</li>
            <li> works well. doesnt hold many clippings so it needs to be empty OFTEN sometimes multiple times during one usage. but its better then my husband leaving nasty nail clippings all over</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that the clipper was much smaller than it appeared on the pictures. Particularly the cutting surface is too small for a man&#x27;s fingers. Also, these clippers are not made in Japan as another reviewer stated.</li>
            <li> This is the best nail clipper that I have ever used.  It cuts cleanly and takes very little pressure.  I have rheumatoid arthritis and I have no problem using the Mehaz 660 clipper.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say about nail clippers since they really only have one function and it comes down to whether they can cut nails or not.  Well they do cut nails and so far they cut them well.  I did remove the \\&quot;guard\\&quot; because it got in the way.  If it wasn&#x27;t for that I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This is a nice nail clipper, I love good quality tools and designs, believe me, the sound that this clipper makes every time you use it is awsome, I know it sounds weird but I like the sound, it is not annoying as usually with other nail clippers.</li>
            <li> Well made, sturdy. Requires very little effort on even your thickest nails (toe!). The ends come out not as smooth as I&#x27;d expect from a \\&quot;professional\\&quot; clipper, though I don&#x27;t really know what professional clippers are supposed to do. I&#x27;m guessing that might be an obvious result as you&#x27;re supposed to file your nails after clipping them. Anyway, I feel it&#x27;s too big to clip those pesky kittle stuff around your nails. They&#x27;re only for the nails. Can&#x27;t seem to find a small clipper to take care of those.</li>
            <li> Very good clippers. Gives a clean cut with no rough edges.</li>
            <li> I bought two strictly on their recommendations from this site. Their great at cutting nails period!I love them plain and simple!</li>
            <li> No one should ever equate heaven with nail clippers, but they are that good. Smooth, good blade, lightweight. My practical side resisted spending this much money on nail clippers, but the other reviews are right. You won&#x27;t ever go back to drugstore clippers again! For something you do routinely, you should have a tool that is easy to use and efficient.</li>
            <li> Pros:  1. Cuts well, it is brand new.  2. Comes with a plastic cover.  Cons:  1. Slightly rough finish. Rough feeling when opening and twisting handle. Some corners are sharp for no reason, nothing too bad.  2. When open it is wide, makes holding it awkward.  3. The upper handle is very smooth and since it opens so wide it is somewhat hard to hold and control.  Package says made in Vietnam, clipper itself says KAI and made in Japan. Over all, Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper is better made and cuts better. It is heavier than the MEHAZ and have a better finish. The handle is shorter and has a notch so when using it it is controlled easier than the MEHAZ.</li>
            <li> forward to receiving these clippers.  If the quality is the same as the toenail clipper I will almost be in heaven.  Thanks for the great products.</li>
            <li> I bought this nail clipper thinking it would be better because of the high end price tag and the brand name as being professional, but I was very wrong and very disappointed. The only good thing about this purchased was that the stainless steel doesn&#x27;t rust even if you soaked it in liquid solution..the problem I noticed was it doesn&#x27;t cut your nail smoothly..what I mean is it&#x27;s end product is rough no matter how nicely you guide and cut your nail..but if you don&#x27;t mind taking 10 to 15 minutes more with filing it smoothly..no way I would recommend this nail clipper to anyone...you&#x27;re better off buying revlon.</li>
            <li> The product was as shown and works well. I would recommend it to anyone in need of this type of product.</li>
            <li> Let me first say that this is a very high quality nail clipper. I can easily tell the difference when holding this one compared to the cheapy, cheap one I had before. It feels more solid, it moves smoothly, and it trims very, very well since the blades are very sharp and perfectly aligned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing is it doesn&#x27;t have a feature I want, and it has an additional fixture that I really don&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;I miss having an attached cuticle/file thing that swivels out. I mainly used it to dig gunk from out under my noenails. Now I have to keep a separate tool on hand to do that. But that was my fault that I didn&#x27;t realize it didn&#x27;t have it. So no stars taken away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other issue is the toenail clip catcher thing. I find it just gets in the way. I would take it off and throw it out except, it has to be on the clipper in order to hold the handle in place. There is no other way the handle, when closed, will stay aligned with the clipper. So I have to take in on and off each time I want to use it. It&#x27;s kind of crazy how this minor thing keeps bugging me. So I had to take away one star for that.</li>
            <li> The clippers are excellent as many have noted. The clipper is sharp and cuts very cleanly and easily. It has excellent leverage so the cutting is easy. I find that the blue plastic housing (a) does not catch all the clippings and (b) gets in the way. So I removed it and use the clippers without the housing.  The clippers come inside a \\&quot;card\\&quot; consisting of stiff cardboard and a hard plastic bubble. The clippers are inside the plastic. It was difficult to tear or otherwise cut the cardboard to get the bubble open. I cut my finger doing so. So I suggest getting a strong pair of scissors or some other cutting implement to carefully open the package.  I recommend the clippers - just be careful opening the package.</li>
            <li> I wish Amazon provided clear details of where a product was made in their product description. Perhaps this info was there and I just missed it. I was hoping for nail cutters made in Japan like a pair of Kai Samurai clippers I had previously used. These were made in Vietnam. I was set on returning these, but when I looked at the cutting surface through the packaging and noticed the sharpness, I decided to try them out. They worked very well compared to the dull cutters you will find in a brick and mortar store. Time will tell how these hold up in the long run. For now, they seem to work very well.</li>
            <li> This nail cutter is great, I love the satisfying click at the end of each press. It cuts hand and toe nails well. I took off the plastic nail catcher that comes attached to it, I don&#x27;t have an interest in using that function, and the clipper looks sleeker and better overall without it. Its very hard to find good clippers these days, but this is definitely a find. I would have given this product 5 stars but...when I was born, a friend of my parents got them clippers as a marriage gift. It was a simple piece from Korea branded with \\&quot;Bell\\&quot; To this day, 20 years later, those clippers are still as good as new, they look brand new, they cut like magic and we all fight over it! Now that I&#x27;m in college its a hassle to get those clippers from my parents home and back to them when I&#x27;m done (I actually did this for the first 2 years of college). I could not find the Bell clippers from Korea online anywhere, so I decided to go with this pair since it got good reviews and the price wasn&#x27;t too bad considering I intend to use it for a long, long time. If you are looking for a quality piece for yourself or the family, get these \\&quot;Mehaz\\&quot; clippers, it does the job well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Goku</li>
            <li> I was very dissapointed in this product.  I purchasted it to cut my toenails and it would not cut at all.  I tried it on my fingernails and same problem. WOULD NOT CUT AT ALL!  It was a waist of money!!</li>
            <li> Too narrow to fit my nails</li>
            <li> It was smaller than I thought, but it does its job perfectly.</li>
            <li> Amazing, I was a bit skeptical to pay so much for clippers, but I was shocked at what a difference it makes. I&#x27;ve been telling everyone I know to get these.</li>
            <li> These are a Kai brand made in Vietnam. I&#x27;ve had them for 2 years and bought another for a gift.</li>
            <li> I got it more than one year and still love it.  very sharp easy to use. The plastic case collect well.</li>
            <li> Great product, awesome for adult fingernails, even better for babies and toddlers (warning: you must have ninja type controls). f</li>
            <li> This clipper does its job cleanly, better than any I have had from a drug store or Walmart type store in the last 60 years or so.  The clipped nail retainer is useless, but easy to remove and throw away.</li>
            <li> SUPER product, well worth the price paid. If you have thick toenails, this clipper will make cutting them a lot easier and with far better results than pliers type cutters or the typical toenail clippers do. I only regret not investing in this clipper much sooner. Would definitely buy another pair at this price, even considering the shipping cost.</li>
            <li> I always used to wonder why my nails would split and catch on clothes when I trimmed them. I even tried to file them to even them out but they still snagged on things. Well I read reviews of these nail clippers and some people experienced the same issues as I did before using these nail clippers. All I can say is WOW, what a difference a good set of nail clippers make. These are amazingly sharp and I no longer even need to file my nails because they no longer catch on things. I am very happy with these and I&#x27;ll never use a cheap set again because you do get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE!!!&lt;br /&gt;They seem to have lost their bite and it seems harder to get them to cut after about 6 months of ownership.</li>
            <li> The product rusted after a couple of times using it.  It is not worth the price and I would go with other options.</li>
            <li> These clippers are really nice. So nice I have them put away from my family and they have to ask to use them and then return them to me when finished..lol Just don&#x27;t want to lose them!</li>
            <li> If you think all nail clippers are equal, think again.  Try this MEHAZ 660 professional nail Clipper.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for the BEST nail clipper, because you&#x27;re tired of clipping your nails with dull, rusted clippers, try this MEHAZ 660 professional nail Clipper.  We&#x27;ve had this almost a year now and it has not rusted or become dull.  Would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> These are excellent fingernail clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are very poor toenail clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cutting edge of the clippers does not fit easily underneath thicker toenails, making it almost impossible to clip these nails. Drugstore clippers work better.</li>
            <li> These clippers are very sharp and cut well.  However, the plastic cover is so awkward that it makes the clippers almost unusable.  The file is on the plastic cover rather than a part of the clippers so if you remove the plastic cover, there is no file.  The clipper width also makes them awkward to use.  Functional but overpriced.</li>
            <li> innacurate description</li>
            <li> These clippers are very sharp and cut very well. They need less strength in the hands to use, so they are very good for hands with arthritis (or some other weakness).</li>
            <li> I purchased this item based on all the positive reviews on Amazon. Unfortunately, it does not cut properly; it always leaves my nails very blunt. Would not repurchase.</li>
            <li> These clippers work great! I&#x27;ve found them to cut easier and cleaner than other &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; clipper brands like Tweezerman and Seki. I am not a huge fan of the sheath, as it&#x27;s rather loose on the clippers, but it does not seem to get in the way much. Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> I really love this clipper. It has good build quality.&lt;br /&gt;The functionality is also reasonably good and sharp enough head.........</li>
            <li> The first nail clipper I owned that actually works the way one would expect. Clean cuts, great lever.</li>
            <li> Looks good, starts off working well, but dulls easily and loses pressure, soon can&#x27;t cut tougher nails anymore.</li>
            <li> Very impressive clippers!  These clippers cut precisely and are very easy to use.</li>
            <li> After owning these for a few months, I think I can say these clippers are one of the worst.  The blades don&#x27;t match up very well.  I can only use one side of the clipper.  More often than not fingernails are just crushed or torn rather than clipped.  Save your money and get something else.</li>
            <li> These really are high end clippers.  I have used several clippers in my life and you can really tell the difference with these clippers.  They are highly recommended.  I lost one set on vacation and I immediately ordered a new set as I have not found any that match in quality as these.</li>
            <li> Very, VERY sharp.  You have to be very careful or you will take a chunk of flesh off without knowing it.  The ends are especially sharp.  Good quality but will not buy again.  Back to the $1.50 drugstore ones.</li>
            <li> Clumsy design. Not worth the premium.</li>
            <li> Not well suited for my hands .  I returned it.</li>
            <li> Very sharp nail clipper; however, the sides of the blades are too sharp making it very difficult to slide the clipper along your nail.  You need to open the blades and reposition every time you make another cut.  For this price, it really should do a little better job and be more ergonomically friendly.</li>
            <li> So sharp, cuts perfect every time.  The teeth are slightly larger (taller) than I&#x27;m used to which is harder to get under the nail.</li>
            <li> Excellent Clippers.  The catcher really does work, and the wide handle makes clipping easy, we bought several more pairs after trying these.</li>
            <li> These nail clippers are super easy and super sharp. I never knew that finger nails could be trimmed as easily as these clippers make it.</li>
            <li> Clippers are very easy to use and don&#x27;t require much pressure at all to clip fingernails. The only downside is that they do leave the fingernails just a bit ragged in places, but this is quickly touched up by a nail file. A built-in file would be handy because I don&#x27;t carry one with me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe I got clipped; however, if they DO open farther than standard toe-nail clippers, it is by a very small amount, probably not easily measureable. They are, however, very well made, and truly are better than standard clippers. - Gary</li>
            <li> The quality (good solid build) is good.  However they don&#x27;t cut like I expected.  I have had others that leave a smooth edge when they cut, but this one leaves the nail a little rough.</li>
            <li> Cuts nail cleanly but I removed the plastic nail catcher because it got in the way.  A little bit pricey but it works well, looks great, and will likely stay sharper longer than the cheaper cutters.</li>
            <li> I am embarrassed but pleased to have spent this much money on a nail clipper. It&#x27;s the nicest one I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Very Sharp.  You know how sometimes you have a nail clipper that&#x27;s a little dull and it kind of takes ragged bites off of your fingernails?  Well not this one.  This one is very sharp and clips very easily.  It would be great if you could train your errant fingernails to properly place themselves into the little plastic sleeve that fits over the top...I have found that about half of them go in and half of them go whatever direction that they please.  The sleeve is better than nothing though.</li>
            <li> These are hands down the sharpest  clippers I have ever owned. The quality is unparallelled by anything you can find at the local drug store.</li>
            <li> These are about perfect in every way - the only exception being it&#x27;s a bit difficult to cut the big toe nail since these have the smaller size clippers instead of the full, standard size (if you know what I&#x27;m talking about).  Apart from that, they are quite sharp and do a great job of catching nails so they don&#x27;t go flying all over the room, which is nice.  Just tap it over a trash can every nail or two and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> save your money and buy this and never have to buy another sad clipper. this is one of the products that are simply MUCH better than the cheap version that it is worth buying and using.</li>
            <li> These are very nice clippers. Cheaper than others but I think just as functional. Much better than the normal cheap clippers from WalMart.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic clippers for the money.  Sharp, accurate - you can spend much more, but why? These are exceptionally well made and competitively priced.</li>
            <li> LOVE these clippers and so glad I bought them. Previously had used clippers purchased at the big box stores and thought that was as good as it got, until I tried these. A very smooth, clean cut without pulling or tearing. Definitely worth the price, highly recommend. The quality is excellent! Also purchased the toe nail clippers.</li>
            <li> These are supposed to be the best nail clippers. They do definitely clip nails. However they don&#x27;t leave a pretty shape therefore I have to spend a lot of time trying to keep my nails looking decent and usually they jus don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Greatest professional quality Clipper made in Germany with high quality steel. Same as any other clippers but better quality. Thank you for a great price too</li>
            <li> My husband is really anal with having his nails trimmed and was told this nail clipper would be the best but when we got it, it wasn&#x27;t all it cracked up to be. It does it job but a little too great. The clipper clips like cutting into butter but a little too scary for his taste. It gives your nail a sharp finish after cutting. He didn&#x27;t like that feeling. However, the clipper is great for someone that uses it daily or works in a nail salon that has to use it commercially. Great clipper over all but a little too commercial for us.</li>
            <li> what a beauty this is.  I bet I could cut plywood with it if I had to.  Goes through the big toe nail like it was cutting a piece of paper.  Very sharp, well made (not made in China...no duh).  Well worth the extra bucks for a much better unit than you get in a drug store.</li>
            <li> The quality and construction of the product seems to be very good.  However the actual cutting edge on mine do not match up at all and so they are worthless for the purpose of a nail clipper.  The cheap nail clippers at the dollar store do a MUCH better job than my pair. This model is also very narrow so better fit for someone with small hands such as a child or small lady.  I would guess they are normally pretty good but my pair must have been missed by any type of quality control check.</li>
            <li> Good enough for the price. The lack of that little file that spins out is why I didn&#x27;t give it 5stars.</li>
            <li> You can feel the quality in the metal and when you clip nails, as it just doesn&#x27;t feel like the cheap drug store clippers you get. I just took the little sleeve off. Your nails don&#x27;t fly too far.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  Fast shipping and reasonable price.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> impossible to see where you&#x27;re cutting</li>
            <li> A well made clipper. good ergonomics. very sharp with an audible click ! it would have bee five stars if not for the unnecessary useless nail catcher attached. Makes it difficult to use so you should remove it  not needed clip your nails over the sink . a silly addition</li>
            <li> On Amazon, for top-rated, Mehaz and Seki dominate in regards to nail clippers.  Some people scoff at a good pair and settle for drugstore brands and others who have bought this one just don&#x27;t know a good thing when they hold it in their hands!  I am on a stenographic keyboard 30 hours out of the week these days, and short nails are imperative for accuracy.      This one goes above and beyond.  Has a beautiful clear compartment to catch stray nails (which I enjoy). It&#x27;s crafted to perfection, made in Japan.  It cuts cleanly and is long, and so, very easy to use.    I cut my nails once a week, and let me tell you, it is such a relief to finally trash my $4 Avon nail clipper for this high-quality piece.  Also, this is nearly half the price of the Seki, and I just cannot see how a nail clipper could improve in anyway.  Popularity is not always the best way.  So pleased with this purchase/fast shipment/quality product, and I&#x27;m sure you would be too.    -M</li>
            <li> Great clippers.  I have some arthritis in my hands and this is the first clippers I have found in forever that actually cuts where I want it to cut.   I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is simply the best nail clipper money can buy.. I have used it for months and am impressed at how silky smooth it operates and leaves nails so cleanly cut no filing is required. Nothing compares not even the more expensive clippers can touch this..</li>
            <li> These nail clippers are top rated on review sites. They are very high quality. I bought three pairs. I would recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I write, however, to note two quibbles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, they rust. So even though they are made better than cheap, chrome drugstore alternatives, you will have to care for them -- that, I suppose, is an important life lesson anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, they are bulkier at the cutting edge. That means there is a bit less control over how much exactly you&#x27;re cutting, so if you&#x27;re obsessive about your nails lining up it will be harder to achieve precision.</li>
            <li> These are great clippers. The nail catcher works, but has flaws. It blocks getting close for like hang nails. Also misses some nail clippings. Over all I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I HAVE HAD THESE A COUPLE OF YEARS AND THEY ARE AS SHARP AS THE DAY I BOUGHT THEM. ONCE AGAIN U GET WHAT YOU PAY 4.</li>
            <li> The plastic sleeve which appears to be there to catch &amp;#34;clippings&amp;#34; is completely in the way and makes these clippers very cumbersome to use.  REMOVE the plastic sleeve and they feel like solid regular clippers.</li>
            <li> Nail clipper was delivered on time and provides excellent value.</li>
            <li> Finally a nail clipper that actually cuts easily</li>
            <li> The clipped nails don&#x27;t fly everywhere.  I had no idea this technology existed until I read about them on The Sweethome.</li>
            <li> Nice clippers but these things are way too sharp. Mine are not set correctly and they don&#x27;t make a smooth cut in my nails. These nail clippers leave my nails very sharp. Buy a cheaper pair that work good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit longer than the typical drug store nail clipper, about 1 cm longer. I think that the extra length gives you a bit more leverage in bringing together the cutting edges. The finish has a brushed nickel look. It&#x27;s stamped KAI, Stainless Steel, Made in Japan. It cuts cleanly, no doubt about that. The plastic case has a small nail file attached on the bottom, but I found the case of limited use. Yes, it does catch some of the clippings, but it hinders the use of the corners of the cutting edge. I sometimes use those corners to work on cuticles. The case can be removed, but it&#x27;s normally on pretty tight, so some effort is needed to remove it. Lastly, I like the keychain hole at the end -- allows me to attach it with my keys and reduces the chance of losing them (which was what happened to my previous clipper!). Overall this was a good buy -- superior quality without an exorbitant price.</li>
            <li> This clipper cuts like a diamond. Very precise and sharp.  The way to describe the &amp;#34;clarity&amp;#34; of the clipping action on this clipper is that it is very crispy.</li>
            <li> This is the best of the nail clippers. We have them in our cars and in several places around our house. Other clippers pale in comparison to the quality of this one</li>
            <li> These are fantastic. I&#x27;ve got several dozen $1.99 Wal Mart nail clippers, and they are all terrible. They don&#x27;t cut through the nail, leave the nail rough, they break, and for years I had no idea there were other options! These clippers are still, in the scheme of things, cheap, but are sharp, ergonomic, heavy duty, and even look nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They include a clippings catcher and a file on the catcher. To be honest, I haven&#x27;t had much luck with the catcher, but I may just be stupid. If there is a trick to it, I don&#x27;t know it, and really, I don&#x27;t have time for tricks when trimming my nails. Just do it over the trash or outside or, I don&#x27;t know, in the kitchen and then sweep up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The file is also a bit janky, a full sized file will be much more effective regardless of the application. Even without the file and the catcher, I wouldn&#x27;t mind paying upwards of $20 for these because I am sure they will continue to perform for a very long time. Now I just have to keep from losing them!</li>
            <li> These are what I have been looking for. They are quality made and cut like butter. Would like them to have been bigger. Going to search for a larger size too.</li>
            <li> The MEHAZ 660 Professional Nail definitely cuts well, but unfortunately that doesn&#x27;t transfer to it&#x27;s use...  The shape of the blades (thick and straight) make this cutter very hard to use and get a good result...  The handle angle is awkward too...</li>
            <li> These clippers were purchased in 2013..  I wanted ones made in Japan, and this website claimed they were so I bought them. But when they arrived, were made in Vietnam! The top and bottom cutting edges were slanted too much inward and the gap between them was too small/narrow, both issues making it very difficult to get the blades around the fingernail for cutting!  And, the curve of the topside handle was positioned all wrong; it was as if they just slapped the curve on the handle anywhere that seemed good but didn&#x27;t test it out! Every time I used these clippers my thumb constantly slid down that sloped handle, and I would lose my grip on the clippers while trying to cut my nails. This caused a lot of frustration and anxiety over potentially cutting myself.&lt;br /&gt;Since thiis awful tool was bought couple of years ago, perhaps they have improved by now? Who knows what country they&#x27;re made in now?!</li>
            <li> metal has a strange feeling but it works great.</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp. Hope it stays that way. Makes a clean clip.</li>
            <li> I removed the plastic &amp;#34;nail catcher&amp;#34; because it makes it hard to see what you are doing.  These are nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They feel substantial.  I bought these to replace a pair of Revlon clipper that broke.  (the handle snapped into two pieces.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to replace these with ordinary clippers. I can&#x27;t manipulate this pair or fit them where I want them to cut, so the corners of my nails are unclipped and sharp. I would call them unforgiving and arbitrary--we all know how difficult such people are. Just like these clippers!</li>
            <li> really good fingernail clipper.  Best I have used.  I threw away the others.</li>
            <li> Sharpest Nail Clipper. Love it!</li>
            <li> Totally useless. Bought this product to cut fingernails but it is to thick to get under my nails. Perhaps it was designed for toe nails.</li>
            <li> high quality, cut as many nails as you want.</li>
            <li> The Ferrari of fingernail clippers.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, but the file fell off after only two uses.</li>
            <li> This is a massive step up in an otherwise ubiquitous item.  No more jagged edges!  No more foot work where the clipper just can&#x27;t cut through that big toe growth!!!  This clipper is the bomb!!</li>
            <li> Best pair of nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
            <li> very sharp cutting blades, easier on my nails.</li>
            <li> Excellent nail clipper that is easy to use with either hand.  Clips nails easily with little effort.  Would advise that the high price is well worth it!</li>
            <li> The best clipper available.  Also use the fingernail model.  Have used quite a few other models, which have all been fine, but this model is the best.</li>
            <li> My previous nail clippers were cheap drugstore clippers that were acceptable, but not great.  My wife and I decided to get some better clippers for a nicer nail-clipping experience.    The Pros:   - These clippers cut very well.  There is no need for filing afterwards.   - The nail catcher actually works.  The Cons:   - The price.  I bought these for $12.  While they are better than cheap nail clippers, they are by no means an amazing product, and in my opinion, do not warrant such a price.  Overall, I&#x27;d recommend these for anyone who does not like cheap drugstore nail clippers.  While expensive for nail clippers, they do clip better than cheaper alternatives.</li>
            <li> I bought this nail clipper with high expectations based on other reviewers’ experience.  With all honesty, however, after being frustrated with the quality of this clipper, I impose myself to take the time to warn other potential buyers about a major design flaw in this product: the “blade-lever” is relatively longer than usual and way, but way too flexible and flimsy.  As a result, the lever works as a spring and flattens so much to the point of touching the “base”, so to speak, on the other side, when pressed.  I learned that nail clippers need to be precise and sturdy for one to have control.  Nail clippers are not in the spring mattress category.  Often with this product “the belly” of my pressing fingers got hurt as the lever squeezed them in its way to the base.  My old nail clipper is being called back to work.  Best regards to all from Brazil!  Peace!  Claudio</li>
            <li> These clippers performed noticeably worse than the cheapest Rite-Aid set of clippers.They were nearly unusable with the plastic tray attached and performed just slightly better after removing it. The blade width is very narrow with too deep a curve and the design makes it very difficult to get the cutting blade under the edge of a nail.</li>
            <li> I was amazed when I first used these clippers. There&#x27;s no &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; like with cheaper clippers, that&#x27;s because these are so sharp they are actually cutting through the nail instead of basically breaking it. The nail catcher seems to work as advertised as well. I&#x27;ll be re-ordering the toenail version soon.</li>
            <li> It is flimsy, and did not meet my expectation. There are a lot of better clips locally. I ordered this thinking that it is special since it was supposed to be &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Cuts very nicely. Plastic nail catcher is in the way at times but is easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Nice high quality clippers. The nail catcher kinda gets in the way of cutting sometimes but it still cuts effortlessly and without leaving a sharp edge. Highly recommended!!!!!!</li>
            <li> they work so easy hold very well in hand I would buy another and keep on buying them as I needed</li>
            <li> This is the best nail clipper I&#x27;ve ever had.  It&#x27;s super sharp, cuts smoothly.  Most the clippings are caught in the clear plastic housing. I can now clip my finger nails more often without worrying about the clippings flying all over the places.  Should have had it long ago.</li>
            <li> I hate these nail clippers. They do not cut cleanly; after clipping my nails are torn &amp; ripped. The look and feel of the clippers is great (nice size/weight, comfortable &amp; sturdy), but they simply do a terrible job of clipping nails!</li>
            <li> It is not as big as some reviews said. It fits me perfectly and I am a normal height person. The product is made in Vietnam, and works perfect. Lose one point for the look/design, kind of ugly.</li>
            <li> Make nail cutting a pleasure. I can&#x27;t wait for my nails to grow back!</li>
            <li> This nail trimmer cuts very nicely. Has a very smooth motion and comfortable to hold. Doesn&#x27;t feel cheap. Good purchase!</li>
            <li> These clippers do exactly what you&#x27;d expect, but what I appreciate is the size. I&#x27;m 6&#x27;5, and I often find health and beauty tools too small for my hands. These fit comfortably, are solidly constructed and work well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sharp, and has an ergonomic shape for better grip. The trimming catcher is just a bother, but the nail file that&#x27;s attached to the catcher is very good — so I peeled it off (it&#x27;s held in place with adhesive) and stuck it to the bottom of the trimmer itself. Perfect!</li>
            <li> the hype they were advertised to be.</li>
            <li> Nice sharp clippers. I&#x27;ll never go back to the drug store clippers after using these.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nail cutter, how good can it really be.  This one is really the best.  The blades are so sharp that it cuts clean with very minimal effort.  I wish I knew about these a long time ago, because these are my favorite.  Not too into the nail shaving holder, but that&#x27;s really not a big deal.</li>
            <li> I gave this a three star rating instead of more stars in that it was offered on Amazon.com as a toenail clipper.  It doesn&#x27;t open far enough for clipping the average toenail.  If you have thin toenails I think it would do a good job but for most people probably not.  It is a precision made clpper and very sharp, does a great job on my fingernails.  Unfortunately not on my toenails.</li>
            <li> Tired of the 99 cent clippers that bend your nails instead of cutting them.  This does the trick!</li>
            <li> These clippers cut nails cleanly and with little effort because they are sharp. This is an excellent product for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Great clippers, excellent cut and grip.</li>
            <li> This is the first Professional Nail Clipper I&#x27;ve every purchased, and I&#x27;ve got to say I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying any cheap nail clippers for the rest of my life. I can use this for both my finger-nails and toe-nails, and it cuts like butter. The clipping catcher is also a great feature and works very well; I haven&#x27;t had any nail clippings flying away since using this product.</li>
            <li> The size for fingernails.  You need a different larger design or toenails.  It works easily and is very sharp so cuts very easy.  This requires each nail to be cut in little sections in sequence.  You can&#x27;t just chop off a whole nail at one go.</li>
            <li> These clippers are the bomb!  How anyone could negatively review them is mind boggling!  They are sharp and sleek...and the rough finish, there by design, helps to hold them securely.  Am going to order another pair!</li>
            <li> These clippers are actually KAI branded, which is the parent company of Kershaw Knives, Shun Cutlery, and Zero Tolerance Knives.  I&#x27;ve never owned any Shun or Zero Tolerance products, but all of my Kershaws are of top quality materials and construction.  These clippers are no different.  They operate extremely smooth and cut clean with no sharp edge like all of the others.  Use these once and you&#x27;ll never go back to the cheap drug-store clippers you usually use.</li>
            <li> First off - this is by far the best nail clipper I have ever used. Sharp, precise, smooth cutting performance, with almost effortless action makes this a best buy for me. I recommend this to anyone who is fed up with trimming nails with mediocre &amp;#34;promotional giveaway&amp;#34; clippers - do yourself and nails a favor and grab one of these treasures. Absolutely no complaints about the instrument.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipping catcher is a different story, however. It does not catch all the clippings, and if you chance to tip it for a more advantageous cutting angle, it will dump all or some of the already caught clippings.&lt;br /&gt; Easy to fix!&lt;br /&gt; I remove the clipping catcher from the clipper before starting and clip away, knowing I need to vac after anyway. It does have a nice nail file attached to the underside, so I cannot call it a loss, and slip it onto the clipper after I&#x27;m done using to store it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic. Clean cut, catches clippings. Will be buying the toe clippers soon.  Plan on giving these for holiday gifts.</li>
            <li> The Good: They have a really sharp blade, and cutting is effortless.&lt;br /&gt;The Bad: They lack that piece I use for cleaning under my nails. The &amp;#34;catcher&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t really catch anything. It is HUGE!&lt;br /&gt;The Indifferent: They are made in Vietnam, not Japan.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: I&#x27;m still looking. Want a great blade but also want that file for under the nails.</li>
            <li> This is hands down, the best nail clipper I have ever had.  The feature that collects the clippings doesn&#x27;t really work consistently, but who cares? The clippers are rad</li>
            <li> I have a neuromuscular disease that causes weakness in my hands and cutting my nails was not the easiest task--now it is thanks to these nail clippers!  I used to buy drugstore clippers and would race after a shower or a nail soak to cut my nails while they were still soft and yet I would still struggle using them.  I cut my nails weekly (I prefer short nails) and this is the ONLY clipper I&#x27;ve found that cuts the nail with minimal effort and contains the clippings well in the plastic catch tray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before my cutting routine would take me at least 15 minutes and I&#x27;d have to rev myself up just to do it.  Now it takes only a few minutes and I even enjoy the task because it&#x27;s so easy! I love when a product actually improves my life and makes it easier.  I hope these have a similar effect on your life.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> is an excellent stainless steel clipper that retains a sharp edge and is small enough to put on a keychain for handy access.</li>
            <li> Nice feel and do their job. &#x27;Nuff said about nail clippers.</li>
            <li> Clippers are sharp and substantial as advertised. A little bulky for trimming in tight spots.</li>
            <li> these are the best clippers I have ever had.  they cut even the most stubborn nails with ease.</li>
            <li> Best nail clipper (finger and toe) that I&#x27;ve used in recent memory, and I&#x27;m oddly picky about them. I&#x27;d like a file, but you can&#x27;t always get what you want.</li>
            <li> JUNKIE -- HIT THE TRASH CAN.</li>
            <li> finally a good nail clipper!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different nail cutters many of which resulted in sharp and uncomfortable nails.  This cutter cuts precisely and cleanly.  When I purchased this, I didn&#x27;t even notice that it had a nail catcher.  That was a pleasant surprise.  No more having to sweep up nails from the floor.</li>
            <li> Work really well. Easy to clip nails. My old clippers sometimes would not cut all the way through the nail but these ones seem pretty sharp and they require very little effort to use.&lt;br /&gt;Like that the nail clippings do not fly everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Appreciate that the clippers are relatively small which makes them easier to travel with</li>
            <li> I have always been the person to purchase the cheap nail clippers at the pharmacy, but decided to spend a little more this time. I am that happy I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the bad stuff. The nail clipping catcher is pretty much useless and I have yet to see it function correctly. It&#x27;s not hard to remove, but I just leave it on since it does not get in the way. It just doesn&#x27;t really do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nail file is also built into this cover, which makes it pretty awkward to use. i would suggest getting a stand alone nail file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above two things are why I took a star off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the weird part I had to get use to, the flat face above/below the blades. It&#x27;s hard to describe, but I will do my best. The blades come down vertically, which leaves a flat part that your finger needs to push against to get to the blade. It&#x27;s is something I have become use to now, but it does require you to come in at a different angle compared to cheaper models with a thinner face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This body and lever are much larger than cheaper nail clippers, which makes this thing super easy to handle. The longer lever combined with sharp blades makes it cut really easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The metal is also thick and solid, which makes me believe these will last for many years. My cheap ones were damaged when in my suitcase during travel and I doubt these new ones would have become damaged in the same situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A worthwhile purchase and while I didn&#x27;t give them 5 stars, I would purchase them again. I wish they would give up on the nail catcher though and put a fold out fingernail cleaner and nail file on the device; or just leave them off completely.</li>
            <li> Despite the price, these are cheap &amp; flimsy. I used them once then immediately stopped because I felt like they would break. Also, they don&#x27;t have the mini-file available on most clippers - my fault for not noticing that, but what a miss! Don&#x27;t buy, especially for the cost!!!</li>
            <li> I love to read blogs on the very best of products. Tried this and the Tweezerman, both highly recommended but this wins. Very simply, it doesn&#x27;t split my very soft fingernails. I also thought with the plastic nail catcher it would be cumbersome, not so. Also thought the giant handle would be awkward to use, not so. It it&#x27;s very easy to handle, very sharp, cuts smoothly &amp; quietly. A winner so far!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. Not nearly as heavy duty as I would have expected. The plastic nail catchers on the sides make it a little difficult to use. Not a real difference maker compared to the ones you can pick up for a $1 at any drug store.</li>
            <li> Excellent nail clipper. It is the best I owned so far. Don&#x27;t put it next to water, because it tends to rust, even if it says that is stainless steel.</li>
            <li> MEHAZ 660 Professional Nail Clipper (Model: 9MC0660)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good quality. Big improvement over the cheap ones I used over the years.</li>
            <li> A really top notch clipper: Sharp, nicely aligned, very nice file on the back. Maybe not quite worth the price, but I sure do like how it cuts and smooths. I wish I could easily remove (and replace) the plastic clipping catcher, but no such luck. At least, I can push it back far enough to use the clips on hang nails. Two thumbs (and 8 fingers) up.</li>
            <li> These are the best nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever had, but I&#x27;ve only had cheap ones before.  Super sharp.  I take the plastic &amp;#34;nail catcher&amp;#34; off before I use it, tho, because it does nothing but get in the way.  Good file on it, tho, so I won&#x27;t throw it out.</li>
            <li> Seki is good.&lt;br /&gt;The First Years American Red Cross Deluxe Nail Clipper with Magnifier is also very good and is only $3 when Amazon sells it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mehaz is not bad but not that good.</li>
            <li> Expected these to be the Quality of the Japanese brand KAI, but was not the same. Not sharp and breaks nails.</li>
            <li> Best nail clippers I have ever used.</li>
            <li> These actually cut. I&#x27;ve tried a half dozen other models and these are far superior. The others would try to mash through; getting the nail trimmed was an unbelievable efffort.</li>
            <li> This thing is sick, best pair of nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Seriously, the most minor pressure rips a gorgeous line through your wimpy nails and you&#x27;re left wondering why you ever paid the same price for a crappy pair of Revlon ones at Target.  Buy these, NOW.</li>
            <li> These clippers work very well--they are comfortable and sharp. We have one pair for us and one pair for clipping our cat&#x27;s nails. Because they are so sharp and easy to hold, my cat never wiggles around and doesn&#x27;t mind having her nails cut. I highly recommend these clippers for both felines and humans!</li>
            <li> I ordered these nail clippers based on reviews and was pretty disappointed. I found that these clippers are almost unusable. Very hard to maneuver around my fingers. One thing they did have going for them was the AMAZINGLY sharp cutting edges. Not only can they easily cut through your nails, they can take out a few layers of skin if you are not too careful. I went out and got cheap drugstore clippers and am quite happy. Live and learn.</li>
            <li> I had a really nice manicure set for 45 years until one of my kids lost the nail clippers. Since then I tried all the locally available clippers without satisfaction. The Mehaz 660 really cuts easily and makes a good cut. The sliding guard that is supposed to catch the clippings actually works but I found it hard to get used to since it affects how close you can get to your finger. However, if it bothers you just slide it out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended. (I hide it from the kids, though).</li>
            <li> Well crafted, solid feel and amazing precision in cutting.  Almost too good - you really have to pay attention when trying to cut your nails.  Few burrs on your nails so hardly need a nail file to finish trim.  But wet/damp hands and it&#x27;s hard to keep a grip.</li>
            <li> This clipper clips very cleanly, it&#x27;s better than a regular clipper. I was skeptical but plan to buy more of these in the future.</li>
            <li> Recommended for those looking for KAI products.&lt;br /&gt;KAI and MEHAZ probably is like the same brand.&lt;br /&gt;Good simple design.&lt;br /&gt;Good price.&lt;br /&gt;Good working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*.Summary: I like this.</li>
            <li> Ineffective: the clipper was very difficult to maneuver, and when I finally got it where it needed to be, the cutting process left my nails jagged and sharp. I could have done a better job with my cheapo clipper, or my teeth, or maybe a can opener.</li>
            <li> Wirecutter recommended this as the &amp;#34;best nail clippers.&amp;#34;  I was very skeptical since the price seems a little ridiculous.  Although I still don&#x27;t like the price, they are the best nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever used.  I feel like it ALWAYS makes smooth, clean cuts, never any tearing.</li>
            <li> Like a surgical instrument these clippers work better than any that I have purchased before.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality product with one exception. I found it unwieldly and overly sharp.  Sounds like an oxy-moron - a cutter that is too sharp?  I found it hard to angle round the mail and the cut was extremely sharp and left edges. Not worth the extra money over a standard clipper.</li>
            <li> I love this because it is so easy to use, great for my hand size and very strong and durable.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this clipper.  I was looking for one that is sharp enough for tough nails and made well.  This one fits all of my requirements so I am happy that I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> Not a bad clipper but not finished as well nor cuts as well as my Feather Parada clipper which was made in Japan. This one says made in Vietnam. As previously mentioned, the two cutting edges do not meet perfectly so you&#x27;re not going to get a super clean cut. Still, better than the stuff you get at the drugstore hence the 3 stars.</li>
            <li> The plastic-wrapped-around feature is quite nice to hold all the nail, but it sometimes gets in the way if I want to turn it to cut bits and bites. Plus, it&#x27;s a bit on the large side and not always snappy.</li>
            <li> I normally buy just a drug store nail clipper.  Always felt that there&#x27;s got to be something better and something sharper.  After all these great Amazon reviews, I took the plunge and pay double what I normally pay.  I was disappointed from day one.  The blade seems to be mis-aligned or something (but it&#x27;s not) and I get a secondary click when I cut.  This generally happens to cheap nail clippers that has no quality control.  It still cuts my nails fine so I lived with this annoying click.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the nails fly out of the gap in the corner of the clipping catcher.  Most nails fly out.  It&#x27;s almost as if there&#x27;s no catcher at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, it&#x27;s perfect size for finger nails, but not so much for toe nails.  It&#x27;s a bit too small for the toe nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, and this might be me.  The nail clipper is not strong enough to cut my toe nails without a lot more effort than normal.  It could be that this clipper is just too small and there&#x27;s not enough leverage to cut properly.</li>
            <li> I must confess - I&#x27;m not a professional nail clipper. However, if I was, I would definitely buy these clippers. Twice. My nails have been so happy with me ever since I bought them. Most of the clippings are caught in the clear rubber sleeve and the few that aren&#x27;t just fall straight down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FanTAStic clippers!!!</li>
            <li> Nice clippers, &#x27;nuff said.  They are the small/medium size typical nail clippers (not the big ones you use for toes).</li>
            <li> Great tool functions as described, Performs clear cut and stays sharp much better quality than what one can find in a regular drugstore.</li>
            <li> For three months I&#x27;ve used this clipper for regular personal hygiene and to cut loose threads from cloths. I use it around 5 times a month&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;- Durability You can put it in your junk drawer and it&#x27;ll wear much slower than an average grocery store clipper&lt;br /&gt;- Weight, it has a nice heavy feel to it&lt;br /&gt;- Warranty&lt;br /&gt;- Cuts like it should&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;- The catcher doesn&#x27;t catch</li>
            <li> These have so many positive reviews for a reason.  I&#x27;ve always wanted quality nail clippers and I&#x27;m happy I picked these after some research.  I have normal nail thickness and I cut both my fingernails and toenails with these easily.  I don&#x27;t use the nail catcher feature so I can&#x27;t attest to it&#x27;s functionality but otherwise these are the best.  If I lost it I&#x27;d by another one!</li>
            <li> Better for fingers than toenails.</li>
            <li> This is a good clipper, would recommend buying it. Not made in Japan, as some of the other reviewers mentioned, made in Vietnam</li>
            <li> These clippers are amazing.  I never knew clipping nails could be so easy but with the Mehaz clippers your nails are clipped at the softest touch and the nail catcher works really well.</li>
            <li> Wanted one with a wider opening</li>
            <li> I may have led a sheltered life, however these are without a doubt the nicest fingernail clippers I have ever used and/or had used on me by professionals in a salon.  Extremely sharp blades that are aligned exactly to the correct point - a very smooth operating lever and the nail catcher works.  Very nice product that I would recommend without exception.</li>
            <li> I had better luck with the Seki Edge Deluxe Toenail Clipper.  This one just feels too flimsy when you have larger hands.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time. Sharp and seems durable</li>
            <li> The nail clipper, aMehaz 660 purchased at Amazon, is as good as any on the market and better than most,  It is advertised as having a wider opening clipper but it&#x27;s clippr jaw is similar to most models.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this!  Comments how wonderful it is every time she uses it.</li>
            <li> They work perfectly well as nail clippers. They&#x27;re not great for keeping on a key ring and putting in your pocket. They don&#x27;t stay closed well.</li>
            <li> Thank you sweet home review.  These finger and toe nail clippers are excellent.  Received them today and immediately tested.  I gave this a 5 only because I have not used them for long, but will update later.</li>
            <li> very small, did not cut my nails was more like breaking them. feels pretty cheap to me. would not recommend</li>
            <li> Hard to use. Very large.</li>
            <li> This is the best that I saw after extensive shopping.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the description said it was better than the usual nail clipper but was disappointed to find out that it&#x27;s just like all the rest. No sharper no more efficient in anyway. I guess I&#x27;ll have to keep looking</li>
            <li> I love these nail clippers.  Don&#x27;t waste your time on the cheap clippers, spend a couple extra dollars and put a smile on your face.</li>
            <li> Very sharp clippers, get the job done.</li>
            <li> I thought this one would finally be the answer for me, but, alas, it is not.  It does not make a smooth cut.  The nail always has to be filed afterwards.  Not worth the price!</li>
            <li> I always get nail clippers for the men in my life as stocking stuffers for xmas and these were the best ones I ever found.</li>
            <li> These are without a doubt the best fingernail clippers I have ever used. They have a bullet proof construction and the built in fingernail clipper catch works great. They are extremely sharp and cut even the thickest nails to include toe nails. You can&#x27;t go wrong with these.</li>
            <li> These are really nice. Extremely sharp. You don’t even hear a click when the nail cuts, it just silently slices through.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this clipper; it doesn&#x27;t have a wide enough opening to cut thick toenails.&lt;br /&gt;Buy the Mehaz wide jaw slant edge clipper instead; we bought one of each and we wish we could return this one.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this nail clipper, I had no idea how small it was.  It was small!!!  Maybe I didn&#x27;t completely read the description, but I do not remember if the description had the size or not?  Either way, it is not the standard size nail clipper that I was expecting.</li>
            <li> My husband has arthritis in his thumbs, and needed a nail clipper design that was comfortable and easy to use clipping his nails. This is excellent!</li>
            <li> Excellent clippers -- sturdy and well-made.</li>
            <li> I bought these on a recommendation from &amp;#34;The Sweet Home&amp;#34; website, and they are good, but not as sharp as I had hoped. I have to take the plastic &amp;#34;nail catcher&amp;#34; off to use it, and after I clip I have to use the file (on the back of the plastic sheath) to make sure my nails are even and smooth. I get a good result, but as a guy it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;ve ever been used to. They are good, not great.</li>
            <li> Nail clipper works flawlessly. Clean cut, easy to use, sharp. The packaging the product comes in is by far the stupidest packaging in the world. You have to be a structural designer by day, serial killer by night to open this monstrosity. Who was the jerk who thought this was a good idea?</li>
            <li> I bought these because they stated the manufacturer was the same as Shun knives (which i love and own).&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, they just are not the quality i was looking for</li>
            <li> This is really a much better sharper and durable clipper I ever owned. I like it a lot. It may be more expensive from the ones at the $ store, however, you et what you pay for and this one is a big quality.</li>
            <li> Great nail clippers! My nails have honestly never felt so nice after cutting them!</li>
            <li> These things are sharp, and produce crisp cuts on my finger and toenails. I hope they stay this sharp for a while, but I can&#x27;t imagine them ever getting as dull as the cheap drugstore ones I used to use.</li>
            <li> Total garbage. I&#x27;m not happy with these at all. They split the layers of my nails when they cut. What looks like it might be a clean cut very quickly turns in to having to deal with all these snages and split layers. Have never had a problem like this with nail clippers before. Truly awful product.</li>
            <li> I was willing to pay a little more for clippers that would last a lifetime.  These did not disappoint.  Excellent construction.  Nice quality of metal.  Sharp clean cutting edge.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Much higher quality than my other clippers.</li>
            <li> Well manufactured product, but somehow it leaves one side of my nails rough (the side toward the bottom of the clipper).  Also, I find it awkward to use with the plastic casing, so I have removed it.  Without the casing, there is no file attached to the clipper, but the file it comes with is annoying anyway.  The file is dull and inset from the edge of the plastic, making it hard to get under nails or into the corners.</li>
            <li> They might cost a lot more than the 99 cent ones at Walgreens or CVS but they are worth every penny.  Extremely sharp and so far they&#x27;ve held that edge.  Sometimes the plastic container doesn&#x27;t catch everything but that&#x27;s no big deal at all.  If you want a well built nail clipper this is one you should consider.</li>
            <li> The clipper looked like a strong, sharp nail clipper...but as soon as I took my first clip I knew looks were deceiving. Additionally, the main reason I bought the nail clipper was for the nail catcher, and sadly the holder is only large enough to hold the tiniest of clippings.</li>
