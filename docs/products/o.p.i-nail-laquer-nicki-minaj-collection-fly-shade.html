            <li>I am so pleased with this color</li>
            <li>It is perfect for blue lovers.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;2 coats needed for full opacity!</li>
            <li>I searched high and low for the perfect turquoise.</li>
            <li>OPI-Fly is such a gorgeous teal cr&amp;egrave;me polish, from the nicki minaj collection.  </li>
            <li>QUICK</li>
            <li>Great color and dry fast.</li>
            <li>It shipped quickly and was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The color goes on exactly like it looks in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t to dark or bright; a very flattering shade.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Smooth solid color without any sparkle.</li>
            <li>I remove the teal stains (or any nail polish stain for that matter) from my nails by applying some whitening toothpaste on them and leaving it on for five minutes and &amp;#34;voila&amp;#34; my nails return to being white and pretty as can be.  ;)</li>
            <li>It is very pretty, especially for the summer.  </li>

            <li>Preference - not one of my favorites, but either is Nicki Minaj :-o</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t too bad and when I opened up the package the bottle was wrapped pretty well in bubble wrap which made me happy because I was a little worried about having finger nail polish shipped.</li>
            <li>I am currently wearing it in the Fall/Winter months and it is dark enough to blend with my winter wardrobe, but also fun enough to add a pop of color to any outfit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> It is pretty thick</li>
            <li> The formula is phenomenal, fully opaque in two thin coats, could definitely be a one coater with a thicker coat, I prefer two thin coats tho.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple of different base coats with this polish and it still manages to seep through and stain my nails.  </li>
            <li> am giving it four stars because it does stain the nails a little, but not too bad.  </li>
            <li> I said it once ill say it again.</li>
            <li> Maybe not the longest-lasting but not too bad either!</li>
