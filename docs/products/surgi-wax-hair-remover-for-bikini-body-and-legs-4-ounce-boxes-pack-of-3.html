            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>and it was great.</li>
            <li>I use it for at-home bikini waxes, and I&#x27;ve been extremely happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>I use this for my daughters&#x27; and my eyebrows and it works great.</li>
            <li>If you have the patience to work with this or are used to waxing it is probably a good product for you, if not maybe try something else.</li>
            <li>I have been using this wax for years now and have always loved the product and raved to friends about it</li>
            <li>Good price.  </li>
            <li>I love Amazon and surgi wax is a great product It is easy to use and goes on great.</li>
            <li>All SURGI Wax products are amazing.</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of heating the wax in the microwave.</li>
            <li>Great to have this item, it&#x27;s very useful, nice for all activities, nice for me and should be nice for every one as well</li>
            <li>so trying to put your finger underneath to get a good grip will pull at any surrounding hairs so dont worry about a good grip just quickly pul</li>
            <li>Easy as that!</li>
            <li>For  those who do their own facial waxing, this is the best product on the market.  </li>
            <li>After trying about 10 different wax products, this is the best one on the market.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and would buy again.</li>
            <li>thats my review :)</li>
            <li>There is an art to getting the wax applied properly, figuring out the best temperature for application, knowing when to pull it off, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t heat it up more to minimize &#x27;reheats&#x27; or you&#x27;ll risk burning yourself.</li>
            <li>Been using Surgi Wax, for face, for many yrs.</li>
            <li>The best thing is the used pieces can be placed back into the jar and used over and over.</li>
            <li>My favorite.  </li>
            <li>The texture was more like gum than melted wax.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still looking for a better product.</li>
            <li>Sceptical, I read the instructions which said to liberally apply powder (not included) to area to be waxed to soak up any excess moisture and help hair stick better to wax.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Four more words required.  </li>
            <li>No messy muslin strips are needed and that is great.  </li>
            <li>The heating process was ok, you need a hot plate to keep it warm though because otherwise you&#x27;ll be visiting the microwave every 3 minutes or so.</li>
            <li>Pros: it was not very painful and effectively removed hair  </li>
            <li>So easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t burn my skin at all, it didn&#x27;t even feel hot just warm.     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been waxed professionally &amp; done it at home successfully as well.</li>
            <li>(but Bliss is a better product -- gentler on skin, easier to get to the right temp, easier to see on the skin, easier to remove . . . ).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to receive this to try out on my legs, lip area, and my privates.  </li>
            <li>I threw a full jar in the trash</li>
            <li>Works good for facial hair.</li>
            <li>Received a good tip from customers reviews stating the body wax, which comes in a much  larger size, can also be used for the face.  </li>
            <li>All of the wax builds up on the edge of the jar because that is where the instructions tell you to wipe it off and it hardens quickly.</li>
            <li>Just hardens to quickly.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I had powder</li>
            <li>Trying not to panick, I ran and grabbed some coconut oil I luckily had and rubbed it on the wax to try to get off.</li>
            <li>I used this produst and it cleanly pulls out the hair down to to the follicle very nice</li>
            <li>You will save lots of money just on the first jar!  </li>
            <li>its fine for face as well and frankly its better than the ones the market for face only.</li>
            <li>I agree that it does tend to cool very fast.</li>
            <li>Like all wax, though, room temperature determines success with removal.</li>
            <li>and then you peel the wax right off.</li>
            <li>I have tried several different kinds of wax hair removal and this is by far the easiest, cleanest, and best to use.</li>
            <li>Surgi Wax is easy to use, no mess.  </li>
            <li>i can even slowly pull the wac off and still get the follicles wouldn&#x27;t suggest it tho that will hurt lol anyways</li>
            <li>With my microwave, it can be a challenge to get it melted without getting it too hot</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was expecting</li>
            <li>so I did exactly as instructed.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, quick microwave to heat it- usually 1-2 minutes and easy to apply and remove.  </li>
            <li>So, I did and was able to wax without too much further incident; however, the wax still never seemed to really harden as I remember it.</li>
            <li>(of course, that&#x27;s easily fixed by letting it cool).</li>
            <li>Just make sure the area is completely dry.</li>
            <li>it really forms well on the skin and takes the hairs out effortlessly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brand for years and was delighted to find it on Amazon and at half the price of my local drug store.  </li>
            <li>This brand is a little more finicky than others, though.</li>
            <li>This is a  more economical purchase and will certainly last  a few years.</li>
            <li>NO more unwanted hair ever again:)</li>
            <li>My one complaint is that if the room is warm it doesn&#x27;t get hard and cannot be removed easily.</li>
            <li>The box says not to heat for more than 60 seconds and mine was still hard as a rock after a minute.</li>
            <li>the only reason i couldnt give it a 5 was i had to go over the same spot in order to get all the hair but its so pain free compaired to getting a regular wax that you wont mind.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t know why this is marked body wax.</li>
            <li>Once the jar is less than 1/4 full, don&#x27;t bother with the rest.  </li>
            <li>No mess at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several wax strips and soft wax kits that were much more painful and ineffective (most of the time they grabbed virtually no hair).</li>
            <li>I ended up putting it in a small glass bowl that would fit on the heater of my coffee maker.</li>
            <li>Have to work fast to keep it from cooling off to much and then if you use it a little warmer it burns you.</li>
            <li>Each box of wax was missing the post wax wipes and the applicators were different, replaced with cheap ones.</li>
            <li>I was ready to chuck my jar of wax in the trash when I decided to give it one last chance and went back to what I knew...</li>
            <li>Then the areas I was able to pull off in one strip only took off about half the hair on my leg!!!</li>
            <li>I credit the relative painlessness of it to the fact that it doesn&#x27;t stick to skin like a soft wax does.</li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t stay soft enough to spread.  </li>
            <li>The wax didn&#x27;t seem to harden very well, either which made it even harder to peel off.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever had to go over the same area twice, and usually only a few hairs are left, which are loosened and come out easily with tweezers.  </li>
            <li>It seemed to stay gooey even after applying as thin a layer as possible and waiting more than a minute.</li>
            <li>The was got hard too quickly, and turned brittle almost instantly.</li>

            <li> I was ready to chuck my jar of wax in the trash when I decided to give it one last chance and went back to what I knew...</li>
            <li> Then the areas I was able to pull off in one strip only took off about half the hair on my leg!!!</li>
            <li> I credit the relative painlessness of it to the fact that it doesn&#x27;t stick to skin like a soft wax does.</li>

            <li> It seemed to stay gooey even after applying as thin a layer as possible and waiting more than a minute.</li>
            <li> The was got hard too quickly, and turned brittle almost instantly.</li>
            <li> my very first impression was that this product was easy to use and not as painful as some waxing seems to be, But within minutes it becomes a mess.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money, not sticky and messy like the cold waxes and honey waxes, no cloth strips, no bad smell.....</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wait too long to pull it off (flick up the edge and remove as soon as the wax</li>
            <li> but I assume the salon gets every thing within 2 tries in the same area....</li>
            <li> Much less expensive and more convenient than a salon.</li>
            <li> It grabbed a substantial amount of hair in one stroke, but areas did have to be redone (could be due to various directions of growth rather than ineffectiveness of the product though).</li>
            <li> This is super easy and the pain was much less than with other products (using a pretreatment I had from a Nad&#x27;s kit made it less painful than ripping off a bandaid, and when I used Nad&#x27;s it felt like I hadn&#x27;t used any pretreatment).</li>
            <li> I give this product a 5 because not only is it a clever was to wax without needing the strips but also it&#x27;s no where near as painful as regular waxing</li>
            <li> Much less messy than soft wax/muslin strip combo.</li>
            <li> A lot less expensive than Bliss Poetic</li>
            <li> It hurts like hell, not much hair came off.  </li>
            <li> New formula doesn&#x27;t come with the oil that goes on before the wax- much more painful without!!!  </li>
            <li> I suggest when u use this product when trying to grip on the wax before u pull it off completely can be a little painful because ir hair sticks very well</li>
            <li> Even bigger disappointment came when I had to get a new razor out</li>
            <li> (many of whom think I&#x27;m insane for doing my own Brazilian waxing); however, I am SO disappointed with the changes Surgi Wax has made.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;ve done waxing at home, I&#x27;ve used cotton muslin to remove wax rather previously.</li>
            <li> it is extremely messy and it gave me some kind of reaction to it I got a very bad rash everywhere</li>
            <li> Then it is just a mess</li>
            <li> What happened next can easily be classified as my WORST waxing experience EVER!  </li>
            <li> This was the biggest waste of money.</li>
            <li> A few tips:&lt;br</li>
            <li> Had trouble heating the wax to start with.  </li>
            <li> Give it at least a few applications before you give up.  </li>
            <li> Do small sections at a time.  </li>
            <li> I usually do 1\\&quot;x1\\&quot;</li>
            <li> jar usually lasts me 2 bikini waxes, so I&#x27;ve saved literally hundreds of dollars compared to salon prices.</li>
            <li> and that there was no longer a small bottle of oil included.</li>
            <li> In the past, the instructions said to apply oil before waxing to keep wax from sticking to skin.</li>
            <li> The wax itself wasn&#x27;t too hard to put on</li>
            <li> This product is a nightmare, and if I could give negative 5 stars I would.</li>
            <li> &quot; (maybe my microwave sucks).</li>
            <li> so I decided to try this again, not remembering how much I hated it the first time.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I will be searching for a new wax to use. :(</li>
            <li> Absolutely the worst wax I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> The wax is messy and gets on everything and is nearly impossible to remove.  </li>
            <li> A bit of humidity leaves you with a stuck on painful mess.</li>
            <li> Cons: I found it difficult to work with    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe I did something wrong??</li>
            <li> This product was difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> I purchased another Surgi-wax Brazilian waxing kit and returned is since this product is so difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> This product is mediocre -</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s expensive for the size of the jar.  </li>
            <li> Not for the faint of heart- it does hurt a bit, but I prefer it to the strips.  </li>

            <li> After trying about 10 different wax products, this is the best one on the market. I have been using this one for 8+ years. I literally have nightmares of this one discontinuing so I always buy it in bulk. It&#x27;s super easy to use. No strips needed. Just apply the wax with the stick in the box and wait about 30 seconds for the wax to harden and then you peel the wax right off. Easy as that! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The best wax I ever got! So easy to use. No mess at all. NO more unwanted hair ever again:)</li>
            <li> This was the biggest waste of money. The was got hard too quickly, and turned brittle almost instantly. Thus, chunks of hardened wax on my leg. Then the areas I was able to pull off in one strip only took off about half the hair on my leg!!! Even bigger disappointment came when I had to get a new razor out so I could shave my legs, and whatever wax was remaining on my legs clogged the razor and ruined it! This product is a nightmare, and if I could give negative 5 stars I would.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no novice and I ran out of Nads on Christmas and am headed for the beach so I decided to try this again, not remembering how much I hated it the first time. It gets 1 hair out of 10 and leaves a lot of residue which cannot be washed, oiled or sanded off. My manicure will never be the same - I&#x27;m hoping the sand at the beach will finally wear it all off after 3 or 4 days. I threw a full jar in the trash and I&#x27;m so frugal I save tin cans.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several wax strips and soft wax kits that were much more painful and ineffective (most of the time they grabbed virtually no hair). This is super easy and the pain was much less than with other products (using a pretreatment I had from a Nad&#x27;s kit made it less painful than ripping off a bandaid, and when I used Nad&#x27;s it felt like I hadn&#x27;t used any pretreatment). I credit the relative painlessness of it to the fact that it doesn&#x27;t stick to skin like a soft wax does. Much less messy than soft wax/muslin strip combo. It grabbed a substantial amount of hair in one stroke, but areas did have to be redone (could be due to various directions of growth rather than ineffectiveness of the product though). Did need to be reheated during use, could be avoided if you bought a wax heater. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and would buy again.</li>
            <li> I give this product a 5 because not only is it a clever was to wax without needing the strips but also it&#x27;s no where near as painful as regular waxing it really forms well on the skin and takes the hairs out effortlessly. the only reason i couldnt give it a 5 was i had to go over the same spot in order to get all the hair but its so pain free compaired to getting a regular wax that you wont mind. I suggest when u use this product when trying to grip on the wax before u pull it off completely can be a little painful because ir hair sticks very well so trying to put your finger underneath to get a good grip will pull at any surrounding hairs so dont worry about a good grip just quickly pul what u can and opening under the wax will appear. I used this produst and it cleanly pulls out the hair down to to the follicle very nice i can even slowly pull the wac off and still get the follicles wouldn&#x27;t suggest it tho that will hurt lol anyways thats my review :).[[ASIN:B001A43ELC Surgi-wax Brazilian Waxing Kit For Private Parts, 4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 3)]]</li>
            <li> New formula doesn&#x27;t come with the oil that goes on before the wax- much more painful without!!!  It also didn&#x27;t come with the soothing lotion or the redness reducer they mention in the descriptions. Those things make a big difference!</li>
            <li> I used this when i was living in Spain and it was great. Bought the same thing here and it does not work the same.</li>
            <li> I bought this wax because it was going to be way cheaper than getting my legs done somewhere.  The wax is messy and gets on everything and is nearly impossible to remove.  I had to wax areas 2 or 3 times to remove the hair and it took me 4 days (working about 2-3 hours a day) to remove all the hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for years and was delighted to find it on Amazon and at half the price of my local drug store.  You should probably give yourself 3 or 4 uses to get the hang of it.  No messy muslin strips are needed and that is great.  Also, even though the box reads \\&quot;Bikini, body, &amp; Legs\\&quot;, it can be used on the face as well.  Well worth the money, not sticky and messy like the cold waxes and honey waxes, no cloth strips, no bad smell..... but waxing is a bit of a \\&quot;skill\\&quot; - if you&#x27;ve never done it before, allow yourself time to learn how.</li>
            <li> my very first impression was that this product was easy to use and not as painful as some waxing seems to be, But within minutes it becomes a mess. All of the wax builds up on the edge of the jar because that is where the instructions tell you to wipe it off and it hardens quickly. The box says not to heat for more than 60 seconds and mine was still hard as a rock after a minute. I heated it for almost 2.5 minutes before it became \\&quot;creamy\\&quot; (maybe my microwave sucks). It didn&#x27;t burn my skin at all, it didn&#x27;t even feel hot just warm.     Pros: it was not very painful and effectively removed hair  Cons: I found it difficult to work with    If you have the patience to work with this or are used to waxing it is probably a good product for you, if not maybe try something else.</li>
            <li> Works good for facial hair.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001A41BAS Surgi-wax Hair Remover For Bikini, Body &amp; Legs, 4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 3)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to receive this to try out on my legs, lip area, and my privates.  It hurts like hell, not much hair came off.  This is ineffective and painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I did something wrong??</li>
            <li> Efficient hair removal at drugstore price. With my microwave, it can be a challenge to get it melted without getting it too hot (of course, that&#x27;s easily fixed by letting it cool). A lot less expensive than Bliss Poetic (but Bliss is a better product -- gentler on skin, easier to get to the right temp, easier to see on the skin, easier to remove . . . ).</li>
            <li> Works great! Just hardens to quickly.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting</li>
            <li> This is my second reorder of this wax.  I use it for at-home bikini waxes, and I&#x27;ve been extremely happy with the results.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever had to go over the same area twice, and usually only a few hairs are left, which are loosened and come out easily with tweezers.  A few tips:&lt;br /&gt;1. Give it at least a few applications before you give up.  There is an art to getting the wax applied properly, figuring out the best temperature for application, knowing when to pull it off, etc.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Do small sections at a time.  I usually do 1\\&quot;x1\\&quot; sections.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Don&#x27;t wait too long to pull it off (flick up the edge and remove as soon as the wax hardens).&lt;br /&gt;4.  Once the jar is less than 1/4 full, don&#x27;t bother with the rest.  The wax doesn&#x27;t take well to being reheated multiple times -- it seems to lose its stickiness after a two or so reheats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A jar usually lasts me 2 bikini waxes, so I&#x27;ve saved literally hundreds of dollars compared to salon prices.</li>
            <li> This product was difficult to use.  It wouldn&#x27;t stay soft enough to spread.  Had trouble heating the wax to start with.  I purchased another Surgi-wax Brazilian waxing kit and returned is since this product is so difficult to use.  This product might work for someone who can use the wax faster than I but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to all users.  I have two unopened product since I can&#x27;t return since it came in a three pack.</li>
            <li> Each box of wax was missing the post wax wipes and the applicators were different, replaced with cheap ones. Dad</li>
            <li> Great to have this item, it&#x27;s very useful, nice for all activities, nice for me and should be nice for every one as well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waxed professionally &amp; done it at home successfully as well. This product is mediocre - I agree that it does tend to cool very fast. When I&#x27;ve done waxing at home, I&#x27;ve used cotton muslin to remove wax rather previously. Maybe that&#x27;s a trade-off for convenience of not using muslin. You can&#x27;t heat it up more to minimize &#x27;reheats&#x27; or you&#x27;ll risk burning yourself. I ended up putting it in a small glass bowl that would fit on the heater of my coffee maker. (Thank goodness no one saw me doing this!) Waxing is not like shaving - where you get &#x27;everything&#x27; in one stroke... there will be places you have to go back to.</li>
            <li> This stuff is crap! Absolutely the worst wax I&#x27;ve ever used! My daughter hates it too...I wish I could return it and get my $ back...it is extremely messy and it gave me some kind of reaction to it I got a very bad rash everywhere it was put on! It did not even remove all the hair! So do not buy! This &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; formula is just awful!</li>
            <li> Been using Surgi Wax, for face, for many yrs. and it&#x27;s expensive for the size of the jar.  Received a good tip from customers reviews stating the body wax, which comes in a much  larger size, can also be used for the face.  This is a  more economical purchase and will certainly last  a few years. Surgi Wax is easy to use, no mess.  The best thing is the used pieces can be placed back into the jar and used over and over.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know why this is marked body wax. its fine for face as well and frankly its better than the ones the market for face only.</li>
            <li> I use this for my daughters&#x27; and my eyebrows and it works great. I have tried several different kinds of wax hair removal and this is by far the easiest, cleanest, and best to use.</li>
            <li> I have been using this wax for years. I like it because you just heat it and use it and no strips needed. Just make sure the area is completely dry. My one complaint is that if the room is warm it doesn&#x27;t get hard and cannot be removed easily. Then it is just a mess</li>
            <li> Have to work fast to keep it from cooling off to much and then if you use it a little warmer it burns you.</li>
            <li> My favorite.  I cannot find it in stores so I must be in the minority.  Not for the faint of heart- it does hurt a bit, but I prefer it to the strips.  Much less expensive and more convenient than a salon.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of heating the wax in the microwave. But not 15 or 20 times for one leg. The texture was more like gum than melted wax. It irritated my skin a lot.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve never gone to a salon to be waxed but I assume the salon gets every thing within 2 tries in the same area.... The heating process was ok, you need a hot plate to keep it warm though because otherwise you&#x27;ll be visiting the microwave every 3 minutes or so. The wax itself wasn&#x27;t too hard to put on but it didn&#x27;t get my leg hairs too well. It would get some but definitely not what I thought it&#x27;d get. It works on the bikini area though. I wouldn&#x27;t get it again, but it works in some areas. I&#x27;m still looking for a better product.</li>
            <li> I love Amazon and surgi wax is a great product It is easy to use and goes on great. I would recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> I have been using this wax for years now and have always loved the product and raved to friends about it (many of whom think I&#x27;m insane for doing my own Brazilian waxing); however, I am SO disappointed with the changes Surgi Wax has made. When I opened the box, I immediately noticed there was an extra stick I&#x27;d never seen before (I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s for stirring the wax?) and that there was no longer a small bottle of oil included. In the past, the instructions said to apply oil before waxing to keep wax from sticking to skin. It always worked like a charm. Sceptical, I read the instructions which said to liberally apply powder (not included) to area to be waxed to soak up any excess moisture and help hair stick better to wax. Luckily, I had powder so I did exactly as instructed. What happened next can easily be classified as my WORST waxing experience EVER!  The wax did NOT want to peel away from my skin and stuck like glue. The wax didn&#x27;t seem to harden very well, either which made it even harder to peel off. Trying not to panick, I ran and grabbed some coconut oil I luckily had and rubbed it on the wax to try to get off. Even with the oil, I had to literally scrape the wax from my skin. It was like trying to remove gum from my skin/hair. I was ready to chuck my jar of wax in the trash when I decided to give it one last chance and went back to what I knew...apply oil to skin before waxing. So, I did and was able to wax without too much further incident; however, the wax still never seemed to really harden as I remember it. It seemed to stay gooey even after applying as thin a layer as possible and waiting more than a minute. Such a hassle. Needless to say, I will be searching for a new wax to use. :(</li>
            <li> I love this product. Like all wax, though, room temperature determines success with removal. This brand is a little more finicky than others, though. A bit of humidity leaves you with a stuck on painful mess.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Good price.  You will save lots of money just on the first jar!  Four more words required.  There!</li>
            <li> All SURGI Wax products are amazing.</li>
            <li> For  those who do their own facial waxing, this is the best product on the market.  Easy to use, quick microwave to heat it- usually 1-2 minutes and easy to apply and remove.  Apply the wax and then press over the spot with a paper towel, pull in the opposite direction of hair growth and voila! No hair!</li>
