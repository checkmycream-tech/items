            <li>Love them...</li>
            <li>love the variety.....</li>
            <li>will def buy more :)</li>
            <li>I was so pleased with the number decals.</li>
            <li>I tried using tweezers, toothpicks, anything I could find but ended up ruining more than I was able to put on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like the top coat didn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li>I wonder if there is some sort of oil that prevents the top coat from covering them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was going to give some to my niece since there are so many, but they don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I am in love with these stickers.</li>
            <li>I have bought many decals by this brand</li>
            <li>Will update more when received for quality...</li>
            <li>Love the variety.</li>
            <li>Very special.</li>
            <li>As with all decals for your nails you need to put a nice top coat over them with good top coat and it takes a little stronger polish remover to get them off.  </li>
            <li>i bough them for gifts when i go overseas and know everyone will enjoy them.</li>
            <li>These are fabulous stickers.</li>
            <li>There are so many fun ones to chose from.</li>
            <li>Tweezers required as well as a top coat to get it right.</li>
            <li>some are perfect for little pinky nails, like mine!  </li>
            <li>will buy more, Thanks!</li>
            <li>Super cheap.</li>
            <li>This is a great buy, but you have to be careful with the decals.  </li>
            <li>I also love the fact that I have so many different designs from which to choose.</li>
            <li>EZ  and quick to put on</li>
            <li>They are on the &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; side, so they tear easy and they don&#x27;t stick very well.  </li>
            <li>Have fun.</li>
            <li>Just be sure, with any nail decal, that you finish with a clear coat, or they will rub off...</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I took a couple off right away and stuck them to my nail...</li>
            <li>These are pretty.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, they had a funny odor.</li>
            <li>Love all the different stickers!</li>
            <li>The colors were exactly as I saw from online sale picture.  </li>
            <li>love these the only issue is that you need to put them on your nails before you put any polish on your nail...</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll have to be gentle peeling them off the sheet</li>
            <li>so you have to gently remove them.</li>
            <li>I really like the decals since all I have to do is peel and stick - no water involved.  </li>
            <li>It smelled up my whole house.</li>
            <li>They came so fast (11 days).</li>
            <li>very nice..hard to get of sheeting though would not buy again..</li>
            <li>Took much longer to arrive than expected, but overall very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>When I put top coat over them quite a few of them curled up</li>
            <li>I put them on over my dried bottom coat/color, and then put on TWO top coats</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re careful and use a couple layers of clear coat, they work just fine.  </li>
            <li>There were so few of these, compared to sheets that were fine, that I did not care.</li>
            <li>this was a NICE thing for me, actually, because I have very petite nail beds, so it is sometimes hard to find nail stickers smaller...</li>
            <li>These are really too tiny for me.  </li>
            <li>It often does NOT look professional.</li>
            <li>only thing is the chemical smell when you first open the package.....</li>
            <li>Be VERY careful getting stickers off of paper because they do tear slightly easier than normal ones that I buy at the store HOWEVER considering the price which is what you pay to get like a 10 piece at Walmart of cheap looking kiddish ones</li>
            <li>I have a slight tremor in my hands and they are pretty tricky for me.  </li>
            <li>Small and large, look like you went and had them professionally painted on.</li>
            <li>There are a few sheets that I think are cheesy or that I will probably never use, but on a whole I love them.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Second, it is difficult to remove a decal from the plastic without ripping it.</li>
            <li> The sheets are REALLY small, but do not confuse that for lack of stickers, etc... remember your nails are small, so the photos have to zoom in there...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am very unhappy and disappointed because the decals are very cute and versatile.</li>
            <li> they are not cheaply made!!</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t even use a base coat because they will start peeling off.</li>
            <li> They smell horrible and are difficult to peel off!!!  </li>
            <li> we are brutal with our hands!  </li>

Lots to choose from and good variety, excellent value for the price. You&#x27;ll have to be gentle peeling them off the sheet but they stick, look, and stay on great.</li>
            <li> These are pretty. I got 49 sheets instead of 50. And I&#x27;ve noticed that some are more difficult to get off of the sheet and will tear if you don&#x27;t remove them with extreme caution. When I put top coat over them quite a few of them curled up and I had to use tweezers to poke them back down. But for the price it&#x27;s still a good buy, and I would&#x27;ve given five stars if I had received 50 sheets.</li>
            <li> These are really too tiny for me.  I have a slight tremor in my hands and they are pretty tricky for me.  Others, I think, will like them a lot.</li>
            <li> I love these stickers. They are thinner so you have to gently remove them. But they stick great to my nails with a top coat. They are a nice size for my nails. My nails are slightly on the smaller size. But a great find. They do smell like plastic but once they are laid out it goes away. Very happy</li>
            <li> I like these for my nails and for my youngest daughter.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in good shape and on time.  I really like the decals since all I have to do is peel and stick - no water involved.  I also love the fact that I have so many different designs from which to choose.</li>
            <li> love them all lots to choose from</li>
            <li> Easy to use and nice designs.  Have no painting ability so these are perfect for me.  Tweezers required as well as a top coat to get it right.</li>
            <li> This was part of a gift for my granddaughter</li>
            <li> Many designs.  Very special.</li>
            <li> Love them... they are not cheaply made!! love the variety..... only thing is the chemical smell when you first open the package..... after letting them air out I started using them.... they look great!! will def buy more :)</li>
            <li> This is a great value. This has a good selection in it. It was a ton of them. I was so pleased with the number decals. It does have chemical odor to them when you open them, but they air out after you open them. As with all decals for your nails you need to put a nice top coat over them with good top coat and it takes a little stronger polish remover to get them off.  I was very pleased.</li>
            <li> These are great very happy i got them ! so many designs to choose from! will buy more, Thanks!</li>

            <li> I received these about 3 weeks after placing the order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, they had a funny odor. Second, it is difficult to remove a decal from the plastic without ripping it. I tried using tweezers, toothpicks, anything I could find but ended up ruining more than I was able to put on. Lastly, they fall off. I put them on over my dried bottom coat/color, and then put on TWO top coats and they came off the next day in the shower. It&#x27;s like the top coat didn&#x27;t matter. I wonder if there is some sort of oil that prevents the top coat from covering them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very unhappy and disappointed because the decals are very cute and versatile. I was going to give some to my niece since there are so many, but they don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This is a great buy, but you have to be careful with the decals.  They are on the &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; side, so they tear easy and they don&#x27;t stick very well.  If you&#x27;re careful and use a couple layers of clear coat, they work just fine.  No matter what, this is an awesome deal.</li>
            <li> Stickers just as described. Very happy with my purchase :-)</li>
            <li> These stickers came from China, took forever. When I got them they were covered in a sticky oil each sheet. It smelled up my whole house. I had to throw them out. This is the sellers fault, Amazon helped. I am warning you so it won&#x27;t happen to you.</li>
            <li> They look great once you get them on your nails. But they tear very easily you just gotta be careful with them.</li>
            <li> I am in love with these stickers. they are easy to use and look nice on the nails.  you can create masterpieces.  i bough them for gifts when i go overseas and know everyone will enjoy them.</li>
            <li> Love all the different stickers! And hey for the price this deserves 6 stars!</li>
            <li> As always Zeagoo makes great decals with fantastic detail.  I have bought many decals by this brand and I am always amazed at the intricate detail. One decal can go on a nail or make a design that coordinates on the nail or the hand.  Have fun.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality product and arrived before estimated time of arrival! </li>
            <li> Nice Designs EZ  and quick to put on</li>
            <li> I have yet to receive them, but for anyone not wanting to get these because of 17-28 day waiting time, I say go ahead and take the chance... it might be defaut times for that area, only... my est. arrival date is not till March 6th.... but I just looked at the tracking info (yes! It has tracking!) and it says my package is already in San Francisco... I am in San Diego... I should be getting in hours compared to days... days compared to weeks, for sure!  Will update more when received for quality... but for the price and delivery time, I am guessing I will have no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/18/14... recvd nail stickers! They came so fast (11 days). The sheets are REALLY small, but do not confuse that for lack of stickers, etc... remember your nails are small, so the photos have to zoom in there... this was a NICE thing for me, actually, because I have very petite nail beds, so it is sometimes hard to find nail stickers smaller... these are perfect... some are perfect for little pinky nails, like mine!  I took a couple off right away and stuck them to my nail... they adhered nicely!  They were also very easy to remove from backing.  Just be sure, with any nail decal, that you finish with a clear coat, or they will rub off... we are brutal with our hands!  There are soooo many of them I literally plucked out some to give to friends!  The price was awesome, too... I did have a few sheets of colored ones, where it seemed on some of the decals, the pattern or color was &#x27;rubbed off.&#x27;  There were so few of these, compared to sheets that were fine, that I did not care. The colors were exactly as I saw from online sale picture.  Some of the sheets might stick together, too... just rub them between your fingers to seperate.... no biggie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend.</li>
            <li> These are fabulous stickers. There are so many fun ones to chose from. My best friend comes over and does her nails every time she comes to my house. There are a few sheets that I think are cheesy or that I will probably never use, but on a whole I love them. Worth every penny. And I paid less than 5 bucks for then</li>
            <li> very nice..hard to get of sheeting though would not buy again..</li>
            <li> love these the only issue is that you need to put them on your nails before you put any polish on your nail...you can&#x27;t even use a base coat because they will start peeling off.</li>
            <li> I would agree with kitty momma&#x27;s review.  They smell horrible and are difficult to peel off!!!  I would not buy these again.</li>
            <li> Ordered these on the 8th of March and already received them! Can&#x27;t wait to use them. Love the variety.</li>
