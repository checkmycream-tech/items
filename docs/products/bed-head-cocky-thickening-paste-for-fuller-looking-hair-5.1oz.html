            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I imagine it&#x27;s amazing for people with coarser, thicker hair than my baby fines.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve found I can use this product more effectively.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>I like to use it before blowdrying to give it more oomph.</li>
            <li>I just love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I really love it.</li>
            <li>Always my go to product for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I found it worked best on damp towel dried hair.</li>
            <li>Love, love love this product and have tried so many different products and not one compares.  </li>
            <li>Cocky hair paste is perfect for wanting a fuller head of hair.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for styling hair, especially for those of us that don&#x27;t have too much of it.</li>
            <li>However, both products arrived super fast.</li>
            <li>A bit more expensive than drug-store products but really really great.</li>
            <li>I use a dime sized amount on my super short hair (Making sure not to add too much to the roots or else it&#x27;ll look like you haven&#x27;t washed your hair in days).</li>
            <li>and I have not found a better product to give my hair style the final touch to adding thickness and holding a style for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have really thick hair and wanted something that would make my hair style &amp;#34;spike up&amp;#34; and this product worked great.</li>
            <li>I have tried other similar ones but this is definitely the best.</li>
            <li>Neither of these products really did that for me.  </li>
            <li>It works sometimes, but really depends on hair.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes very sticky and clumpy.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t see a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>With a bit of work you can really add volume to your hair.</li>
            <li>My real test will happen after the perm is just about gone.</li>
            <li>My hair is straight with no body to it.  </li>
            <li>If you use too much of this product it will make your hair look &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>There is PVP and petrolatum in the ingredients which may have coated my hair too much.</li>
            <li>I must purchase more in the near future just to stock up.</li>
            <li>My hair looks exactly the same, it just doesn&#x27;t move as much.  </li>
            <li>Other products at one fourth the price and work so much better.</li>
            <li>I bought this product based on the stellar reviews of those with fine hair who claim it made their hair thick and textured.</li>
            <li>but if you have fine hair that needs body, you should sample it somewhere before you waste the $</li>
            <li>I now use more of it (dime sized dollop for short hair) and massage it deeply at roots and then blow dry completely, and then some.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have a hard time with hair products...always looking for items to give me more volume.  </li>
            <li>I can actually get some decent body with this product but it leaves my hair too silky, which defeats the purpose for me.</li>
            <li>Provides great control and feels and looks as though actually thickens hair, the only problem is product has gotten ridiculously expensive.</li>
            <li>By using a nickel size portion of cocky on wet hair and combed through gives your hair body that you will love.  </li>
            <li>I then blow dry on hot at low speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> It actually made my hair flat and overly silky.</li>
            <li> Last a long time.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to use too much because your hair will have a greasy look to it after it is dried.</li>
            <li> apparently wasn&#x27;t use enough before and leaving my hair a little damp.</li>
            <li> As far as the thickening I am still not sure on this as I haven&#x27;t used the product but a few times since I have a fairly new perm.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product is old or what</li>
            <li> You can use it on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I use it on my hair when it is dry and only use a very small amount (about the size of a pea because my hair if fairly short).</li>
            <li> Tube lasts about a year because you only use very little.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it, because of the odd smell.</li>
            <li> This product does create volume but it is very firm and somewhat sticky and you have to use in small amounts and definiteloy wash out the next day.</li>
            <li> the roots, scruff it up just a little, and style.</li>
            <li> I could put this stuff on in the morning and go out after work, scruff my hair up a little</li>
            <li> /&gt;a few years now.</li>
            <li> Cocky helps me to manage my hair.</li>
            <li> Too bad TIGI not smart enough to keep on the market or doesn&#x27;t have another product that works similarly.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint to all of the hair stylists I&#x27;ve had in my lifetime is my flat, thin hair.</li>
            <li> I recently got this product, and have tried using a few different ways with very disappointing results.  </li>
            <li> Small amount&lt;br</li>
            <li> Woule have given five stars if not for the ridiculous pricing.</li>
            <li> but it did have a peculiar smell like an outdated product.</li>
            <li> Waaaaaaay too expensive</li>
            <li> Too bad it has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed!</li>

            <li> I love this stuff!  Works great!!</li>
            <li> I have a hard time with hair products...always looking for items to give me more volume.  Neither of these products really did that for me.  However, both products arrived super fast. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the service from the sellers.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year and I have not found a better product to give my hair style the final touch to adding thickness and holding a style for my hair.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint to all of the hair stylists I&#x27;ve had in my lifetime is my flat, thin hair. I always wanted it to be big &amp; \\&quot;sexy\\&quot;. Then finally, my last hair stylist gave me a cut and recommended \\&quot;cocky\\&quot;. He showed me how to use it - just a dime size applied @ the roots, scruff it up just a little, and style. And voila! My hair had volume that lasts throughout the day. I could put this stuff on in the morning and go out after work, scruff my hair up a little and it will look fantab. I&#x27;ve had friends compliment me on how great my hair looks now. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff. You can use it on wet or dry hair. I like to use it before blowdrying to give it more oomph.</li>
            <li> This product does create volume but it is very firm and somewhat sticky and you have to use in small amounts and definiteloy wash out the next day.</li>
            <li> I like this product, it does what it says.  I have a &amp;#34;spiked&amp;#34; hair style and need a good product to spike it.</li>
            <li> Always my go to product for my fine hair.  Have tried many others, but this works great.  Tube lasts about a year because you only use very little.</li>
            <li> Great product! Too bad it has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> Product is insanely overpriced.  It works sometimes, but really depends on hair.  Sometimes very sticky and clumpy.  Other products at one fourth the price and work so much better.</li>
            <li> I recently got this product, and have tried using a few different ways with very disappointing results.  This is basically just a mousse/gel...there is no \\&quot;thickening\\&quot; effect whatsoever.  My hair looks exactly the same, it just doesn&#x27;t move as much.  Next time I won&#x27;t get my hopes up.</li>
            <li> I just love this product.  My hairdresser says the company is discontinuing it and I am upset about it.  It is the best product ever for styling my hair.</li>
            <li> This hair product is great. Small amount&lt;br /&gt;Keeps hair in place. Have been using for&lt;br /&gt;a few years now. Last a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this was an old tube, but it had an &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; smell to it. I really didn&#x27;t see a difference in my hair. I stopped using it, because of the odd smell. I don&#x27;t know if they all smell like this.</li>
            <li> Waaaaaaay too expensive but this is an essential product for my hairstyle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and its the best I&#x27;ve found.  Cocky helps me to manage my hair.</li>
            <li> A bit more expensive than drug-store products but really really great.</li>
            <li> Perfect for styling hair, especially for those of us that don&#x27;t have too much of it. Provides great control and feels and looks as though actually thickens hair, the only problem is product has gotten ridiculously expensive. I used to buy two tubes for $32.00. Too bad TIGI not smart enough to keep on the market or doesn&#x27;t have another product that works similarly. or at last if they do they are marketing as such. Woule have given five stars if not for the ridiculous pricing.</li>
            <li> Wish it wasn&#x27;t discontinued!! Luv this stuff!!</li>
            <li> May just be me but I had to experiment with this product, almost like practicing. I found it worked best on damp towel dried hair. I use a dime sized amount on my super short hair (Making sure not to add too much to the roots or else it&#x27;ll look like you haven&#x27;t washed your hair in days). I then blow dry on hot at low speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product helped manipulate the hair to dry the way you want it to. With a bit of work you can really add volume to your hair. With a tube this big, it&#x27;ll last for quite a while!</li>
            <li> Love, love love this product and have tried so many different products and not one compares.  I don&#x27;t understand why they are not selling it in the beauty stores any longer.  I must purchase more in the near future just to stock up.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser introduced me to this product and I really love it. I have tried other similar ones but this is definitely the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product is old or what but it did have a peculiar smell like an outdated product. As far as the thickening I am still not sure on this as I haven&#x27;t used the product but a few times since I have a fairly new perm. My real test will happen after the perm is just about gone.</li>
            <li> Cocky hair paste is perfect for wanting a fuller head of hair.  My hair is straight with no body to it.  By using a nickel size portion of cocky on wet hair and combed through gives your hair body that you will love.  Be careful not to use too much because your hair will have a greasy look to it after it is dried.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at a salon and paid 3 times the amount. I have really thick hair and wanted something that would make my hair style &amp;#34;spike up&amp;#34; and this product worked great. I use it on my hair when it is dry and only use a very small amount (about the size of a pea because my hair if fairly short). If you use too much of this product it will make your hair look &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the stellar reviews of those with fine hair who claim it made their hair thick and textured. I am disappointed! It actually made my hair flat and overly silky. There is PVP and petrolatum in the ingredients which may have coated my hair too much. I used a tiny bit (the size of a pea) on wet hair then blew it dry. It may be a good conditioner but if you have fine hair that needs body, you should sample it somewhere before you waste the $.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve found I can use this product more effectively. I now use more of it (dime sized dollop for short hair) and massage it deeply at roots and then blow dry completely, and then some.&lt;br /&gt;I apparently wasn&#x27;t use enough before and leaving my hair a little damp. I can actually get some decent body with this product but it leaves my hair too silky, which defeats the purpose for me. I imagine it&#x27;s amazing for people with coarser, thicker hair than my baby fines.</li>
            <li> ebay is cheaper ..http://www.ebay.com/itm/New-Bed-Head-Cocky-Thickening-Paste-for-Fuller-Looking-Hair-by-TIGI-5-1-oz-/251926582351?pt&#x3D;LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash&#x3D;item3aa7fe944f</li>
            <li> Excellent product for your hair.  I would recommend this product.</li>
