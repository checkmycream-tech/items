            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to use, smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much for a great product!!!</li>
            <li>I leave it for a couple minutes and add  my favorite face cream, fabulous.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast, and packaging was good.</li>
            <li>It works really well on your face, soaks in nicely and is a much better price than at at the mall kiosk.</li>
            <li>The serum soaks right into your skin and leaves it feeling like silky smooth and amazing.  </li>
            <li>But - so far so good.</li>
            <li>Amazing product, I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>So rich and nourishing to my face.  </li>
            <li>I have 6 years using dead sea premier  and works very good for me....</li>
            <li>Airport, time to kill, friendly Sales Lady, the right place at the right time.</li>
            <li>And...the bottle shape is so pretty!</li>
            <li>When the sales person suggested this, I didn&#x27;t believe her but figured it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>I am 50 years old and most people I meet think I&#x27;m 40 and are stunned to learn my age!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>The complement I received, lifted my ego.&lt;br /&gt;You need to really use a gently cleanser to remove light build up.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it would be possible for my skin to look any better</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the eye serum, which is why I decided to give this facial serum a try.  </li>
            <li>my skin looks and feels amazing, soft, hydrated and smoother overall!</li>
            <li>I love this just as much, but only for night time.  </li>
            <li>have tried many, many product lines over the years in all price ranges and some that you can only purchase through a physician and NONE of them perform like Dead Sea Premiers products do.  </li>
            <li>I order them directly from the Israel and the shipping is pretty fast.  </li>
            <li>Apply the facial serum to your clean face and neck and don&#x27;t mistake it for being oily.  </li>
            <li>i use this product over 6 years and i love it, recomend to any one who wans to have wrinkles less visible</li>
            <li>When combined with a decent moisturizer this serum takes about 10 years off your appearance.  </li>
            <li>But my overall face has such a nice feel to it that the deep wrinkles don&#x27;t stand out as much.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>A friend even said my face looked softer after a couple of weeks of use... and I live in MN</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I use it with a sensitive skin drug store moisturizer over it by the way!</li>
            <li>It goes on skin oily and after 10-15 minutes absorbs completely.</li>
            <li>It makes my face really soft.</li>
            <li>At first, it appears to be a little heavier than I would like, but my face does absorb the whole thing in a matter of 10 minutes or so.  </li>
            <li>Bought my first bottle last year and haven&#x27;t turned back.</li>
            <li>My skin is dry and this really helps before putting on my makeup.</li>
            <li>Because of the serum&#x27;s consistency, you only need to use a little bit to have full coverage of your face and neck.  </li>
            <li>It is light and a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li>It may feel thick or &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; but this serum absorbs into your skin fairly quickly, leaving you with soft, supple skin.</li>
            <li>Much more dramatic effect than moisturizer alone.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> After trying it every cream seems to bother me as it never absorbs and leaves the skin dry.</li>
            <li> If u have dry skin</li>
            <li> recently started using the Dead Sea Premier Concentrated Facial Serum with Vitamin E &amp; C</li>
            <li> (and it&#x27;s winter out so skin gets dry!).</li>
            <li> What was irritating is that I received a green bottle, and not what was pictured - but does appear to be the same product - albeit an older one of the same brand.</li>
            <li> It may feel a little heavy, but it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and, yes, I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and needed that extra moisture and nutrient for my sometimes dull dryness.</li>
            <li> and it felt a little messy under my makeup.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use anything but Dead Sea Premier products on my skin!!&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I started using Dead Sea Premier products almost 2 years ago</li>
            <li> Dead Sea products is all I use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for at least 2 years</li>
            <li> I will buy it again - so much less expensive here than at the mall</li>
            <li> I received the products in approximately 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Besides it can not compare to a lot of expensive brands.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great product, makes my face and neck feel fresh and energized.  I will buy it again - so much less expensive here than at the mall (by 3 x ).</li>
            <li> I liked how the serum gave my skin moisture. However I gave this serum three stars for it is a pretty thick serum and it felt a little messy under my makeup.</li>
            <li> I love it awsome i used every night and mornings and all my family used too i face and neckn</li>
            <li> Love it! My skin is so dry, and this leaves my skin like silk.</li>
            <li> I use it daily for my face.  It made a big difference in the way my skin looks and feels like.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many brands that have done nothing from drug store to expensive. When the sales person suggested this, I didn&#x27;t believe her but figured it was worth a try. I love the way it makes my skin feel. Will it make a deep wrinkle disappear? No! Of course not! But my overall face has such a nice feel to it that the deep wrinkles don&#x27;t stand out as much. People complement me on how good I look. At my age, I can&#x27;t look like I did when I was younger but I can look great for my age! This seems to make people think so! I love it! I use it with a sensitive skin drug store moisturizer over it by the way!</li>
            <li> This product is a miracle product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never ever used a product that just sooths and heals the skin as well as keeping it well hydrated.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product ever since I was given a sample in Las Vegas four years ago.  It goes on easily with a beautiful fragrance and feels so good on my face.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for 2 years. It goes on skin oily and after 10-15 minutes absorbs completely. It leaves skin moist. Glowing. Amazing. After trying it every cream seems to bother me as it never absorbs and leaves the skin dry. Not with this serum. I will keep buying. Recommend it for every type of skin. As my skin is a combination and it goes perfectly on it. Besides it can not compare to a lot of expensive brands. It is so much better.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to use, smooth and silky.  However, used it twice a day and did not see any difference in skin texture then using regular face creams.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use anything but Dead Sea Premier products on my skin!!&lt;br /&gt;You know the products are working when your 16 year old son notices and tells you that your complexion is smooth, flawless and glowing and your friends insist you&#x27;ve had fillers.  I am 50 years old and most people I meet think I&#x27;m 40 and are stunned to learn my age!&lt;br /&gt;Since I started using Dead Sea Premier products almost 2 years ago I have seen a noticeable difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love their serums, cream facial products cause my skin to break out, since starting their product line I no longer have breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;I recently started using the Dead Sea Premier Concentrated Facial Serum with Vitamin E &amp; C and I love how silky my face feels. I didn&#x27;t think it would be possible for my skin to look any better but since I started using this serum my pores have minimized even more.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many, many product lines over the years in all price ranges and some that you can only purchase through a physician and NONE of them perform like Dead Sea Premiers products do.  I do not work for them or any companies associated with them or who sell their products and I don&#x27;t know anyone who does, this is my testimonial and it is not influenced by anyone.</li>
            <li> So rich and nourishing to my face.  I use it in the morning under my make up and love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It makes your wrinkles feel &amp; look like they are gone. Your face looks &amp; feel more youthful. Thanks so much for a great product!!!</li>
            <li> When combined with a decent moisturizer this serum takes about 10 years off your appearance.  Much more dramatic effect than moisturizer alone.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, I highly recommend it.  Dead Sea products is all I use.  I have purchased for my family members and everyone is in love with this products. I order them directly from the Israel and the shipping is pretty fast.  I received the products in approximately 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny. The complement I received, lifted my ego.&lt;br /&gt;You need to really use a gently cleanser to remove light build up.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast, and packaging was good. What was irritating is that I received a green bottle, and not what was pictured - but does appear to be the same product - albeit an older one of the same brand. If you Google this product - the bottling has changed yet again. But - so far so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for at least 2 years n I just love it.  If u have dry skin it is a great product and u should use the moisturizer that goes with it.  Works wonderful together........Love it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the eye serum, which is why I decided to give this facial serum a try.  I love this just as much, but only for night time.  At first, it appears to be a little heavier than I would like, but my face does absorb the whole thing in a matter of 10 minutes or so.  More than what I want to wait for morning time, but I love the way my face feels in the morning after I wake up and it isn&#x27;t all over my pillow!  It may feel a little heavy, but it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and, yes, I have sensitive skin.  Yes, will continue to use this!</li>
            <li> i use this product over 6 years and i love it, recomend to any one who wans to have wrinkles less visible</li>
            <li> Love this product. It makes my face really soft. It smells good. It is light and a little goes a very long way. It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product. It works really well on your face, soaks in nicely and is a much better price than at at the mall kiosk. A friend even said my face looked softer after a couple of weeks of use... and I live in MN (and it&#x27;s winter out so skin gets dry!).</li>
            <li> Just a great product...&lt;br /&gt;I had bought it before so I knew this...</li>
            <li> I love it.. make my skin feel silky. . I have 6 years using dead sea premier  and works very good for me.... I have a very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Serums are so important!  This serum has great coverage.  It may feel thick or &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; but this serum absorbs into your skin fairly quickly, leaving you with soft, supple skin.</li>
            <li> love, love, love this serum! my skin looks and feels amazing, soft, hydrated and smoother overall! would use this again and again!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  My of friends told me about it and said it takes 10 years off you.  I tried hers and was hooked.  I did not tell my bff I was using it and after about a week, she said, &amp;#34;you did something to your face, you look different.&amp;#34;  I told her about it she used mine and now she is hooked.</li>
            <li> Apply the facial serum to your clean face and neck and don&#x27;t mistake it for being oily.  The serum soaks right into your skin and leaves it feeling like silky smooth and amazing.  Because of the serum&#x27;s consistency, you only need to use a little bit to have full coverage of your face and neck.  This stuff is great and my skin looks fabulous.  And...the bottle shape is so pretty!</li>
            <li> A great product that works wonders. My skin is dry and this really helps before putting on my makeup.</li>
            <li> Airport, time to kill, friendly Sales Lady, the right place at the right time. Bought my first bottle last year and haven&#x27;t turned back. Every morning and night I put on dot on my face. This Serum goes a long way. I leave it for a couple minutes and add  my favorite face cream, fabulous. I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and needed that extra moisture and nutrient for my sometimes dull dryness. I love this product and would recommend it to anyone. Thank you.</li>
