            <li>For best results, this is what I did:&lt;br /&gt;First, I poured the setting lotion into a spray bottle for easier and more even distribution thought the hair.  </li>

            <li>This was OKAY.</li>
            <li>However, the consistency of this product is much more liquid than lotion.</li>
            <li>The results were incredible but if it werent for the perfume cream oil I would have sent it back.</li>
            <li>Very easy to get too much.</li>

            <li>I just dyed it bright green) and this is the only thing that has ever induced it to hold a curl for more than 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>I set curlers overnight with this stuff in the bottom 12&amp;#34; of my hair and braided the top part of it (total hair length is about 40&amp;#34;), and they held their curl all day.</li>

            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>This worked really well for my straight hair that refuses to ever hold a curl.</li>

            <li>iF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A SETTING LOTION THAT WONT MAKE YOUR HAIR CRUNCHY BUT SOFT AND FLEXIBLE, YOU NEED THIS!!</li>
            <li>I was doing pin curls, velcro rollers, and rag curls with wet sets and using an cheap curl setting lotion from Wal Mart.  </li>
            <li>We all did some dry and wet sets using Lottabody and had really amazing results.  </li>
            <li>I tried this product with my Conair hot rollers and, it does not set my hair properly.</li>

            <li>I sat under one of those soft, bonnet-style hairdryers, on a medium-high setting, for 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>, the lotion is a liquid, complete liquid.  </li>
            <li>After the curls set, they are very curly &amp; bouncing on the 1st day &amp; softer big wave on the 2nd day.</li>
            <li>in fact, it was barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li>was soft,  and managed curls well enough</li>
            <li>It did not dry all the way</li>

            <li> /&gt;There is a slight fragrance to the lotion, it&#x27;s meh, not great, not bad, but it doesn&#x27;t last at all.  </li>

            <li> Looks like what I wanted, have not used it as of this writing</li>
            <li> Great product that really holds.  It&#x27;s enabled me to try some new styles in the hottest and most humid summertime weather,  And the styles held up for hours!  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The product I received worked remarkably well on my hard-to-hold hair.  I did not find the scent to be overpowering...in fact, it was barely noticeable.  When I was done, so many people commented on my lovely hairdo.  Some even asked if I&#x27;d had it permed!  My hair was so shiny and full, with the set lasting for days.  For best results, this is what I did:&lt;br /&gt;First, I poured the setting lotion into a spray bottle for easier and more even distribution thought the hair.  Then, after washing it, I sprayed my damp hair all over with it;&lt;br /&gt;I then set my hair on those old-fashioned pink mesh rollers with the snap-on covers;&lt;br /&gt;Then I sat under one of those soft, bonnet-style hairdryers, on a medium-high setting, for 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;When I unrolled my hair and combed out, I was so pleased with the fullness and shine!  My pleasure only increased as I found that the set lasted and lasted for a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;This is my new can&#x27;t-live-without beauty product!  And it&#x27;s so reasonablly priced for a product that it so affective, too.  A real win-win!</li>
            <li> Using this product for years. It works well with my hair texture. It&#x27;s hard to find in stores so I am glad I found it on amazon.</li>
            <li> buy elsewhere it will be cheaper</li>
            <li> This setting lotion didn&#x27;t seem to work with my hair type.</li>
            <li> iF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A SETTING LOTION THAT WONT MAKE YOUR HAIR CRUNCHY BUT SOFT AND FLEXIBLE, YOU NEED THIS!! i even use it as a blowdrying lotion and its fabulous! the best on the market!!</li>
            <li> I have traight asian hair &amp; always have hard time to curl my hair that last. I am so pleased to find the only thing work for me to have good lasting curls is using curl formers (knock-off) with spraying my hair with this setting lotion: l mix it with water then mist it on my hair before I put on the curl formers. It doesn&#x27;t harden my hair, adds more shine to my hair plus no perfum smell at all. After the curls set, they are very curly &amp; bouncing on the 1st day &amp; softer big wave on the 2nd day. Love my curls when I have them!</li>
            <li> I tried this product with my Conair hot rollers and, it does not set my hair properly. It did not dry all the way and, my curls were hard with no body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I set my hair I use Herbal Essense holding moose and, it makes my hair bouncy with curls that hold for two days. So, I will stick with Herbal Essense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this product Lottabody at your own risk.</li>
            <li> Ih ave started doing vintage hairstyles, and one product kept popping up on the vintage hairstyle forums and tutorials.  Lottabody setting lotion.  I was doing pin curls, velcro rollers, and rag curls with wet sets and using an cheap curl setting lotion from Wal Mart.  Well I thought let&#x27;s look into this Lottabody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, the lotion is a liquid, complete liquid.  The instructions tell you to use it on dry hair.  I&#x27;ve done my hair on both.  I have exceptionally fine hair that waves, my girlfriend has thick curly hair and her daughters have thick straight hair.  We all did some dry and wet sets using Lottabody and had really amazing results.  The styles stayed put but were quite touchable - and shiny.  We did finger waves and big curls and pompadours and ringlets and rockabillys.  We made this setting lotion work for its name. The curls really held up.  I was very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a slight fragrance to the lotion, it&#x27;s meh, not great, not bad, but it doesn&#x27;t last at all.  I could still smell my conditioner when all was said and done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought two bottles at the time.  I expect that it will last me a while.  But, I wouldn&#x27;t want to run out either.</li>
            <li> I know this product from using it but have been unable to locate it recently so I checked on Amazon and found it.  I ordered it for a very reasonable cost and received it very quickly.  I have been using the product since then and I know I will buy again from this seller.  It arrived with no spills or breakage - was well-packed and sent quickly.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I used this with Vintage Skincare Organics &amp;#34;Monoi de Tahiti&amp;#34; cream oil to cover up the smell. The results were incredible but if it werent for the perfume cream oil I would have sent it back.</li>
            <li> Its a great product for your hair and it leaves your hair with body and shine!I will probably order more.</li>
            <li> This was OKAY. this could be due to me not understanding how to utilize it but it definitely is light weight and very sticky.</li>
            <li> thinner than expected but did last all day although it flaked as well, was soft,  and managed curls well enough</li>
            <li> ummm are we READING the instructions??????  if you don&#x27;t dilute this product as instructed you WILL get hard, crunchy hair ----and---- flakes!!</li>
            <li> It did do what it says, but when it dries it forms white flakes.  If my head rubs against anything, there&#x27;s a shower of white flakes from the dried product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using a regular gel instead, and got far better results.  Gel makes a beautiful soft hold if you break the cast, or stays shiny and firm if you don&#x27;t.  This product and gel held the shape of finger wave and pin curls equally well.</li>
            <li> I have long stick-straight virgin fine blonde hair (well, it was, I just dyed it bright green) and this is the only thing that has ever induced it to hold a curl for more than 20 minutes. I set curlers overnight with this stuff in the bottom 12&amp;#34; of my hair and braided the top part of it (total hair length is about 40&amp;#34;), and they held their curl all day. I refreshed the curls by setting them back into the curlers the next night, and had bouncy curls the next day as well. Perfect!</li>
            <li> This worked really well for my straight hair that refuses to ever hold a curl. Using this on my hair before setting pin curls worked great! My curls lasted all night. However, the consistency of this product is much more liquid than lotion. Very easy to get too much. I found that I only needed a few drops per curl to set it properly. Use too much and you get hard curls.</li>
            <li> I am loving, loving this product. I put some into a spray bottle for easier application. It gives my hair amazing hold and texture. i have very straight hair that doesn&#x27;t want to do anything. I need to style it dry and this is a great product for dry styling.</li>
