            <li>I was already in love with the treatment and was using it like a leave-in oil every two days.</li>
            <li>Love this product, too.</li>

            <li>this is great for dry frizzy hair and ok for fine hair</li>
            <li>Alternative Bamboo Smooth formula can be used as a nourishing treatment and as a color protecting style primer.</li>
            <li>It makes hair feels silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>It is light</li>
            <li>I think it is more for smoothing out curly frizzies, which, as my hair is completely smooth and straight, this isn&#x27;t my solution.</li>
            <li>but my daughter loved it and took my extra!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light but gives hair a decent amount of shine and smooths hair making</li>
            <li>smells good but does not control static in hair and makes hair limp if you have fine straight hair like I do</li>
            <li>If you have frizz this mist really calms it and makes it look smooth.  </li>
            <li>And it really does smooth and finish.</li>

            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I find this to be pretty much the same as the Kendi oil I buy in a pump bottle, which I love.</li>
            <li>It stops frizz as well as providing an intense shine.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t need a whole lot once I spray this on my damp hair</li>
            <li>and it really makes your hair shine.</li>
            <li>works real well help with the frizzes</li>
            <li>this is very light - keeps frizz way down and add some shine</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product..</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and live in a very dry climate, so in winter my hair is flying allover the place.</li>
            <li>This product works well on fine or color treated hair without weighing them down.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, curly hair that I blow dry straight, and it does not weigh it down or make it feel greasy at all!  </li>
            <li>I have noticed it has cut her styling time down significantly.</li>
            <li>This spray works very well on my very coarse hair!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Product is great, but he nozzle broke and unable to use after the first few uses...</li>
            <li>Not too heavy just right for Natural styles!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a heavy conditioning oil like Moroccan, it&#x27;s a light mist that you spray after your hair is dry to give it a little shine and tame frizz.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I usually use the Alterna  Kendi Dry oil in the spray pump but I decided to try this and turns out I love this even though its the micromist  it is the same product as the pump , the size is 5.0 oz a little bigger than the spray pump that is 4.2 oz</li>
            <li> We are still late to everything but thanks to this product...</li>
            <li> The little white piece inside the spray device fell out as soon as I sprayed it in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Not really.</li>
            <li> I use in addition to my other styling product.</li>
            <li> From my understanding alterna makes another oil spray that is a bit heavier targeted towards thick, coarse, or curly hair, My hair is thick and coarse but I wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t take body and movement from my relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> I never feel like my hair is greasy or weighted down.</li>
            <li> usually I air dry my hair ,</li>
            <li> which is odd.</li>
            <li> not as late as usual..</li>
            <li> I am addicted the the caviar repair texturing cream ...</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Very light mist...almost nonexistent! I like their oil MUCH better</li>
            <li> Use sparingly and it does work... I am addicted the the caviar repair texturing cream ...but this is good too.</li>
            <li> Alternative Bamboo Smooth formula can be used as a nourishing treatment and as a color protecting style primer. It stops frizz as well as providing an intense shine. It makes hair feels silky and smooth. This product works well on fine or color treated hair without weighing them down.</li>
            <li> If you have frizz this mist really calms it and makes it look smooth.  I rely on it when I have a frizz problem and&lt;br /&gt;will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great price and it is a great product</li>
            <li> This is the best hair oil I have ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried everything!  It&#x27;s not a heavy conditioning oil like Moroccan, it&#x27;s a light mist that you spray after your hair is dry to give it a little shine and tame frizz.

            <li> Product is great, but he nozzle broke and unable to use after the first few uses... Dissapointed</li>
            <li> I usually use the Alterna  Kendi Dry oil in the spray pump but I decided to try this and turns out I love this even though its the micromist  it is the same product as the pump , the size is 5.0 oz a little bigger than the spray pump that is 4.2 oz I feel I can apply this more evenly  on my hair .I love all Alterna hair products that I have used this is great for dry frizzy hair and ok for fine hair you don&#x27;t need a whole lot once I spray this on my damp hair I run the brush through my hair and usually I air dry my hair ,this leaves my hair free of frizz and soft and manageable the smell is awesome and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily or weighed down looking.</li>
            <li> Wife says it&#x27;s a necessary when styling hair....I have noticed it has cut her styling time down significantly. We are still late to everything but thanks to this product...not as late as usual..</li>
            <li> I find this to be pretty much the same as the Kendi oil I buy in a pump bottle, which I love. The Micromist is considerably more expensive, so I will not buy it again and stick with the pump bottle version.</li>
            <li> I have used the pump of this product for years. I like the mist even better.  It is lightweight. I never feel like my hair is greasy or weighted down. It seems shinier and the curls are more defined.  I use in addition to my other styling product.</li>
            <li> This spray works very well on my very coarse hair!!!!!!!!! :) :)</li>
            <li> Awesome seller!! Fast shipping! Great product! Definitely use again! I recommend!! The product is the best and works well with adult hair for women.</li>
            <li> Love this product it isn&#x27;t oily and it really makes your hair shine. It smells really good I bought two but my daughter loved it and took my extra! I will be ordering this regularly!!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this! And it really does smooth and finish.</li>
            <li> not as effective as id hoped. feels like after time dries the hair out... which is odd.</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes hair super shiny and sleek looking!</li>
            <li> The little white piece inside the spray device fell out as soon as I sprayed it in my hair.  This is definitely a defective can.</li>
            <li> smells good but does not control static in hair and makes hair limp if you have fine straight hair like I do</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and live in a very dry climate, so in winter my hair is flying allover the place. I was looking for a anti-static remedy, and read that this would do the trick. Not really. I think it is more for smoothing out curly frizzies, which, as my hair is completely smooth and straight, this isn&#x27;t my solution. It rally smells great, though, and it helps somewhat.</li>
            <li> I really love this spray. I use it at night after I&#x27;ve gotten out of the shower and brushed my hair.  It is light so it does&#x27;t make my hair seem oily. It also smells AMAZING! Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I was already in love with the treatment and was using it like a leave-in oil every two days. So when I found out they made a micromist I was sold. It&#x27;s very light but gives hair a decent amount of shine and smooths hair making it&lt;br /&gt;soft. From my understanding alterna makes another oil spray that is a bit heavier targeted towards thick, coarse, or curly hair, My hair is thick and coarse but I wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t take body and movement from my relaxed hair. So the micromist is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Thanks! Love this product, too. Smells great and keeps my fly aways tame!</li>
            <li> Not too heavy just right for Natural styles! Would highly recommend this product.. Never used before! But LOVE IT! Get it!</li>
            <li> this is very light - keeps frizz way down and add some shine</li>
            <li> works real well help with the frizzes</li>
