    <ol>
            <li>Works perfectly!</li>
            <li>It also helps reduce inflammation from acne, which is great!</li>

            <li>This however works great.</li>

            <li>to use correctly&lt;br /&gt;Not happy at all&lt;br /&gt;Still in my drawer unused</li>
            <li>I am also happy with the coverage under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>so I feel qualified to say that it&#x27;s great for that &amp;#</li>
            <li>Once they are kinda gone it works perfect and makes my skin look nice.</li>
            <li>I have always used MAC concealer and decided to try this... and to my amazement, it is a great product.</li>
            <li>Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It works great.  </li>
            <li>but this works great covering the purple.</li>
            <li>This really is great stuff.  </li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>When Burt&#x27;s Bees discontinued their great under eye concealer</li>
            <li>Great texture.</li>
            <li>Coverage is great.</li>
            <li>For those of you whom are darker, this concealer works equally great.</li>
            <li>I am quite happy with all of my purchases from Watts and would recommend trying them.  </li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>It brightens up my under eye very nicely, and I also use it as a lid primer</li>
            <li>This is the best concealer I have ever used, and I have tried many.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more of this wonderful product.</li>
            <li>Watts, please keep making your magical concealer, it is awesome.</li>
            <li>Creamy, bright.</li>
            <li>It provides good coverage.  </li>
            <li>It matches my fair skin tone.</li>
            <li>Makes me feel good about the product.</li>
            <li>A good product.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of good coverage.</li>
            <li>For the ladies that know how to contour and highlight your face, this is a good highlighter bc</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use this unless you have extremely fair skin.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Perfect consistency, great coverage, doesn&#x27;t settle into lines, just the right amount of creaminess, etc...  </li>
            <li>I find it best to apply with a clean lipstick brush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with all of your products</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took me a while to try this concealer, but I am SO Glad I did!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>so glad i did!</li>
            <li>Many things that say that on their packing have proved to be lying about it to me!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>That is the most remarkable thing about this product.  </li>
            <li>It has great coverage of under eye circles and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This duo works amazingly and if I set the concealer afterwards with a setting powder that has some shimmer to it</li>
            <li>then I can honestly say this is absolutely the best under eye concealer combo I have found!!</li>
            <li>so I decided I would like one in my own bathroom</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not so effective.</li>
            <li>It is nice, but not a miracle worker.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best under-eye concealer I have ever used.</li>
            <li>My mineral make up flows nicely over it.</li>
            <li>Kind of a yellowish tint.</li>
            <li>Make sure that your under eye is well nourished and then use a good stipple (?) brush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also purchased mineral powder and is quite nice as well.</li>
            <li>Watts wins!!!</li>
            <li>If you have what&#x27;s considered fair skin by most products (BE fairly light/fair, Almay light, etc.), this concealer will most-likely work well for you.</li>
            <li>It has a really nice consistency which I love</li>
            <li>even on a fair skin it is too light.</li>
            <li>many of the reviews said it was totally amazing.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re always buying in the bottom two categories for makeup colors (you know, fair, light, etc...)</li>
            <li>Best natural ingredient concealer I&#x27;ve come across.  </li>
            <li>Feels wonderful, applies smoothly, and is great for muting facial redness and under-eye circles.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t understand what was happening until I did my own research and found many people complaining about irritated lips and skin after using products containing beeswax.  </li>
            <li>My skin type is fair with a cool undertone.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It is quite yellow but covers blemishes wonderfully and hides my under eye circles.</li>
            <li>I use this under my normal cover up (Liquid then powder) and it works beautifully.</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this concealer</li>
            <li>However, I love using this one to lighten up freckles, eliminate redness, and even out skin tone.</li>
            <li>I have tried it and it covers ok.</li>
            <li>I was expecting this to be more like a tinted moisturizer in consistency when it said cream...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay..</li>
            <li>so it might be that I need to use more than two layers of concealer.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)  </li>
            <li>I would most defiantly buy again.</li>
            <li>Hope this helped :)</li>
            <li>and I feel that they get better with time with this concealer.</li>
            <li>I love the creamy texture of this concealer.  </li>
            <li>and I do not say that LIGHTLY!</li>
            <li>love love love love:)</li>
            <li>But, how about some more colors?</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>It turns out that I am one of many individuals allergic to beeswax.  </li>
            <li>It would be better if it were creamier and went on easily as I use it under my eye area mostly</li>
            <li>but mychelle is more moisturizing and easy to spread.</li>
            <li>very good lasting coverage.  </li>
            <li>For me, the pros greatly outweigh the cons, so I would highly recommend this concealer to people with light to medium skin tones.&lt;br /&gt;You can see pictures and my Pros / Cons at [...]</li>
            <li>It has natural ingredients and great for under eye or blemishes.</li>
            <li>Wow, for an organic concealer this is great option and creamy.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t even get enough on my finger to do any good at first, and when I did, the concealer wasn&#x27;t even great.</li>
            <li>Easy to blend in.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly easy to get the hang of blending it in.</li>
            <li>I am trying to use the most natural products I can find and this one is good.</li>
            <li>The only complain is that it does&#x27;nt moistrurize so make sure you sure a good moisturizer</li>
            <li>that was a tad too dark for me and the result is beautiful!!  </li>
            <li>The pictures I saw looked exactly like the kind of redness and swelling that&#x27;s on my eyelids and beneath my eyes where the eye cream was used.  </li>
            <li>It works fine when I pre mix it with concelear for texture, but I don&#x27;t have paitence to do that every day.</li>
            <li>It does not appear to settle into my fine lines if I do this.  </li>
            <li>Not the super wonder of the world coverup as stated in some reviews!</li>
            <li>Under eye okay, didn&#x27;t like for eyelids creased too quickly and blemishes so-so.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I finally found a great product and the price is right!</li>
            <li>they need to add something to make this product smooth to apply.  </li>
            <li>The formula is creamy &amp; smooth without being oily.  </li>
            <li>Smooth texture.  </li>
            <li>great for concealing red marks</li>
            <li>Packaging is cheap.</li>
            <li>This concealer is great, I use it under the eyes and on blemishes and red spots.</li>
            <li>I like it because I&#x27;m  light skinned</li>
            <li>and i need light coverage for scars.</li>
            <li>but the brightness of it actually looks great underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li>It looks somewhat unnaturally light and draws attention to my under-eye rather than covering it.</li>
            <li>I lightly dust it with a mineral foundation after application which helps to blend the color-</li>
            <li>I noticed another reviewer said it was too light for their skin.  </li>
            <li>I suspect it would be too light for any darker skin tones.  </li>
            <li>I dispaired of ever finding anything I liked as well, however I really like this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>D0 use a light hand when applying.  </li>
            <li>color for light skin tones:&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>This product arrived as promised in secure packaging.  </li>
            <li>This concealer covers nicely, goes on easily and lasts a decent amount of time  .  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I am happy all around with a concealer, and that&#x27;s saying a lot since I have used about 20 different brands including Tarte &amp; Elysee which are my favorite brands.  </li>
            <li>concealer is the first cosmetic I put on my face so that it blends nicely with the face cream and eye cream that have just been absorbed into my skin.  </li>
            <li>This does not give super strong coverage-</li>
            <li>Stays for many hours, blends in nicely and does not dry your skin!  </li>
            <li>I have used many concealers before but I like this one a lot, because it&#x27;s very gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>An added benefit is that Watts&#x27; concealer is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin :)</li>
            <li>However, it might not be right for all skin shades and types (I have fair, normal skin).</li>
            <li>I love all of the very natural ingredients and I love that it&lt;br /&gt;is</li>
            <li>There was a significant difference.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>but if I put too much on, it settles into the fine lines and makes them more noticeable.</li>
            <li>Luckily, the cream is so smooth.  </li>
            <li>This Watts brand is not drying, blends right in with the skin, and does not emphasize fine lines.  </li>
            <li>Blends in naturally and amazingly.</li>
            <li>Works great at covering up red spots, and I love that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make me look like I have anything on but makes it look like I got a full nights sleep.  </li>
            <li>It makes me look much perkier. :-)</li>
            <li>The price is not bad, either.</li>
            <li>the color is super opaque bright yellow.</li>
            <li>When I found this product for half the price with its great reviews, I decided to try it since the description made it sound</li>
            <li>No pimples so far, all natural and a great price.</li>
            <li>It is a great base for my mineral foundation and BEST of all...</li>
            <li>It was shipped quickly, and in one piece.  </li>
            <li>it blends in very easily and looks natural, not too make-upey..</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;works great to hide dark circles.  </li>
            <li>Buy more then one, I believe they sell-out pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I would LOVE to see this exact same product in a fair tone (either a light yellow for under makeup or just a skin tone color).  </li>
            <li>I was worried it would be too yellow and not blend well with my skin tone (which is very fair / red tone in some areas)</li>
            <li>This was a huge dissapointment, I really wanted it to work.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34;, meaning it doesn&#x27;t smooth very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
            <li>For the price, worth a try.</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous concealers on this area and never found one I liked until I tried Watts.</li>
            <li>For reference, I have a medium golden skin tone..</li>
            <li>worth the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m happy to get my little jar of pretty skin in the mail.</li>
            <li>do not use it under my eyes because I&#x27;m too fair and the yellow color looked funny on me.&lt;br /&gt;However, as much as I do like this,  </li>
            <li>right.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, my sensitive skin has not had one single pimple the whole time I have been using this in conjunction with the Watts Beauty Minerals in Fair.</li>
            <li>the palest person I know and the color blends right in</li>
            <li>I must have a yellow toned skin because I have found it is the best tint for all of my  \\&quot;cover ups\\&quot; not just dark circles...</li>
            <li>This product was supposed to be very soft and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This is more than likely due to me also having fair skin</li>
            <li>I am acne prone and tried using it on a few acne scars which covered wonderfully by the way, but it inflamed my skin and gave my big Cysts where I applied it.</li>
            <li>I love that it is natural and the color matches my skin very well.  </li>
            <li>This concealer is probably great for mild to moderate circles but mine are deep and no concealer really covers them.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable and of course very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I like this concealer very much</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t settle into fine lines and is natural.</li>
            <li>Best of all, a little goes a long way...</li>
            <li>Lasts a really long time and is perfect for covering my dark circles!</li>
            <li>I use moisturizer first and then dab this on with a concealer brush and follow with Watts mineral powder.</li>
            <li>but I must say that since this product is SO yellow, for best results I ended up blending it in to a small amount of my Laura Mercier concealer.</li>
            <li>I guess I have more obvious circles.  </li>
            <li>Also, most brands are drying &amp; leave obvious signs of a concealer on the face.  </li>
            <li>Only deducted one star because it could be slightly more pigmented.</li>
            <li>Thank you for replacing the first one I purchased.</li>
            <li>It does not last all day as I find I have to add more as the day goes on</li>
            <li>Very glad this item is natural, I have been in the market for such a product.  </li>
            <li>It only took a small swipe/touch for my eyes to be concealed.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome, awesome product!</li>
            <li>This concealer is far too light for me-</li>
            <li>will buy it again, especially because I love the ingredients.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what it does for me.</li>
            <li>A&lt;br /&gt;FOUNDATION which better matches your skin tone (i.e. one that is not yellow)!  </li>
            <li>I will absolutely repurchase!  </li>
            <li>I lurve this product, thanks!</li>
            <li>this is the first product that I have seen that actually covers up the circles and not make them more pronounced.</li>
            <li>The first was Physicians formula</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use much of it!  </li>
            <li>I tried many different products with out real satisfaction.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very yellow tinted though so  definitely get a good  brush to blend .  </li>
            <li>I usually use it under powder makeup, but it&#x27;s good even without, just remember to blend.</li>
            <li>It is smooth, creamy, not too opaque and does not slide around or sink into fine lines like most concealers, making lines look much worse than they really are.  </li>
            <li>Often I have to do my own research to track down a product&#x27;s ingredients and it gets so time consuming.  </li>
            <li>if you have dry skin it would make your undereye wrinkles more pronounced.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, I have to put this on first to help diminish my purple veins under my eyes and then use a second concealer for my puffiness</li>
            <li>I only didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I need to put quite a bit on to have effect and it rubs off easily.</li>
            <li>I only wish it didn&#x27;t rub off so easily.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin, I&#x27;m 50 years old and have always had to deal with dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I will certainly buy it again.  </li>
            <li>Light, silky smooth makeup, easy to apply, thin or in layers.</li>
            <li>But when I tried it the color was just right for my skin tone which is fair with a slight yellow undertone.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who wants to cover their under eye circles or blemishes.</li>
            <li>This cream really does the job on covering under the eyes, blemishes.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s very generously priced for the size of product and the amount you need to use.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very yellow-tinted.</li>
            <li>This is a great concealer for blemishes, it covers them up well without harmful ingredients and without making the blemish worse.</li>
            <li>thanks god</li>
            <li>I really like the way it makes me look.</li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t wear makeup, I&#x27;m not accustomed to needing to be careful about touching my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>It is very creamy.</li>
            <li>I really think that Amazon should require a listing of all ingredients from sellers for makeup and skin products.  </li>
            <li>For the amount that cosmetic companies charge for their products, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too much to ask to have them disclose what they&#x27;re asking the consumer to pay for.  </li>
            <li>Warning it is very yellow-toned, so know that going in.</li>
            <li>If I use too much primer, Watts \\&quot;slides\\&quot; off.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would perform really well since I paid so much.  </li>
            <li>I just recieved my concealer a few days ago and so far so good.</li>
            <li>the only redeeming quality is that it is natural.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s why she wears makeup at such a young age:)</li>
            <li>But when I need to even out the tone a little, this is my new favorite!</li>
            <li>I have also come to find that while my skin hates almond oil, the skin under my eyes love it and due to the almond oil in this product</li>
            <li>I love it, however, for hiding bruises and discolorations on other areas of my face, arms and legs.</li>
            <li>Much more product than other organics give you</li>
            <li>I also really like their other products that I&#x27;ve tried, and they are all very affordable and high quality. :-)</li>
            <li>It does work better as a base with foundation, but still works fine on its own.</li>
            <li>I found it to be more dry than creamy, even when I use a primer underneath directly before applying.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and lasts all day long.</li>
            <li>Covers up the dark circles better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li>Love the make up, hides the dark areas and blemish.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive to urea (used as a preservative in cosmetics) and BHT (Butylated Hydroxytoulene which is apparently related to the toluene found in nail polish that many people are allergic to) and so, being fed up with having to check every ingredient list of every makeup and skin care product I wanted to buy, I decided to go all natural or organic.</li>
            <li>Along with a little blush and mineral powder, my whole face looks more vibrant.</li>
            <li>but over all it does a decent job.</li>
            <li>One container has lasted more than 6 months- will probably take a year of daily use to go through the entire thing.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to conceal mild or moderate circles, this could be your holy grail concealer.</li>
            <li>If I were to press my finger into it with a decent amount of pressure, it would not part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I received this product I initially thought the bright yellow color was a bit strange.  </li>
            <li>Even better, I use it under my eyes on the dark circles and they disappear!</li>
            <li>so  even though it comes in a little jar ,it&#x27;s still going, i use it every day, and when I run out I will buy more , but it has helped with my skin.</li>
            <li>Other than that it is good quality ingredients and the tone is a pale yellow which is good for dark spots.</li>
            <li>It blends well with cover up and powder and is not thick.</li>
            <li>Watts mineral foundation is great for the summer because the powder doesn&#x27;t add to the oil/sweat that unfortunately come with summer weather.  </li>
            <li>Dabbing it on under my eyes though it worked very well, I did dab two twice just to get complete coverage.</li>
            <li>can make natural make up yourself, but you don&#x27;t really end up saving any money.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The yellow tone helps to cover dark circles under eyes and covers redness quite nicely as well.  </li>
            <li>I normally use a product by benefit called lemon-aid.</li>
            <li>Normal skin (not oily, not dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>long as I put some foundation over the top, the yellow disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is good at disguising dark circles, but it settles in the fine lines and looks worse than the products I was using before.  </li>
            <li>This is my new must-have.</li>
            <li>I was worried about the yellow, but it works very well under foundation and really helps cover acne and scars.</li>
            <li>It is very yellow, but light weight and would need multiple coats to see the color.</li>
            <li>Much better than I expected, would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive, but this concealer has not caused me any breakouts.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and acne prone.</li>
            <li>To begin, my skin is VERY sensitive</li>
            <li>It covers, takes very little and does not cause more break outs.</li>
            <li>I was not sure with the many reviews in buying this product...</li>
            <li>only problem with it is that it melted in my hot car.</li>
            <li>otherwise it looks pretty yellow.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Normally, I wouldn&#x27;t use concealers for the nose and cheeks because most go on a bit thick for my taste, making it look unnatural and even cakey.</li>
            <li>After using this for a few weeks my boyfriend said something along the lines of &amp;#34;I can tell you&#x27;ve been sleeping better, the circles under your eyes are barely noticeable anymore!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am in my early fifties and this is the first concealer and last concealer I will ever use.</li>
            <li>which that it hid dark circles more than it actually does.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping I don&#x27;t create more wrinkles by having to work so hard at and smoothing it out.</li>
            <li>didnt like this formula it was greasy and never dried.</li>
            <li>Also Reduces Redness &amp; Acne - Unscented and All Natural.</li>
            <li>I like he idea that it&#x27;s all natural and contains primrose oil, shea butter, jojoba, vitamin E, and rosemary.  </li>
            <li>It makes it completely disappear and does not come off until I use soap and water.</li>
            <li>My 11 year old daughter</li>
            <li>it look so cheap &amp; uneven ,, I&#x27;m a makeup artist</li>
            <li>/&gt;this combination, you can help build a surprisingly natural layered effect which</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ingredients aren&#x27;t cheap, and I find it messy and wasteful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it lasts forever because there is no waste.  </li>
            <li>and I had to tug on the delicate skin there more than I would like.  </li>
            <li>I apply it under my eyes, on my eyelids and on my smile lines next to my nose (where I tend to get red).</li>
            <li>and there is a HUGE difference between the purple under my eyes and my pale skin.</li>
            <li>this is no different or better then any other standard, and cheaper, drug store brand concealer and for that reason I&#x27;m taking away one star.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, make sure to blend it thoroughly.</li>
            <li>it ot be larger but its a small thing of concealer that is like most concealers that ive used, nothing unordinary to me</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s decent sized and will last forever.</li>
            <li>for under eyes, red spots, or lightening cheek bones.&lt;br /&gt;For those who seemed to have an issue with the consistency, just like shea butter, it softens with warmth, so: just rub your fingertip in little circles on the surface, and it will lightly cream.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>You do not need to use much so this container will go a very long way.  </li>
            <li>I used this under my eyes, it was so dry that it tugged the skin no matter how much concealer I used.</li>
            <li>The product isn&#x27;t a liquid or really a cream, it&#x27;s almost a solid like white chocolate that melts on your finger into.</li>
            <li>A little pot goes a long way and it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li>For some reason, I was expecting this to be a mineral powder concealer like Bare Minerals.  </li>
            <li>This concealer is just far too yellow to work.</li>
            <li>But I definitely recommend it thus far...</li>
            <li>The coverage is buildable and lasts all day, but because the color is similar to natural butter, I would not recommend it for anyone with a tan or darker complexion.  </li>
            <li>This product corrects redness with a yellow color when once applied blends with your natural skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I barely wear make up.</li>
            <li>This is the second &#x27;all natural&#x27; make up concealer I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li>To the red inflamed skin on my cheeks, it&#x27;s all natural an moisturizing</li>
            <li>I spent too much money on this product.  </li>
            <li>concealer is smooth and thick.  </li>
            <li>This concealer glides on as a thin layer and can be layered on for more coverage.</li>
            <li>Also, it was way too light for my skin tone, and even under my thick Clinique foundation it still created horrible.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>It comes in a jar that has a false bottom to make it look like you are getting more in the jar.</li>
            <li>I use a little mineral powder over the concealer to get the right tone.  </li>
            <li>If I were a little less ghostly I&#x27;d love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>but it has a very yellow tone to it which makes it hard to blend easily into skin.  </li>
            <li>The color is fantastic; a very pale color with a tinge of yellow tone to it.  </li>
            <li>It also covers poorly, and actually draws more attention to the area I&#x27;m trying to cover.  </li>
            <li>It works very well with the dark circles and it even helps with the bags.  </li>
            <li>I like the golden yellow color, and I use it for under eye area, contouring down the sides of my nose, as a coverup for minor blemishes, and to open up the inside corners of my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive and dry skin</li>
            <li>It really covers my dark circles and doesn&#x27;t look yellow at all.</li>
            <li>I have a small area of discoloration on my shin that shows through my stockings and makes me very self conscious.</li>
            <li>Dark purple under-eye circles, thanks to my Italian side.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll do and takes less time to apply than some (due to the yellow hue), but it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li>It does tend to cake up in the small wrinkles around my eyes and underneath the bags I have, but I&#x27;m sure this is only noticeable to me when I&#x27;m scrutinizing with my face a few inches away from a mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You definitely get what you pay for with this little jar, it conceals blemishes, under eye circles without being cakey or &#x27;paint like&#x27; its smooths out really well.</li>

            <li> Very nice.</li>
            <li> It brightens up my under eye very nicely, and I also use it as a lid primer</li>
            <li> This is the best concealer I have ever used, and I have tried many.  </li>
            <li> I will be ordering more of this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Watts, please keep making your magical concealer, it is awesome.</li>
            <li> Creamy, bright.</li>
            <li> It provides good coverage.  </li>
            <li> It matches my fair skin tone.</li>
            <li> Makes me feel good about the product.</li>
            <li> A good product.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of good coverage.</li>
            <li> For the ladies that know how to contour and highlight your face, this is a good highlighter bc</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use this unless you have extremely fair skin.  </li>
            <li> This is a good product.  </li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Perfect consistency, great coverage, doesn&#x27;t settle into lines, just the right amount of creaminess, etc...  </li>
            <li> I find it best to apply with a clean lipstick brush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with all of your products</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took me a while to try this concealer, but I am SO Glad I did!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> so glad i did!</li>
            <li> Many things that say that on their packing have proved to be lying about it to me!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> That is the most remarkable thing about this product.  </li>
            <li> It has great coverage of under eye circles and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This duo works amazingly and if I set the concealer afterwards with a setting powder that has some shimmer to it</li>
            <li> then I can honestly say this is absolutely the best under eye concealer combo I have found!!</li>
            <li> so I decided I would like one in my own bathroom</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not so effective.</li>
            <li> It is nice, but not a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best under-eye concealer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> My mineral make up flows nicely over it.</li>
            <li> Kind of a yellowish tint.</li>
            <li> Make sure that your under eye is well nourished and then use a good stipple (?) brush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also purchased mineral powder and is quite nice as well.</li>
            <li> Watts wins!!!</li>
            <li> If you have what&#x27;s considered fair skin by most products (BE fairly light/fair, Almay light, etc.), this concealer will most-likely work well for you.</li>
            <li> It has a really nice consistency which I love</li>
            <li> even on a fair skin it is too light.</li>
            <li> many of the reviews said it was totally amazing.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re always buying in the bottom two categories for makeup colors (you know, fair, light, etc...)</li>
            <li> Best natural ingredient concealer I&#x27;ve come across.  </li>
            <li> Feels wonderful, applies smoothly, and is great for muting facial redness and under-eye circles.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t understand what was happening until I did my own research and found many people complaining about irritated lips and skin after using products containing beeswax.  </li>
            <li> My skin type is fair with a cool undertone.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> It is quite yellow but covers blemishes wonderfully and hides my under eye circles.</li>
            <li> I use this under my normal cover up (Liquid then powder) and it works beautifully.</li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this concealer</li>
            <li> However, I love using this one to lighten up freckles, eliminate redness, and even out skin tone.</li>
            <li> I have tried it and it covers ok.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this to be more like a tinted moisturizer in consistency when it said cream...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay..</li>
            <li> so it might be that I need to use more than two layers of concealer.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)  </li>
            <li> I would most defiantly buy again.</li>
            <li> Hope this helped :)</li>
            <li> and I feel that they get better with time with this concealer.</li>
            <li> I love the creamy texture of this concealer.  </li>
            <li> and I do not say that LIGHTLY!</li>
            <li> love love love love:)</li>
            <li> But, how about some more colors?</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> It turns out that I am one of many individuals allergic to beeswax.  </li>
            <li> It would be better if it were creamier and went on easily as I use it under my eye area mostly</li>
            <li> but mychelle is more moisturizing and easy to spread.</li>
            <li> very good lasting coverage.  </li>
            <li> For me, the pros greatly outweigh the cons, so I would highly recommend this concealer to people with light to medium skin tones.&lt;br /&gt;You can see pictures and my Pros / Cons at [...]</li>
            <li> It has natural ingredients and great for under eye or blemishes.</li>
            <li> Wow, for an organic concealer this is great option and creamy.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even get enough on my finger to do any good at first, and when I did, the concealer wasn&#x27;t even great.</li>
            <li> Easy to blend in.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly easy to get the hang of blending it in.</li>
            <li> I am trying to use the most natural products I can find and this one is good.</li>
            <li> The only complain is that it does&#x27;nt moistrurize so make sure you sure a good moisturizer</li>
            <li> that was a tad too dark for me and the result is beautiful!!  </li>
            <li> The pictures I saw looked exactly like the kind of redness and swelling that&#x27;s on my eyelids and beneath my eyes where the eye cream was used.  </li>
            <li> It works fine when I pre mix it with concelear for texture, but I don&#x27;t have paitence to do that every day.</li>
            <li> It does not appear to settle into my fine lines if I do this.  </li>
            <li> Not the super wonder of the world coverup as stated in some reviews!</li>
            <li> Under eye okay, didn&#x27;t like for eyelids creased too quickly and blemishes so-so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I finally found a great product and the price is right!</li>
            <li> they need to add something to make this product smooth to apply.  </li>
            <li> The formula is creamy &amp; smooth without being oily.  </li>
            <li> Smooth texture.  </li>
            <li> great for concealing red marks</li>
            <li> Packaging is cheap.</li>
            <li> This concealer is great, I use it under the eyes and on blemishes and red spots.</li>
            <li> I like it because I&#x27;m  light skinned</li>
            <li> and i need light coverage for scars.</li>
            <li> but the brightness of it actually looks great underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li> It looks somewhat unnaturally light and draws attention to my under-eye rather than covering it.</li>
            <li> I lightly dust it with a mineral foundation after application which helps to blend the color-</li>
            <li> I noticed another reviewer said it was too light for their skin.  </li>
            <li> I suspect it would be too light for any darker skin tones.  </li>
            <li> I dispaired of ever finding anything I liked as well, however I really like this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> D0 use a light hand when applying.  </li>
            <li> color for light skin tones:&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> This product arrived as promised in secure packaging.  </li>
            <li> This concealer covers nicely, goes on easily and lasts a decent amount of time  .  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I am happy all around with a concealer, and that&#x27;s saying a lot since I have used about 20 different brands including Tarte &amp; Elysee which are my favorite brands.  </li>
            <li> concealer is the first cosmetic I put on my face so that it blends nicely with the face cream and eye cream that have just been absorbed into my skin.  </li>
            <li> This does not give super strong coverage-</li>
            <li> Stays for many hours, blends in nicely and does not dry your skin!  </li>
            <li> I have used many concealers before but I like this one a lot, because it&#x27;s very gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> An added benefit is that Watts&#x27; concealer is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin :)</li>
            <li> However, it might not be right for all skin shades and types (I have fair, normal skin).</li>
            <li> I love all of the very natural ingredients and I love that it&lt;br /&gt;is</li>
            <li> There was a significant difference.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> but if I put too much on, it settles into the fine lines and makes them more noticeable.</li>
            <li> Luckily, the cream is so smooth.  </li>
            <li> This Watts brand is not drying, blends right in with the skin, and does not emphasize fine lines.  </li>
            <li> Blends in naturally and amazingly.</li>
            <li> Works great at covering up red spots, and I love that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make me look like I have anything on but makes it look like I got a full nights sleep.  </li>
            <li> It makes me look much perkier. :-)</li>
            <li> The price is not bad, either.</li>
            <li> the color is super opaque bright yellow.</li>
            <li> When I found this product for half the price with its great reviews, I decided to try it since the description made it sound</li>
            <li> No pimples so far, all natural and a great price.</li>
            <li> It is a great base for my mineral foundation and BEST of all...</li>
            <li> It was shipped quickly, and in one piece.  </li>
            <li> it blends in very easily and looks natural, not too make-upey..</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;works great to hide dark circles.  </li>
            <li> Buy more then one, I believe they sell-out pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I would LOVE to see this exact same product in a fair tone (either a light yellow for under makeup or just a skin tone color).  </li>
            <li> I was worried it would be too yellow and not blend well with my skin tone (which is very fair / red tone in some areas)</li>
            <li> This was a huge dissapointment, I really wanted it to work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34;, meaning it doesn&#x27;t smooth very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
            <li> For the price, worth a try.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous concealers on this area and never found one I liked until I tried Watts.</li>
            <li> For reference, I have a medium golden skin tone..</li>
            <li> worth the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to get my little jar of pretty skin in the mail.</li>
            <li> do not use it under my eyes because I&#x27;m too fair and the yellow color looked funny on me.&lt;br /&gt;However, as much as I do like this,  </li>
            <li> right.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, my sensitive skin has not had one single pimple the whole time I have been using this in conjunction with the Watts Beauty Minerals in Fair.</li>
            <li> the palest person I know and the color blends right in</li>
            <li> I must have a yellow toned skin because I have found it is the best tint for all of my  \\&quot;cover ups\\&quot; not just dark circles...</li>
            <li> This product was supposed to be very soft and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This is more than likely due to me also having fair skin</li>
            <li> I am acne prone and tried using it on a few acne scars which covered wonderfully by the way, but it inflamed my skin and gave my big Cysts where I applied it.</li>
            <li> I love that it is natural and the color matches my skin very well.  </li>
            <li> This concealer is probably great for mild to moderate circles but mine are deep and no concealer really covers them.</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable and of course very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I like this concealer very much</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t settle into fine lines and is natural.</li>
            <li> Best of all, a little goes a long way...</li>
            <li> Lasts a really long time and is perfect for covering my dark circles!</li>
            <li> I use moisturizer first and then dab this on with a concealer brush and follow with Watts mineral powder.</li>
            <li> but I must say that since this product is SO yellow, for best results I ended up blending it in to a small amount of my Laura Mercier concealer.</li>
            <li> I guess I have more obvious circles.  </li>
            <li> Also, most brands are drying &amp; leave obvious signs of a concealer on the face.  </li>
            <li> Only deducted one star because it could be slightly more pigmented.</li>
            <li> Thank you for replacing the first one I purchased.</li>
            <li> It does not last all day as I find I have to add more as the day goes on</li>
            <li> Very glad this item is natural, I have been in the market for such a product.  </li>
            <li> It only took a small swipe/touch for my eyes to be concealed.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome, awesome product!</li>
            <li> This concealer is far too light for me-</li>
            <li> will buy it again, especially because I love the ingredients.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what it does for me.</li>
            <li> A&lt;br /&gt;FOUNDATION which better matches your skin tone (i.e. one that is not yellow)!  </li>
            <li> I will absolutely repurchase!  </li>
            <li> I lurve this product, thanks!</li>
            <li> this is the first product that I have seen that actually covers up the circles and not make them more pronounced.</li>
            <li> The first was Physicians formula</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use much of it!  </li>
            <li> I tried many different products with out real satisfaction.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very yellow tinted though so  definitely get a good  brush to blend .  </li>
            <li> I usually use it under powder makeup, but it&#x27;s good even without, just remember to blend.</li>
            <li> It is smooth, creamy, not too opaque and does not slide around or sink into fine lines like most concealers, making lines look much worse than they really are.  </li>
            <li> Often I have to do my own research to track down a product&#x27;s ingredients and it gets so time consuming.  </li>
            <li> if you have dry skin it would make your undereye wrinkles more pronounced.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, I have to put this on first to help diminish my purple veins under my eyes and then use a second concealer for my puffiness</li>
            <li> I only didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I need to put quite a bit on to have effect and it rubs off easily.</li>
            <li> I only wish it didn&#x27;t rub off so easily.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin, I&#x27;m 50 years old and have always had to deal with dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I will certainly buy it again.  </li>
            <li> Light, silky smooth makeup, easy to apply, thin or in layers.</li>
            <li> But when I tried it the color was just right for my skin tone which is fair with a slight yellow undertone.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who wants to cover their under eye circles or blemishes.</li>
            <li> This cream really does the job on covering under the eyes, blemishes.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s very generously priced for the size of product and the amount you need to use.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very yellow-tinted.</li>
            <li> This is a great concealer for blemishes, it covers them up well without harmful ingredients and without making the blemish worse.</li>
            <li> thanks god</li>
            <li> I really like the way it makes me look.</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t wear makeup, I&#x27;m not accustomed to needing to be careful about touching my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> It is very creamy.</li>
            <li> I really think that Amazon should require a listing of all ingredients from sellers for makeup and skin products.  </li>
            <li> For the amount that cosmetic companies charge for their products, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too much to ask to have them disclose what they&#x27;re asking the consumer to pay for.  </li>
            <li> Warning it is very yellow-toned, so know that going in.</li>
            <li> If I use too much primer, Watts \\&quot;slides\\&quot; off.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would perform really well since I paid so much.  </li>
            <li> I just recieved my concealer a few days ago and so far so good.</li>
            <li> the only redeeming quality is that it is natural.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s why she wears makeup at such a young age:)</li>
            <li> But when I need to even out the tone a little, this is my new favorite!</li>
            <li> I have also come to find that while my skin hates almond oil, the skin under my eyes love it and due to the almond oil in this product</li>
            <li> I love it, however, for hiding bruises and discolorations on other areas of my face, arms and legs.</li>
            <li> Much more product than other organics give you</li>
            <li> I also really like their other products that I&#x27;ve tried, and they are all very affordable and high quality. :-)</li>
            <li> It does work better as a base with foundation, but still works fine on its own.</li>
            <li> I found it to be more dry than creamy, even when I use a primer underneath directly before applying.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> Covers up the dark circles better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li> Love the make up, hides the dark areas and blemish.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive to urea (used as a preservative in cosmetics) and BHT (Butylated Hydroxytoulene which is apparently related to the toluene found in nail polish that many people are allergic to) and so, being fed up with having to check every ingredient list of every makeup and skin care product I wanted to buy, I decided to go all natural or organic.</li>
            <li> Along with a little blush and mineral powder, my whole face looks more vibrant.</li>
            <li> but over all it does a decent job.</li>
            <li> One container has lasted more than 6 months- will probably take a year of daily use to go through the entire thing.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to conceal mild or moderate circles, this could be your holy grail concealer.</li>
            <li> If I were to press my finger into it with a decent amount of pressure, it would not part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I received this product I initially thought the bright yellow color was a bit strange.  </li>
            <li> Even better, I use it under my eyes on the dark circles and they disappear!</li>
            <li> so  even though it comes in a little jar ,it&#x27;s still going, i use it every day, and when I run out I will buy more , but it has helped with my skin.</li>
            <li> Other than that it is good quality ingredients and the tone is a pale yellow which is good for dark spots.</li>
            <li> It blends well with cover up and powder and is not thick.</li>
            <li> Watts mineral foundation is great for the summer because the powder doesn&#x27;t add to the oil/sweat that unfortunately come with summer weather.  </li>
            <li> Dabbing it on under my eyes though it worked very well, I did dab two twice just to get complete coverage.</li>
            <li> can make natural make up yourself, but you don&#x27;t really end up saving any money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The yellow tone helps to cover dark circles under eyes and covers redness quite nicely as well.  </li>
            <li> I normally use a product by benefit called lemon-aid.</li>
            <li> Normal skin (not oily, not dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> long as I put some foundation over the top, the yellow disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is good at disguising dark circles, but it settles in the fine lines and looks worse than the products I was using before.  </li>
            <li> This is my new must-have.</li>
            <li> I was worried about the yellow, but it works very well under foundation and really helps cover acne and scars.</li>
            <li> It is very yellow, but light weight and would need multiple coats to see the color.</li>
            <li> Much better than I expected, would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive, but this concealer has not caused me any breakouts.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and acne prone.</li>
            <li> To begin, my skin is VERY sensitive</li>
            <li> It covers, takes very little and does not cause more break outs.</li>
            <li> I was not sure with the many reviews in buying this product...</li>
            <li> only problem with it is that it melted in my hot car.</li>
            <li> otherwise it looks pretty yellow.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Normally, I wouldn&#x27;t use concealers for the nose and cheeks because most go on a bit thick for my taste, making it look unnatural and even cakey.</li>
            <li> After using this for a few weeks my boyfriend said something along the lines of &amp;#34;I can tell you&#x27;ve been sleeping better, the circles under your eyes are barely noticeable anymore!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am in my early fifties and this is the first concealer and last concealer I will ever use.</li>
            <li> which that it hid dark circles more than it actually does.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping I don&#x27;t create more wrinkles by having to work so hard at and smoothing it out.</li>
            <li> didnt like this formula it was greasy and never dried.</li>
            <li> Also Reduces Redness &amp; Acne - Unscented and All Natural.</li>
            <li> I like he idea that it&#x27;s all natural and contains primrose oil, shea butter, jojoba, vitamin E, and rosemary.  </li>
            <li> It makes it completely disappear and does not come off until I use soap and water.</li>
            <li> My 11 year old daughter</li>
            <li> it look so cheap &amp; uneven ,, I&#x27;m a makeup artist</li>
            <li> /&gt;this combination, you can help build a surprisingly natural layered effect which</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ingredients aren&#x27;t cheap, and I find it messy and wasteful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it lasts forever because there is no waste.  </li>
            <li> and I had to tug on the delicate skin there more than I would like.  </li>
            <li> I apply it under my eyes, on my eyelids and on my smile lines next to my nose (where I tend to get red).</li>
            <li> and there is a HUGE difference between the purple under my eyes and my pale skin.</li>
            <li> this is no different or better then any other standard, and cheaper, drug store brand concealer and for that reason I&#x27;m taking away one star.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, make sure to blend it thoroughly.</li>
            <li> it ot be larger but its a small thing of concealer that is like most concealers that ive used, nothing unordinary to me</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s decent sized and will last forever.</li>
            <li> for under eyes, red spots, or lightening cheek bones.&lt;br /&gt;For those who seemed to have an issue with the consistency, just like shea butter, it softens with warmth, so: just rub your fingertip in little circles on the surface, and it will lightly cream.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> You do not need to use much so this container will go a very long way.  </li>
            <li> I used this under my eyes, it was so dry that it tugged the skin no matter how much concealer I used.</li>
            <li> The product isn&#x27;t a liquid or really a cream, it&#x27;s almost a solid like white chocolate that melts on your finger into.</li>
            <li> A little pot goes a long way and it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li> For some reason, I was expecting this to be a mineral powder concealer like Bare Minerals.  </li>
            <li> This concealer is just far too yellow to work.</li>
            <li> But I definitely recommend it thus far...</li>
            <li> The coverage is buildable and lasts all day, but because the color is similar to natural butter, I would not recommend it for anyone with a tan or darker complexion.  </li>
            <li> This product corrects redness with a yellow color when once applied blends with your natural skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I barely wear make up.</li>
            <li> This is the second &#x27;all natural&#x27; make up concealer I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> To the red inflamed skin on my cheeks, it&#x27;s all natural an moisturizing</li>
            <li> I spent too much money on this product.  </li>
            <li> concealer is smooth and thick.  </li>
            <li> This concealer glides on as a thin layer and can be layered on for more coverage.</li>
            <li> Also, it was way too light for my skin tone, and even under my thick Clinique foundation it still created horrible.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> It comes in a jar that has a false bottom to make it look like you are getting more in the jar.</li>
            <li> I use a little mineral powder over the concealer to get the right tone.  </li>
            <li> If I were a little less ghostly I&#x27;d love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> but it has a very yellow tone to it which makes it hard to blend easily into skin.  </li>
            <li> The color is fantastic; a very pale color with a tinge of yellow tone to it.  </li>
            <li> It also covers poorly, and actually draws more attention to the area I&#x27;m trying to cover.  </li>
            <li> It works very well with the dark circles and it even helps with the bags.  </li>
            <li> I like the golden yellow color, and I use it for under eye area, contouring down the sides of my nose, as a coverup for minor blemishes, and to open up the inside corners of my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive and dry skin</li>
            <li> It really covers my dark circles and doesn&#x27;t look yellow at all.</li>
            <li> I have a small area of discoloration on my shin that shows through my stockings and makes me very self conscious.</li>
            <li> Dark purple under-eye circles, thanks to my Italian side.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll do and takes less time to apply than some (due to the yellow hue), but it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li> It does tend to cake up in the small wrinkles around my eyes and underneath the bags I have, but I&#x27;m sure this is only noticeable to me when I&#x27;m scrutinizing with my face a few inches away from a mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You definitely get what you pay for with this little jar, it conceals blemishes, under eye circles without being cakey or &#x27;paint like&#x27; its smooths out really well.</li>
            <li> Another bonus is that it&#x27;s very concentrated ( a little goes a long way)  </li>
            <li> After shower I usually use shea butter all over, a natural tinted lip balm, and natural mineral powder eye shadow.</li>
            <li> She writes: \\&quot;Given genetic dark under eyes, I have tried countless products since my early teens, and this one trumps them all.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about how long this would last because the container is so tiny.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the texture although it is of a very firm consistency...just dab on with a brush and then use your ring finger to gently tap it in and then use your regular foundation.  </li>
            <li> I wear it from 6 am and last all day long.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last long on the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried concealers and they normally seem too heavy...</li>
            <li> It also seems to last a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> though I need to cake it on, it&#x27;s still lasting a very long time.</li>
            <li> The yellow really does neutralize the dark circles, but I just needed something a little lighter.</li>
            <li> I learned the hard way that organic doesn&#x27;t mean safe.  </li>
            <li> it was also a really strange orange color that i cant imagine would match anyone, i gave it away.</li>
            <li> This was a lot smaller than expected</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time and no creasing.</li>
            <li> It also stays on for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time (over 10 hours for me)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dry, and powdery - and grey.  </li>
            <li> only took off one star due to</li>
            <li> It turns out to be a yellow color, not exactly a Caucasian skin tone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have oily or dry skin</li>
            <li> It also tends to dry out my face, but that could just be my skin type.</li>
            <li> The container is tiny, but I&#x27;ve barely made a dent in it over the past couple months using it 5 days a week.</li>
            <li> it really just sort of highlights your eyes in a yellowish hue that you then have to cover up with foundation, and yet the dark circles are still there :/</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m pale so the yellow is a bit too yellow.  </li>
            <li> I am 100% Greek and have always had dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> you have only this yelow color because I have a medium dark skin.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised at the small size of this jar.</li>
            <li> This container is small but it doesn&#x27;t matter, the product will last quite a long time even with daily use&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have dark area that need coverage, use need to use something with a blue tint.</li>
            <li> This creamy concealer is very yellow and does cover dark circles</li>
            <li> I have black and red underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li> I also found the yellow tint to be an odd color.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is thick and creamy so a little bit really goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little white for me, so pick the color</li>
            <li> It is a little bit bigger than a quarter!</li>
            <li> Tiny little jar</li>
            <li> It is the same pale yellow color, it is not golden or skin toned as the picture suggests!  </li>
            <li> this  year I&#x27;ve been going  through concealer  like crazy and from the cheap to the pricey</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it heals or improves imperfections with long term use, cuz I&#x27;ve only had it about 5 days.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no cakiness or rolls</li>
            <li> It even covered a red spot I have that no concealer covered even the green</li>
            <li> It covers my minimal under eye shadowing, lasts all day, and blends well with my Dr. Hauschka translucent makeup.  </li>
            <li> I dont get whats expected</li>
            <li> Fair/porcelain skin, pink undertone.</li>
            <li> But this is a pale yellow colored CREAM concealer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about the size of a ping pong ball - only a little flatter!  </li>
            <li> It does have a yellow tint, so I typically use a little bronzer to counteract the yellowness.</li>
            <li> /flakes coming off like other concealers that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe the other reviews.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t wear any other makeup on my skin</li>
            <li> It is actually quite shallow, so you are only getting half of what it looks like you are getting.</li>
            <li> will buy again when my jar is empty!</li>
            <li> not drying like other brands although I tend to use a lot of moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I just have used standard drugstore cosmetics that work as well, if not better.  </li>
            <li> I have had no irritation or other issues when using this product.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s one of my other products, but maybe it&#x27;s the Watts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way for this product!</li>
            <li> and I both have dark circles under our eyes due to genetics and</li>
            <li> The yellow color was a little off-putting the first time i saw it, but it&#x27;s irrelevant, as it works!</li>
            <li> So this small little container will last me quite a while.</li>
            <li> I use a little stiff brush to put just a dab on little red spots and veins around my nose, and on freckles here and there.</li>
            <li> and I have bad reactions to the ingredients in most concealers, making my undereye problems much worse than simple dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I have allergies and because of this I am prone to dark circles under eyes and skin</li>
            <li> If you suffer from dark circles under eyes I would recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> Works well for dark circles under foundation</li>
            <li> Item is overpriced and not worth it</li>
            <li> Does the job of covering up dark circles.  </li>
            <li> The dark circles under my eyes are rather dark</li>
            <li> dark under eye areas.  </li>
            <li> Takes away the dark circles.</li>
            <li> This is to camouflage redness...not dark circles.  </li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t like looking as though I do heroine or got punched in the face, so I decided it was time to cover up the dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concealer works well; on a scale of 1-10, I&#x27;d say it brings my circles from a 9 to a 3.</li>
            <li> I have dark circles and some bags.  </li>
            <li> For myself, I&#x27;ve thrown out everything that contains beeswax especially mascaras where it&#x27;s a common ingredient.  </li>
            <li> It works as described and I use it to counter dark circles or any discoloration or blemish.  </li>
            <li> However, after it cooled down it solidified again and still works just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i also use it to tone down the brown splotches and spots that have come with age.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll attempt a few other tactics, but so far--not amazed.</li>
            <li> I was previously using Laura Mercier concealer that worked</li>
            <li> It counteracts the slight redness I have around my nose.  </li>
            <li> but I have no idea what half of their ingredients are.</li>
            <li> I cant wear it ,I just feel liike not ordering ever again from this site period because almost half the time I order things</li>
            <li> But this could be because I&#x27;m a few shades too dark for this product.  </li>
            <li> A little bit works well to cover up the circles.</li>
            <li> I have noticed my circles are a little lighter than before I started using this a couple of months ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dudes could use a little makeup too which is why I bought this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes along way.</li>
            <li> My dark circles are gone!</li>
            <li> I put it on and then cover it by patting on a little of my foundation.  </li>
            <li> read reviews on this before I bought it and thought \\&quot;oh, cream, this will be a little thicker than a liquid concealer.\\</li>
            <li> If I use to little, it settles into lines.</li>
            <li> tending to dark areas underneath eyes, spots &amp; slight discolorations on face, and even small blemishes &amp; scars.</li>
            <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money on this.</li>
            <li> I have trouble acne spots that seem to exist no matter what time of the month it is...</li>
            <li> I like Physician&#x27;s Formula for heavy duty spot coverage</li>
            <li> I use it but wish I could find one that zaps those circles for a few hours rather than under an hour.</li>
            <li> This is very small but it does go a long way!!</li>
            <li> I think thats not a good idea especially for the under eye area which is a delicate area to begin with.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit worried after reading the reviews about how small the jar is, and it is small but seems on par to me with the average size of concealers.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not easy to cover up.  </li>
            <li> Cream foundation just smears all over my face like a messy oil slick in the summer.  </li>
            <li> impossible to set with a mineral foundation, gets really cakey looking.</li>
            <li> Just apply a little would serve the purpose!</li>
            <li> Even tough is very small I think is going to last a lot since all I have to use is a very little quantity</li>
            <li> I use very, very little each day even though I apply it liberally with a concealer brush.</li>
            <li> I apply the concealer with a small concealer brush.  </li>
            <li> Been using it for the past 10 or so years.</li>
            <li> This product works just as well if not better @</li>
            <li> 1 small swipe with a concealer brush is all I need.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t come back, assume I failed in my mission.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin skin, especially under my eyes, so I found this formula a little too thick for using as an under-eye concealer.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty bad genetic under eye circles that are impossible to cover up completely.</li>
            <li> Its not creamy and its hard to apply.  </li>
            <li> but when I use this product without lotion, moisturizer, toner or anything, it&#x27;s hard to blend in.</li>
            <li> I hardly have to use anything...just tap my finger on the surface.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this concealer was very dry.</li>
            <li> It is thick and covers well.  </li>
            <li> This product comes in a small container!</li>
            <li> this one is very thick and hard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick, which frustrates me using it around the delicate skin of my eyes (I feel like I have to tug at the skin to blend it).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving the product 2 stars only because if you&#x27;re not allergic to beeswax, this isn&#x27;t a bad concealer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not a good product I use it for my self</li>
            <li> This product is 100% natural and the base is made with waxes, not synthetic oils, so it does not clog pores or make milia under the eyes.  </li>
            <li> Have used several high-end products that disappointed.</li>
            <li> The concealer is very hard and does not blend well.</li>
            <li> but after a few months it got really hard and impossible to use without heating it up with the blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I have no problems with mychelle creamy stick concealer which is also very thick.</li>
            <li> It does well to level out the redness, but it is a very thick product.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a cream, a very thick cream</li>
            <li> I put it very thick in the circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cream, but it&#x27;s very thick.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s just thin undereye skin.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this product&lt;br</li>
            <li> If anything, the redness in my face has decreased since I started using this concealer.</li>
            <li> and I mean awful dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have horrible under eye circles and have tried just about everything, but this product actually works.</li>
            <li> the oils aren&#x27;t making my acne/ redness worse!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> It was cakey and difficult to blend.</li>
            <li> &quot; Wrong.</li>
            <li> small but annoying.</li>
            <li> and it was expensive and watery!</li>
            <li> My skin has been awful lately , I usually  don&#x27;t wear makeup but</li>
            <li> It takes 2 or 3 layers to cover up the  really bad spots.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My skin type is fair with a cool undertone.  I have allergies and because of this I am prone to dark circles under eyes and skin redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This concealer is smooth and thick.  It provides good coverage.  The yellow tone helps to cover dark circles under eyes and covers redness quite nicely as well.  My skin is very sensitive, but this concealer has not caused me any breakouts.  If you suffer from dark circles under eyes I would recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> Works well for dark circles under foundation but if I put too much on, it settles into the fine lines and makes them more noticeable. Use sparingly.</li>
            <li> didnt like this formula it was greasy and never dried. it was also a really strange orange color that i cant imagine would match anyone, i gave it away.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I have awful and I mean awful dark circles. I think it&#x27;s just thin undereye skin. I tried many different products with out real satisfaction. I would have to continually reapply the product and it would look obvious by the end of the day. This however works great. I apply it maybe twice a day. It blends well with cover up and powder and is not thick. A little bit works well to cover up the circles. I&#x27;m glad I finally found a great product and the price is right!</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way for this product! It is great for getting rid of redness and under eye circles. I use moisturizer first and then dab this on with a concealer brush and follow with Watts mineral powder. Works perfectly!</li>
            <li> I was worried about the yellow, but it works very well under foundation and really helps cover acne and scars. It also helps reduce inflammation from acne, which is great!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have horrible under eye circles and have tried just about everything, but this product actually works. It is quite yellow but covers blemishes wonderfully and hides my under eye circles. I use this under my normal cover up (Liquid then powder) and it works beautifully. I recommend this to anyone who wants to cover their under eye circles or blemishes. However, it might not be right for all skin shades and types (I have fair, normal skin).</li>
            <li> I have pretty bad genetic under eye circles that are impossible to cover up completely. This is more than likely due to me also having fair skin and there is a HUGE difference between the purple under my eyes and my pale skin. I was previously using Laura Mercier concealer that worked ok but after a few months it got really hard and impossible to use without heating it up with the blow dryer. So after looking at all the reviews here I decided to give this a try since it does not cost a lot. It has a really nice consistency which I love but I must say that since this product is SO yellow, for best results I ended up blending it in to a small amount of my Laura Mercier concealer. This duo works amazingly and if I set the concealer afterwards with a setting powder that has some shimmer to it (I use Kores mineral setting powder under my eyes only) then I can honestly say this is absolutely the best under eye concealer combo I have found!! I have also come to find that while my skin hates almond oil, the skin under my eyes love it and due to the almond oil in this product I have noticed my circles are a little lighter than before I started using this a couple of months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only took off one star due to I am acne prone and tried using it on a few acne scars which covered wonderfully by the way, but it inflamed my skin and gave my big Cysts where I applied it.</li>
            <li> very good lasting coverage.  I thought it was a mineral concealer but after I read the ingredients I knew it was a cream concealer.  It has natural ingredients and great for under eye or blemishes.</li>
            <li> This was a lot smaller than expected and I expecte it ot be larger but its a small thing of concealer that is like most concealers that ive used, nothing unordinary to me</li>
            <li> I dont like this product at all.  Its not creamy and its hard to apply.  I think thats not a good idea especially for the under eye area which is a delicate area to begin with.  they need to add something to make this product smooth to apply.  I do not recommend this item</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this product&lt;br /&gt;The color is correct but it came feeling old&lt;br /&gt;Hard to use correctly&lt;br /&gt;Not happy at all&lt;br /&gt;Still in my drawer unused</li>
            <li> For some reason, I was expecting this to be a mineral powder concealer like Bare Minerals.  But this is a pale yellow colored CREAM concealer.  The yellow color is not at all obvious on the skin.  It counteracts the slight redness I have around my nose.  I am also happy with the coverage under my eyes.  But I find that the coverage is best when I apply two coats under my eyes.  I guess I have more obvious circles.  Luckily, the cream is so smooth.  There is absolutely no cakiness or rolls/flakes coming off like other concealers that I&#x27;ve used.  The formula is creamy &amp; smooth without being oily.  This is the first time I am happy all around with a concealer, and that&#x27;s saying a lot since I have used about 20 different brands including Tarte &amp; Elysee which are my favorite brands.  Also, most brands are drying &amp; leave obvious signs of a concealer on the face.  This Watts brand is not drying, blends right in with the skin, and does not emphasize fine lines.  I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concealer is the first cosmetic I put on my face so that it blends nicely with the face cream and eye cream that have just been absorbed into my skin.  I apply the concealer with a small concealer brush.  Then I blot my face with powder/blotting tissues to get rid of the shine and spritz with Urban Decay&#x27;s De-Slick before I put on my foundation.  Watts mineral foundation is great for the summer because the powder doesn&#x27;t add to the oil/sweat that unfortunately come with summer weather.  Cream foundation just smears all over my face like a messy oil slick in the summer.  Don&#x27;t forget to spritz again with De-Slick as the last step to lock in your makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me a while to try this concealer, but I am SO Glad I did!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the product.  It has great coverage of under eye circles and easy to apply. Smooth texture.  Easy to blend in.  I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> great for concealing red marks and I use it to hide discolorations on my eye lids.</li>
            <li> I love this concealer I have two sisters they both tried it and they both ordered it</li>
            <li> This cream really does the job on covering under the eyes, blemishes. It&#x27;s a little white for me, so pick the color right. I still like it.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin, I&#x27;m 50 years old and have always had to deal with dark circles under my eyes.  I use this under mineral makeup which I think holds it in place.  I don&#x27;t have any issues with caking or cracking that you get with an oily concealer.</li>
            <li> If you have what&#x27;s considered fair skin by most products (BE fairly light/fair, Almay light, etc.), this concealer will most-likely work well for you. This concealer glides on as a thin layer and can be layered on for more coverage. Normally, I wouldn&#x27;t use concealers for the nose and cheeks because most go on a bit thick for my taste, making it look unnatural and even cakey. However, I love using this one to lighten up freckles, eliminate redness, and even out skin tone. I have only been using it for about a week in the winter so I don&#x27;t know how well this will do in hotter weather. Most importantly, my sensitive skin has not had one single pimple the whole time I have been using this in conjunction with the Watts Beauty Minerals in Fair. BE --&gt; Pimples; small but annoying. Watts --&gt; No pimples so far, all natural and a great price. Watts wins!!!</li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t beat this. The texture is indescribable. Like creme silk. Blends in naturally and amazingly. I thought this would be powder minerals, but I still am not dissapointed. Only deducted one star because it could be slightly more pigmented. It takes 2 or 3 layers to cover up the  really bad spots.</li>
            <li> Incredible product at an incredible price! Use with a concealer brush and set immediately with translucent powder. Lasts a long time and no creasing. I have sensitive and dry skin but this gives me no issues. Have used several high-end products that disappointed. This is my new must-have.</li>
            <li> For me, the pros greatly outweigh the cons, so I would highly recommend this concealer to people with light to medium skin tones.&lt;br /&gt;You can see pictures and my Pros / Cons at [...]</li>
            <li> Thank you for replacing the first one I purchased. There was a significant difference. I am very pleased with all of your products</li>
            <li> If you want a dip your finger in, creamy concealer, this is not for you. This product was supposed to be very soft and easy to apply. I wanted it to conceal the bags under my eyes. Unfortunately, this concealer was very dry. I couldn&#x27;t even get enough on my finger to do any good at first, and when I did, the concealer wasn&#x27;t even great. Would not recommend. Don&#x27;t believe the other reviews.</li>
            <li> The concealer is very hard and does not blend well. Packaging is cheap. Item is overpriced and not worth it</li>
            <li> This concealer is great, I use it under the eyes and on blemishes and red spots. I usually use it under powder makeup, but it&#x27;s good even without, just remember to blend.</li>
            <li> After using this for a few weeks my boyfriend said something along the lines of &amp;#34;I can tell you&#x27;ve been sleeping better, the circles under your eyes are barely noticeable anymore!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m the palest person I know and the color blends right in and I don&#x27;t wear any other makeup on my skin so I feel qualified to say that it&#x27;s great for that &amp;#34;no makeup&amp;#34; while wearing makeup scheme some of us pull.</li>
            <li> This concealer covers nicely, goes on easily and lasts a decent amount of time  .  It does not last all day as I find I have to add more as the day goes on but over all it does a decent job.</li>
            <li> I just recieved my concealer a few days ago and so far so good. It doesnt break me out. My skin is very sensitive and acne prone. I like it because I&#x27;m  light skinned and i need light coverage for scars. It matches my fair skin tone. If my acne is too red though, it does not cover. Once they are kinda gone it works perfect and makes my skin look nice. Not cakey or pasty.</li>
            <li> I am 100% Greek and have always had dark circles under my eyes. I have used everything on the market,but nothing has worked. After reading the reviews, I decided to give this product a try. I followed the directions, and applied it morning and night for around a month, and no improvement whatsoever. It did nothing for my undereye bags either. It comes in a jar that has a false bottom to make it look like you are getting more in the jar. It is actually quite shallow, so you are only getting half of what it looks like you are getting. if your circles are not severe like mine, it may work for you, but I will continue my search.</li>
            <li> It turns out to be a yellow color, not exactly a Caucasian skin tone.</li>
            <li> what colors do you have at this product, Watts Beauty Mineral Multi Use Under Eye Concealer / Also Reduces Redness &amp; Acne - Unscented and All Natural. you have only this yelow color because I have a medium dark skin. thank you!</li>
            <li> This works so well on my undereye area! I love it! I was worried it would be too yellow and not blend well with my skin tone (which is very fair / red tone in some areas) but the brightness of it actually looks great underneath my eyes. Covers up the dark circles better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have oily or dry skin but when I use this product without lotion, moisturizer, toner or anything, it&#x27;s hard to blend in.</li>
            <li> Very glad this item is natural, I have been in the market for such a product.  Having said that, this is the GREASIEST product I have ever put on my face.  I could actually see it from the corner of my eye when I used it as a concealer!  This was a huge dissapointment, I really wanted it to work.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised at the small size of this jar. It is a little bit bigger than a quarter! I have tried it and it covers ok. Not the super wonder of the world coverup as stated in some reviews! Things are not as they seem! Beware!</li>
            <li> I have used many concealers before but I like this one a lot, because it&#x27;s very gentle on my skin. The only complain is that it does&#x27;nt moistrurize so make sure you sure a good moisturizer u apply this</li>
            <li> Dudes could use a little makeup too which is why I bought this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife took it over so I decided I would like one in my own bathroom so I ordered another one just now.</li>
            <li> I was not sure with the many reviews in buying this product... I have always used MAC concealer and decided to try this... and to my amazement, it is a great product. It does work better as a base with foundation, but still works fine on its own. It also stays on for a long period of time. I would suggest this to anyone who needs brightening around and under the eye. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have terrible under eye circles to where i&#x27;m looking to get surgery and this product helps big time. will buy again when my jar is empty!</li>
            <li> Does the job of covering up dark circles.  Stays for many hours, blends in nicely and does not dry your skin!  Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a yellow cream concealer.  I have been very happy with it. I think it&#x27;s very generously priced for the size of product and the amount you need to use. It really covers my dark circles and doesn&#x27;t look yellow at all. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all. It also seems to last a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem with it is that it melted in my hot car. However, after it cooled down it solidified again and still works just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m planning to buy it again. I also really like their other products that I&#x27;ve tried, and they are all very affordable and high quality. :-)</li>
            <li> the color is super opaque bright yellow. even on a fair skin it is too light. impossible to set with a mineral foundation, gets really cakey looking. I have no problems with mychelle creamy stick concealer which is also very thick. but mychelle is more moisturizing and easy to spread. this one is very thick and hard. if you have dry skin it would make your undereye wrinkles more pronounced. the only redeeming quality is that it is natural.</li>
            <li> Works well at covering any red spots (you learn in makeup to cover red marks with yellow tints) but i bought it for under eye darkness, and for that...it&#x27;s not so effective. It looks somewhat unnaturally light and draws attention to my under-eye rather than covering it. You can tell I have it on. I&#x27;m disappointed that it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I like the golden yellow color, and I use it for under eye area, contouring down the sides of my nose, as a coverup for minor blemishes, and to open up the inside corners of my eyes.  I run it from the inner corner of my eye up to the eyebrown to lighten the area and \\&quot;wake it up.\\&quot;  I like he idea that it&#x27;s all natural and contains primrose oil, shea butter, jojoba, vitamin E, and rosemary.  This is something I&#x27;d reorder when needed, but it&#x27;s lasting me a while.</li>
            <li> This concealer is just far too yellow to work. Your undereye circles will not be concealed; rather, they will just look yellow.</li>
            <li> Works great at covering up red spots, and I love that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> I do like that it is made alleged of natural products. Makes me feel good about the product. A good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it 2 days so will update. It is very yellow, but light weight and would need multiple coats to see the color. I used it under eye, on eyelids and blemishes. Under eye okay, didn&#x27;t like for eyelids creased too quickly and blemishes so-so.</li>
            <li> Very nice. I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I normally use a product by benefit called lemon-aid. Been using it for the past 10 or so years. When I found this product for half the price with its great reviews, I decided to try it since the description made it sound almost identical.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad i did! This product works just as well if not better @ tending to dark areas underneath eyes, spots &amp; slight discolorations on face, and even small blemishes &amp; scars. I&#x27;m not sure if it heals or improves imperfections with long term use, cuz I&#x27;ve only had it about 5 days. But I definitely recommend it thus far...</li>
            <li> This product comes in a small container! but All I have to say is yes it works. It&#x27;s worth trying. I&#x27;m definitely going to continue to stick with this product!</li>
            <li> This does not give super strong coverage- many of the reviews said it was totally amazing. It is nice, but not a miracle worker. For the price, worth a try.</li>
            <li> I have very thin skin, especially under my eyes, so I found this formula a little too thick for using as an under-eye concealer.  I love it, however, for hiding bruises and discolorations on other areas of my face, arms and legs. I have a small area of discoloration on my shin that shows through my stockings and makes me very self conscious. I have tried numerous concealers on this area and never found one I liked until I tried Watts. It makes it completely disappear and does not come off until I use soap and water. An added benefit is that Watts&#x27; concealer is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin :)</li>
            <li> This is the best concealer I have ever used, and I have tried many.  To begin, my skin is VERY sensitive and I have bad reactions to the ingredients in most concealers, making my undereye problems much worse than simple dark circles.  This product is 100% natural and the base is made with waxes, not synthetic oils, so it does not clog pores or make milia under the eyes.  It is smooth, creamy, not too opaque and does not slide around or sink into fine lines like most concealers, making lines look much worse than they really are.  The coverage is buildable and lasts all day, but because the color is similar to natural butter, I would not recommend it for anyone with a tan or darker complexion.  I will be ordering more of this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I wear it from 6 am and last all day long. Covers perfectly all imperfections. Even tough is very small I think is going to last a lot since all I have to use is a very little quantity</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best under-eye concealer I have ever used. Buy more then one, I believe they sell-out pretty fast. I am in my early fifties and this is the first concealer and last concealer I will ever use. Watts, please keep making your magical concealer, it is awesome. 1 small swipe with a concealer brush is all I need. A little goes along way. I have black and red underneath my eyes. It only took a small swipe/touch for my eyes to be concealed.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome, awesome product!</li>
            <li> I was expecting this to be more like a tinted moisturizer in consistency when it said cream...but it almost had the consistency of a crayon type concealer. I hardly have to use anything...just tap my finger on the surface. It is a great base for my mineral foundation and BEST of all...the oils aren&#x27;t making my acne/ redness worse! If anything, the redness in my face has decreased since I started using this concealer. It does have a yellow tint, so I typically use a little bronzer to counteract the yellowness. Much better than I expected, would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This product corrects redness with a yellow color when once applied blends with your natural skin tone.  And it lasts!  Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.. I use it for under eye concealer but it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of good coverage. The dark circles under my eyes are rather dark so it might be that I need to use more than two layers of concealer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick, which frustrates me using it around the delicate skin of my eyes (I feel like I have to tug at the skin to blend it). Other than that it is good quality ingredients and the tone is a pale yellow which is good for dark spots. It works fine when I pre mix it with concelear for texture, but I don&#x27;t have paitence to do that every day. I hope they consider making this product thinner in the future.</li>
            <li> This creamy concealer is comparable to benefit&#x27;s lemon aid.. It is the same pale yellow color, it is not golden or skin toned as the picture suggests!  I mixed it with a cream concealer that I had that was a tad too dark for me and the result is beautiful!!  It brightens up my under eye very nicely, and I also use it as a lid primer &#x3D;)  For the ladies that know how to contour and highlight your face, this is a good highlighter bc it blends in very easily and looks natural, not too make-upey.. Very pleased with this purchase!  For reference, I have a medium golden skin tone.. Porcelain ladies will probably not use this as a highlighter.. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> My son uses it to cover acne. It is one of the best we have tried. It covers, takes very little and does not cause more break outs.</li>
            <li> I have medium-beige skin, with yellow undertones.  This concealer is far too light for me- I wouldn&#x27;t use this unless you have extremely fair skin.  When I use it, it looks I rubbed some Elmer&#x27;s glue onto my face.  It also covers poorly, and actually draws more attention to the area I&#x27;m trying to cover.  But this could be because I&#x27;m a few shades too dark for this product.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money on this.</li>
            <li> Works well to cover my under-eye circles and redness. I lightly dust it with a mineral foundation after application which helps to blend the color- otherwise it looks pretty yellow. One container has lasted more than 6 months- will probably take a year of daily use to go through the entire thing. Neutral smell (similar to beeswax)</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried after reading the reviews about how small the jar is, and it is small but seems on par to me with the average size of concealers.  The product isn&#x27;t a liquid or really a cream, it&#x27;s almost a solid like white chocolate that melts on your finger into. I haven&#x27;t tried it on a concealer brush yet to see how it applies with that.  Dabbing it on under my eyes though it worked very well, I did dab two twice just to get complete coverage. It doesn&#x27;t make me look like I have anything on but makes it look like I got a full nights sleep.  It even covered a red spot I have that no concealer covered even the green ones.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again, especially because I love the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with this product. It&#x27;s &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34;, meaning it doesn&#x27;t smooth very well. I&#x27;m hoping I don&#x27;t create more wrinkles by having to work so hard at and smoothing it out. It&#x27;s also very yellow-tinted.</li>
            <li> My 11 year old daughter and I both have dark circles under our eyes due to genetics and this is a great product to wear under our makeup! FYI she is a dancer so that&#x27;s why she wears makeup at such a young age:)</li>
            <li> I have medium beige skin with yellow undertones.  I use this under my medium mineral foundation.  It works great.  I noticed another reviewer said it was too light for their skin.  I&#x27;ve been taught in makeup classes your concealer should be a shade lighter than your foundation to properly hide your imperfections and brighten your under eyes.  This is exactly what it does for me.</li>
            <li> Cream concealer? On what planet?&lt;br /&gt;When I used this under my eyes, it was so dry that it tugged the skin no matter how much concealer I used. Also, it was way too light for my skin tone, and even under my thick Clinique foundation it still created horrible.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the price. It went into the trash.</li>
            <li> loved it! covered my purple circles and i have really bad ones. i put it under my foundation and they were all gone!</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, I have to put this on first to help diminish my purple veins under my eyes and then use a second concealer for my puffiness but this works great covering the purple. Doesn&#x27;t budge or smear or crumble up. I would most defiantly buy again.</li>
            <li> This really is great stuff.  Perfect consistency, great coverage, doesn&#x27;t settle into lines, just the right amount of creaminess, etc...  But I&#x27;m pale so the yellow is a bit too yellow.  I would LOVE to see this exact same product in a fair tone (either a light yellow for under makeup or just a skin tone color).  The yellow is just too yellow and it&#x27;s not easy to cover up.  If I were a little less ghostly I&#x27;d love this stuff.  If you&#x27;re always buying in the bottom two categories for makeup colors (you know, fair, light, etc...) this might be too yellow for you as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try mixing this up with something else and maybe I&#x27;ll have some luck.  If I do, I&#x27;ll post it here.  If I don&#x27;t come back, assume I failed in my mission.  :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE***  I mixed this with a WHITE concealer of a similar consistency and that makes it work for me.  The yellow really does neutralize the dark circles, but I just needed something a little lighter.</li>
            <li> I put this on after moisturizer and before mineral makeup. I apply it under my eyes, on my eyelids and on my smile lines next to my nose (where I tend to get red). I didn&#x27;t realize my eyelids were being minimized because of darkness until I applied this. It makes me look much perkier. :-) Some people posted that it&#x27;s a really tiny container. I think it&#x27;s decent sized and will last forever. I use very, very little each day even though I apply it liberally with a concealer brush.</li>
            <li> This is a great concealer for blemishes, it covers them up well without harmful ingredients and without making the blemish worse. The consistency is thick and creamy so a little bit really goes a long way. It lasts a long time (over 10 hours for me) so reapplication is not necessary.&lt;br /&gt;I do not use it under my eyes because I&#x27;m too fair and the yellow color looked funny on me.&lt;br /&gt;However, as much as I do like this,  this is no different or better then any other standard, and cheaper, drug store brand concealer and for that reason I&#x27;m taking away one star.</li>
            <li> It does well to level out the redness, but it is a very thick product. It also tends to dry out my face, but that could just be my skin type.</li>
            <li> Wow! Really amazing!! I don&#x27;t EVER write reviews but thought I should for this product. I have trouble acne spots that seem to exist no matter what time of the month it is... I&#x27;ve tried concealers and they normally seem too heavy... Making my dang pimple seem to stick out even farther than it actually is. But this stuff is so airy, it feels like i&#x27;m not wearing it at all! Even better, I use it under my eyes on the dark circles and they disappear! Truly a great product! Best of all, a little goes a long way... So this small little container will last me quite a while. Hope this helped :)</li>
            <li> Great product!!! works wonders hiding pimple scars and I feel that they get better with time with this concealer. I love that it is natural and the color matches my skin very well.  I will certainly buy it again.  The price is very reasonable and of course very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not a good product I use it for my self it look so cheap &amp; uneven ,, I&#x27;m a makeup artist thanks god I didn&#x27;t use it for my client ,, it&#x27;s bull s***,,</li>
            <li> This resembles the maybelline/physician&#x27;s formula yellow makeup sticks that help&lt;br /&gt;conceal dark under eye areas.  I love all of the very natural ingredients and I love that it&lt;br /&gt;is not drying like other brands although I tend to use a lot of moisturizer.  For those of you concerned&lt;br /&gt;about the color PLEASE KNOW THIS SHOULD BE USED UNDER AN ADDITIONAL CONCEALER AND/OR A&lt;br /&gt;FOUNDATION which better matches your skin tone (i.e. one that is not yellow)!  With&lt;br /&gt;this combination, you can help build a surprisingly natural layered effect which&lt;br /&gt;works great to hide dark circles.  I will absolutely repurchase!  Please don&#x27;t stop making this!</li>
            <li> It says mineral but it&#x27;s a cream, a very thick cream</li>
            <li> This concealer works for me.  I find it best to apply with a clean lipstick brush.  I like the idea that the product both conceals and heals the skin.</li>
            <li> Been looking for makeup without the junk. Works great. Very happy. Creamy, bright. Works! Use it every day and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Just apply a little would serve the purpose! I ordered this by a mistake, yet, never regret the mistake I made.</li>
            <li> This container is small but it doesn&#x27;t matter, the product will last quite a long time even with daily use&lt;br /&gt; use under eyes and on blemishes befor foundation for a flawless face. Use with highlighter/foundation/ bronzer for a sculpted look. Awesome product and well with the price</li>
            <li> When I received this product I initially thought the bright yellow color was a bit strange.  But when I tried it the color was just right for my skin tone which is fair with a slight yellow undertone. I suspect it would be too light for any darker skin tones.  It covers my minimal under eye shadowing, lasts all day, and blends well with my Dr. Hauschka translucent makeup.  When Burt&#x27;s Bees discontinued their great under eye concealer I dispaired of ever finding anything I liked as well, however I really like this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I really like the way it makes me look. Takes away the dark circles. Under my moisturizer it is perfect</li>
            <li> I love the creamy texture of this concealer.  It looks yellow, but with a &amp;#34;Bare Minerals&amp;#34; type of powder, it blends in so well.  My dark circles are gone! Yea.  Much more product than other organics give you and it&#x27;s the same price.  It was shipped quickly, and in one piece.  Yea!</li>
            <li> Great texture. Light, silky smooth makeup, easy to apply, thin or in layers. Non-comedogenic, and I do not say that LIGHTLY! Many things that say that on their packing have proved to be lying about it to me! I must have a yellow toned skin because I have found it is the best tint for all of my  \\&quot;cover ups\\&quot; not just dark circles...Cake-like, not powdery.</li>
            <li> I lurve this product, thanks!</li>
            <li> This is very small but it does go a long way!! Also it is not cakey one bit&lt;br /&gt;Love love love love love:)</li>
            <li> Lasts a really long time and is perfect for covering my dark circles! A little goes a long way, make sure to blend it thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Love the make up, hides the dark areas and blemish. My mineral make up flows nicely over it. Would order again.</li>
            <li> I like this concealer very much it covers well but it has a very yellow tone to it which makes it hard to blend easily into skin.  I use a little mineral powder over the concealer to get the right tone.  This is the only problem with this concealer.  I do like the ingredients.  I am trying to use the most natural products I can find and this one is good.</li>
            <li> Excellent concealer for all skin types. Coverage is great. Goes on smoothly and lasts all day long. For those of you whom are darker, this concealer works equally great. After application of this, just apply your foundation or mineral powder for skin tone matching perfection! Great food for your skin and purchase!</li>
            <li> this is the first product that I have seen that actually covers up the circles and not make them more pronounced.</li>
            <li> I barely wear make up. After shower I usually use shea butter all over, a natural tinted lip balm, and natural mineral powder eye shadow. But when I need to even out the tone a little, this is my new favorite! for under eyes, red spots, or lightening cheek bones.&lt;br /&gt;For those who seemed to have an issue with the consistency, just like shea butter, it softens with warmth, so: just rub your fingertip in little circles on the surface, and it will lightly cream.&lt;br /&gt;You can make natural make up yourself, but you don&#x27;t really end up saving any money.&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients aren&#x27;t cheap, and I find it messy and wasteful.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to get my little jar of pretty skin in the mail. But, how about some more colors? Brown, Red, Violet?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the texture although it is of a very firm consistency...just dab on with a brush and then use your ring finger to gently tap it in and then use your regular foundation.  I just have used standard drugstore cosmetics that work as well, if not better.  This is to camouflage redness...not dark circles.  If you have dark area that need coverage, use need to use something with a blue tint.</li>
            <li> My wife LOVES this product! She writes: \\&quot;Given genetic dark under eyes, I have tried countless products since my early teens, and this one trumps them all. i also use it to tone down the brown splotches and spots that have come with age. Along with a little blush and mineral powder, my whole face looks more vibrant. I also find that the sun protection makes a difference - with a wide-brimmed hat or visor, I don&#x27;t need sun screen, which I hate to put on my face. The yellow color was a little off-putting the first time i saw it, but it&#x27;s irrelevant, as it works! I&#x27;ve used it for years now, and my only concern is that it might become unavailable!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  It has excellent coverage.  It&#x27;s yellow in tint.  I put it on and then cover it by patting on a little of my foundation.  I put it very thick in the circles under my eyes.  It stays put and does not settle into wrinkles.  That is the most remarkable thing about this product.  It is thick and covers well.  That allows you to not have to use a lot of it, either.  I was concerned about how long this would last because the container is so tiny.  It&#x27;s about the size of a ping pong ball - only a little flatter!  I believe it will last for quite some time.  This has the best coverage of any concealer I&#x27;ve ever used.  The price is not bad, either.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this. Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me. It doesn&#x27;t last all day. It will cover the redness but my skin looked unnatural. It was cakey and difficult to blend.</li>
            <li> Best natural ingredient concealer I&#x27;ve come across.  Feels wonderful, applies smoothly, and is great for muting facial redness and under-eye circles.  I like Physician&#x27;s Formula for heavy duty spot coverage but I have no idea what half of their ingredients are.</li>
            <li> This is the second &#x27;all natural&#x27; make up concealer I&#x27;ve bought. The first was Physicians formula and it was expensive and watery! You definitely get what you pay for with this little jar, it conceals blemishes, under eye circles without being cakey or &#x27;paint like&#x27; its smooths out really well. When I run out I will definitely be buying again!</li>
            <li> Aside from my recent use of eye products, I&#x27;ve never worn makeup. But I don&#x27;t like looking as though I do heroine or got punched in the face, so I decided it was time to cover up the dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concealer works well; on a scale of 1-10, I&#x27;d say it brings my circles from a 9 to a 3. That&#x27;s very good. I only didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I need to put quite a bit on to have effect and it rubs off easily. Since I don&#x27;t wear makeup, I&#x27;m not accustomed to needing to be careful about touching my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I need to cake it on, it&#x27;s still lasting a very long time. The container is tiny, but I&#x27;ve barely made a dent in it over the past couple months using it 5 days a week. It&#x27;s fairly easy to get the hang of blending it in. It does tend to cake up in the small wrinkles around my eyes and underneath the bags I have, but I&#x27;m sure this is only noticeable to me when I&#x27;m scrutinizing with my face a few inches away from a mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like the product. I only wish it didn&#x27;t rub off so easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dry, and powdery - and grey.  Unnatural - ouch.</li>
            <li> Kind of a yellowish tint.</li>
            <li> My skin has been awful lately , I usually  don&#x27;t wear makeup but this  year I&#x27;ve been going  through concealer  like crazy and from the cheap to the pricey their all about the same . However this stuff. Manages to help both with the puffiness of my under  eyes. To the red inflamed skin on my cheeks, it&#x27;s all natural an moisturizing so my skin can breath. It&#x27;s very yellow tinted though so  definitely get a good  brush to blend .  Another bonus is that it&#x27;s very concentrated ( a little goes a long way)  so  even though it comes in a little jar ,it&#x27;s still going, i use it every day, and when I run out I will buy more , but it has helped with my skin.</li>
            <li> Its chalky and yellow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and I cant wear it ,I just feel liike not ordering ever again from this site period because almost half the time I order things I dont get whats expected</li>
            <li> Not what I thought  I was ordering</li>
            <li> This creamy concealer is very yellow and does cover dark circles but it doesn&#x27;t last long on the skin. My circles start peeking through in 30 minutes. I do use Ben Nye Banana Powder over it for staying power but still the concealer wears off. This concealer is probably great for mild to moderate circles but mine are deep and no concealer really covers them. I do like this one though. It doesn&#x27;t settle into fine lines and is natural. I use it but wish I could find one that zaps those circles for a few hours rather than under an hour. I have had no irritation or other issues when using this product. A little pot goes a long way and it&#x27;s easy to apply. If you&#x27;re looking to conceal mild or moderate circles, this could be your holy grail concealer. I wish I could find mine!</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  Make sure that your under eye is well nourished and then use a good stipple (?) brush.  Not a lot in the jar, but use a brush and it lasts forever because there is no waste.  Sometimes I just pick up the brush and use leftovers.  Good product.</li>
            <li> I really like this. It is very creamy. The color is awesome and brightens the under eye area.  I have dark circles and some bags.  It works very well with the dark circles and it even helps with the bags.  D0 use a light hand when applying.  I like to apply it before my foundation. It does not appear to settle into my fine lines if I do this.  The color is fantastic; a very pale color with a tinge of yellow tone to it.  My skin tone is very fair.  I am 55 so I guess I can&#x27;t expect a miracle.  But, it is the best concealer I have ever used and believe me I have tried a LOT of concealers! I think the search is OVER!  Yaaaaaaaaay!  :)</li>
            <li> Tiny little jar but it will last years.  I use a little stiff brush to put just a dab on little red spots and veins around my nose, and on freckles here and there.</li>
            <li> which that it hid dark circles more than it actually does.  it really just sort of highlights your eyes in a yellowish hue that you then have to cover up with foundation, and yet the dark circles are still there :/</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive to urea (used as a preservative in cosmetics) and BHT (Butylated Hydroxytoulene which is apparently related to the toluene found in nail polish that many people are allergic to) and so, being fed up with having to check every ingredient list of every makeup and skin care product I wanted to buy, I decided to go all natural or organic. I learned the hard way that organic doesn&#x27;t mean safe.  It turns out that I am one of many individuals allergic to beeswax.  After using this product and an eye cream that contained beeswax, my eyes were swollen and red.  I couldn&#x27;t understand what was happening until I did my own research and found many people complaining about irritated lips and skin after using products containing beeswax.  The pictures I saw looked exactly like the kind of redness and swelling that&#x27;s on my eyelids and beneath my eyes where the eye cream was used.  I&#x27;m giving the product 2 stars only because if you&#x27;re not allergic to beeswax, this isn&#x27;t a bad concealer.  For myself, I&#x27;ve thrown out everything that contains beeswax especially mascaras where it&#x27;s a common ingredient.  For my eye area, I&#x27;m now looking for vegan products.  My understanding is that if a product is vegan it won&#x27;t use beeswax since that&#x27;s considered a product of an animal?  I&#x27;d suggest checking the ingredients anyway.  I really think that Amazon should require a listing of all ingredients from sellers for makeup and skin products.  Often I have to do my own research to track down a product&#x27;s ingredients and it gets so time consuming.  For the amount that cosmetic companies charge for their products, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too much to ask to have them disclose what they&#x27;re asking the consumer to pay for.  And if people can be allergic to beeswax, the sellers should have a warning about this in their product description.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use much of it!  It is for my daughter!!</li>
            <li> Wow, for an organic concealer this is great option and creamy. Warning it is very yellow-toned, so know that going in. Also, it isn&#x27;t build-able so apply with a traditional concealer brush the amount you want then pat out with a fluffier concealer brush (like sigma brush p84). Improves the overall skin condition</li>
            <li> Me: 20ish. Fair/porcelain skin, pink undertone. Dark purple under-eye circles, thanks to my Italian side. Normal skin (not oily, not dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thick, almost like clay:&lt;br /&gt;I read reviews on this before I bought it and thought \\&quot;oh, cream, this will be a little thicker than a liquid concealer.\\&quot; Wrong. It&#x27;s a cream, but it&#x27;s very thick. If I were to press my finger into it with a decent amount of pressure, it would not part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still settles in lines with primer:&lt;br /&gt;I use a moisturizer, let it sink in, then Palladio primer, then Watts with my ring finger, then \\&quot;thickish\\&quot; cream foundation. If I use too much primer, Watts \\&quot;slides\\&quot; off. If I use to little, it settles into lines. If I use none, it settles in even deeper. Maybe it&#x27;s one of my other products, but maybe it&#x27;s the Watts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good color for light skin tones:&lt;br /&gt;As long as I put some foundation over the top, the yellow disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll attempt a few other tactics, but so far--not amazed. It&#x27;ll do and takes less time to apply than some (due to the yellow hue), but it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li> I spent too much money on this product.  I was hoping it would perform really well since I paid so much.  It is good at disguising dark circles, but it settles in the fine lines and looks worse than the products I was using before.  I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product arrived as promised in secure packaging.  It works as described and I use it to counter dark circles or any discoloration or blemish.  You do not need to use much so this container will go a very long way.  I am quite happy with all of my purchases from Watts and would recommend trying them.  I&#x27;ve also purchased mineral powder and is quite nice as well.</li>
            <li> I have to disagree with others posts on this product.  I found it to be more dry than creamy, even when I use a primer underneath directly before applying.  I also found the yellow tint to be an odd color.  It would be better if it were creamier and went on easily as I use it under my eye area mostly and I had to tug on the delicate skin there more than I would like.  I purchased another product and discontinued use.</li>
