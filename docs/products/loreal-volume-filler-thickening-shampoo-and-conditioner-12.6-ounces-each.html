            <li>EXCELLENT PRODUCT, WOULD BUY AGAIN AND RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li>A great value too!</li>
            <li>I bought this set at CVS, and I have to say that I was very impressed</li>

            <li>Also, the price is very good!</li>
            <li>Also...the volume ampules work as a great temporary &amp;#34;plumper&amp;#34; and smell great too.</li>
            <li>However, I am happy that my hair appears thicker and shinier.</li>
            <li>HAPPY.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line for me is that L&#x27;Oreal products are generally great quality</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy with these whether they boost fullness or not.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels great.  </li>
            <li>you can probably use 1/2 or 1/3 of a tube per week stretching the product and still getting great results.  </li>
            <li>Love it!!  </li>
            <li>love it !!  </li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>

            <li>Look.. I use to think loreals shampoos and conditioners were amazing.</li>
            <li>and it has done AMAZING things for me.</li>
            <li>I have had compliments on how nice my hair looks.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to discover this Volume Filler shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It kind of smelled like salon (like the hair coloring products).</li>
            <li>I started eating healthy and exercising, and I lost 132 lbs, which is great, but it also caused more hair thinning.</li>
            <li>but L&#x27;Oreal really did a superb job this time.</li>
            <li>my hair had a nice sheen.  </li>
            <li>Amazing conditioner and for a great price does exactly what it says!</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thinning hair and was hopeful that this would help.  </li>
            <li>I switched to OGX and have tried a variety of their products that moisturize and smooth with great success.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Bought two more for my daughters.</li>
            <li>like I had 2X more hair</li>
            <li>AND it wasn&#x27;t my favorite smelling shampoo.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>100% Satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>The more I use it the thicker my hair looks.  </li>
            <li>I find the gray in my hair more manigble..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many thickening shampoos and serums and they did not work at all.  </li>
            <li>I love all the Advanced Care products!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any difference in the thickness or a better feel to my hair.</li>
            <li>&amp; I love it.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t get a much better testimonial than that</li>
            <li>how well I love this line of products.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I love it :)</li>
            <li>Happy with it and highly recommend</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say anything good about this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just not to my taste and too strong to ignore.</li>
            <li>Not thinning....but extremely fine.</li>
            <li>Seems to add body to my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I am 63 with fine, thinning hair</li>
            <li>I have fine curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>I have fine hair &amp; seemed to be thinning at the crown.  </li>
            <li>I do not have fine hair.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is light and not offensive.</li>
            <li>I will keep using this until the next great thing comes out.</li>
            <li>I once had a sneezing fit while applying it in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Please make this product available in Canada.</li>
            <li>I have never been so happy to find products that actually do what they advertise.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t style, my hair smelled fantastic.</li>
            <li>I looked on Amazon before buying this at a brick and mortar store and didn&#x27;t find a review that fit my situation.</li>
            <li>Overall I really liked this shampoo/conditioner, it smelled nice and didn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like I need anything more right now</li>
            <li>What I did not like, particularly, was that my hair didn&#x27;t seem as shiny as I would have liked.  </li>
            <li>This is my new favorite!</li>
            <li>I have straight, very fine hair</li>
            <li>I like the smell and my hair looks clean and shiny after using these products</li>
            <li>The shampoo leaves the hair clean and with the conditioner</li>
            <li>the young vivacious model is sure to have lovely hair at her age...</li>
            <li>It definitely wasn&#x27;t a pleasant aroma and</li>
            <li>one night t get it to feel clean and full.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t hurt to try it, right !</li>
            <li>And I even gave it a full week to see if it would change with time.</li>
            <li>Body shampoo, condition, and mousse make my hair look full and</li>
            <li>I have always had an oily scalp and have had to wash my hair every morning and use a lot of sprays and gels to get a full look.</li>
            <li>It is not all gonebut you can see the scalp if the light is right.  </li>
            <li>It would have been better if they has marketed it as giving you hair that is silky &amp; soft, as that would be accurate.</li>
            <li>Nice lather as well, and did not dry out my hair like others have.</li>
            <li>I have several L&#x27;Oreal products that I love, but I&#x27;ll never touch this shampoo or conditioner again!</li>
            <li>This shampoo actually works to give me more volume!</li>
            <li>I started using this because my hair is fine and straight in the winter and could use a boost.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, the thing is kind of as expected and its better than the dove</li>
            <li>It may not be for everyone, but I&#x27;d say it is worth the try.</li>
            <li>I loved their other product.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right..</li>
            <li>My hair actually feels dramatically thicker and more full.</li>
            <li>This L&#x27;Oreal line leaves my hair feeling clean for up to three days and has really cut a lot of time out of my hair grooming</li>
            <li>This line did the trick from the first use and after a few more uses it got even better.  </li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t have very much hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine, naturally curly/wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>My hairdresser, who&#x27;s been doing my hair for decades, has been even making comments about how much hair even feels thicker to the touch!</li>
            <li>For me, this product does not make my hair big, but makes it so much more manageable.</li>
            <li>Definitely gonna keep using it! :)</li>
            <li>I found that this shampoo and conditioner did, indeed, make my hair look fuller than it has in the past and the scent of both the shampoo and conditioner was pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Great for fine and thin hair!</li>
            <li>bought the whole line in one last ditch effort to have better hair.  </li>
            <li>The only redeeming quality is the nice scent, however that is even a little overpowering.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner smelled nice and cleaned gently, but even when used with the other parts of the system I felt no difference.</li>
            <li>These products leave my hair easy to detangle but not flat.</li>
            <li>My only positive point to make is that it has a pleasant smell akin to and expected of the L&#x27;Oreal brand.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t an amazing transformation but my hair is less &amp;#34;fly away&amp;#34; and looks very shiney.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need much to get up a lather.</li>
            <li>For me, if it does work well, it will be a real blessing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 1</li>
            <li>I think they really do help.</li>
            <li>I was ready to get a wig when I found this shampoo.</li>
            <li>and I really like the way it hadles now.</li>
            <li>and yes, I absolutely feel that I have twice the hair.  </li>
            <li>no body, stick straight, unstyleable.  </li>
            <li>I admit I haven&#x27;t tried a lot of products, but this system has worked very well for me.</li>
            <li>this listing makes it sound like you are getting 4 bottles, but it is only one set.</li>
            <li>You can find much cheaper at walmart and target.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t read the whole blurb about this and when they arrived I see it is one shampoo and one conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a skeptic, but I really like this.</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t do much of anything for my hair.</li>
            <li>but I think I might be ready to admit that I already have it.</li>
            <li>does absolutely nothing..</li>
            <li>It has really thickened my hair &amp; I don&#x27;t have the problem with the crown.  </li>
            <li>If you have gray hair that you color, keeping the roots colored does make this line perform that much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I feel absolutely bamboozled.</li>
            <li>Thanks to L&#x27;Oreal, everyone around me knew I had washed my hair.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s now taking up valuable real estate in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>Memo to my guests, please use as much as you like.  </li>
            <li>With my hair longer, I began using the whole system (including the ampules and gelee) and stuck with it for ​​about two months before giving up.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>The first thing a purchaser should be aware of is that the \\&quot;Loreal Volume Filler Densifying Gelee,\\&quot; the \\&quot;Loreal Volume Filler Thickening Ampoulles,\\&quot; and the \\&quot;L&#x27;Oreal Volume Filler Thickening Shampoo and Conditioner,\\&quot; are a complete system.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think the product does a pretty good job of creating the illusion of thicker hair for thin, fine hair like</li>
            <li>This product does give me more volume and a thicker appearance than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>hair has always been baby fine, used to be somewhat thick, but I started losing hair on top when I was about 40 years old.  </li>
            <li>When I just washed it with this shampoo &amp; conditioner, there were no knots, just smooth long hair.    </li>
            <li>Unlike most of these products this shampoo and conditioner isn&#x27;t weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner and recommend it to anyone with thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li>I am an older woman (62) with somewhat thinning hair.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, straight hair, but a lot of it, and it holds absolutely no volume without massive amounts of product.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend the shampoo.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Hair chemist coconut oil shampoo, conditioner, and masque.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair and am always looking for something to fluff it up.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping for a little bit more volume than I got, but I will see what happens as I continue to use the products as recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 2 &amp; 3</li>
            <li>Makes my long layered thin hair seem fuller and bouncier, nice clean smell!  </li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s hair is different, but this worked for me, and it&#x27;s worth a shot</li>
            <li>Hair is always falling in my face, even after styling, and my hair feels more limp than before using the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I have kept my hair short for all my adult life because it just doesn&#x27;t look good long, but now I can actually grow out my hair.  </li>
            <li>just by letting it air dry, and the difference was amazing.......and, in the shower, I could already see the difference of how smooth,  silky, and soft my hair had already felt.......</li>
            <li>If you have fine, thin hair...you NEED this shampoo! :)</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty thick to begin with, and after the first wash it literally looks even thicker and full.</li>
            <li>As a hair stylist , I&#x27;m always trying new products, from salon brands to drugstore brands.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I tend to try all new volumizing products in search of The One</li>
            <li>It does look and feel thicker, with smooth texture and feels very lifted and fluffy.</li>
            <li>I would wake up at night &amp; feel the back of my hair, no tangles, big knots or puffy places where huge knots were hiding.</li>
            <li>I have pretty long, straight, hair.....</li>
            <li>kinda flat, dull, tangles easily, but after just the first time using this, my hair had so much more volume, and I didn&#x27;t even blow dry it.......</li>
            <li>I have very thin, fine hair, so I will be able to tell if the product is working or not.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive  to fragrance</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first I&#x27;ve found in years that I actually notice a difference.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I wish it could either be a more neutral fragrance or at least less strong.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the FIRST shampoo/conditioner that makes my hair look and feel bigger, but also leaves it soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I have very long highlighted hair that can get weighed down very easily.</li>
            <li>: I intended to do this sooner, but as we all do, I got busy.</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t see that my hair looks any fuller than it did with my regular Kirkland shampoo and conditioners.</li>
            <li>But hey, if you like loud fruity/floral fragrances, you&#x27;ll like the smell of this.  </li>
            <li>-- I don&#x27;t have a lot of it and have always felt self conscious about it.</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this product!</li>
            <li>Maybe it depends how soft the water is???</li>
            <li>Not only makes my hair feel thicker, but it really is thicker.  </li>
            <li>The only product that really does what it promises.  </li>
            <li>I ordered it because I wanted something that would make a considerable difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li>But so far it has worked for me</li>
            <li>As far as claims of adding volume to fine/thin hair over time, don&#x27;t hold your breath.</li>
            <li>Now, as far as a cleansing shampoo goes, yes, that it does.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had very fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>I saw the commercial with Blake lively and bought the shampoo, conditioner, and gel.</li>
            <li>My thin, fine, chin length hair doesn&#x27;t look any thicker/fuller than normal.</li>
            <li>At my age to have thicker, fuller hair the very first washing and moisturizing is just a plain miracle.</li>
            <li>If you have very knotty hair, long or short, give it a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried the shampoo so far.</li>
            <li>the humidity in the air brought back my natural wave and curl.  </li>
            <li>That was about $18 worth of products which turned out to be a waste.</li>
            <li>I am in my mid thirties and my hair has always been very fine and thin</li>
            <li>So while it doesn&#x27;t seem to me that these made my hair feel any thicker, it certainly looks fuller whether it&#x27;s due to the season or to the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been having a hard time finding a really good shampoo/conditioner for my hair that doesn&#x27;t cost a bundle lately.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is great for volume but the conditioner still made my hair limp unfortunately.  </li>
            <li>I have super straight, thin, Asian hair that NEVER gets any volume.</li>
            <li>Over the past month of use, I have not seen any noticeable difference in the volume of my hair, but thankfully it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling oily and weighed down halfway through the day like most shampoos.</li>
            <li>My hair felt like it was stripped of every bit of health and then coated in a brittle varnish, which left it looking thinner than ever with major fly-away issues.  </li>
            <li>My hair is now full and thick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s straight and just lays down against my head.</li>
            <li>I have thin barely there hair because of health reasons and this easy shampoo and conditioner was the only products I used on my hair</li>
            <li>Other than leave my hair a silky smooth flat non-thickened/non-volumized mess</li>
            <li>Once my hair grows much below my shoulders, the ends look pretty thin and scraggly.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and full of volume....perfect for thin hair.</li>
            <li>Made my baby fine, thin hair even finer and thinner feeling and looking.  </li>

            <li> BEST SHAMPOO</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT, WOULD BUY AGAIN AND RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> A great value too!</li>
            <li> I bought this set at CVS, and I have to say that I was very impressed</li>
            <li> Nothing is perfect.</li>
            <li> the best it&#x27;s ever looked.</li>
            <li> Great value for the money!</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful !!</li>
            <li> This one seems to work best.  </li>
            <li> Also, the price is very good!</li>
            <li> Also...the volume ampules work as a great temporary &amp;#34;plumper&amp;#34; and smell great too.</li>
            <li> However, I am happy that my hair appears thicker and shinier.</li>
            <li> HAPPY.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line for me is that L&#x27;Oreal products are generally great quality</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy with these whether they boost fullness or not.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels great.  </li>
            <li> you can probably use 1/2 or 1/3 of a tube per week stretching the product and still getting great results.  </li>
            <li> Love it!!  </li>
            <li> love it !!  </li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> The fragrance is wonderful and my hair is shiny, smooth and bouncy!</li>
            <li> What a pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li> Good Quality.</li>
            <li> bought this after using Loreal&#x27;s Color Vibrancy Shampoo/Conditioner and loved it.</li>
            <li> Good value for the price to.</li>
            <li> This is my FAVORITE shampoo!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!  </li>
            <li> Look.. I use to think loreals shampoos and conditioners were amazing.</li>
            <li> and it has done AMAZING things for me.</li>
            <li> I have had compliments on how nice my hair looks.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to discover this Volume Filler shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It kind of smelled like salon (like the hair coloring products).</li>
            <li> I started eating healthy and exercising, and I lost 132 lbs, which is great, but it also caused more hair thinning.</li>
            <li> but L&#x27;Oreal really did a superb job this time.</li>
            <li> my hair had a nice sheen.  </li>
            <li> Amazing conditioner and for a great price does exactly what it says!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thinning hair and was hopeful that this would help.  </li>
            <li> I switched to OGX and have tried a variety of their products that moisturize and smooth with great success.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> Bought two more for my daughters.</li>
            <li> like I had 2X more hair</li>
            <li> AND it wasn&#x27;t my favorite smelling shampoo.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> 100% Satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> The more I use it the thicker my hair looks.  </li>
            <li> I find the gray in my hair more manigble..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many thickening shampoos and serums and they did not work at all.  </li>
            <li> I love all the Advanced Care products!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference in the thickness or a better feel to my hair.</li>
            <li> &amp; I love it.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get a much better testimonial than that</li>
            <li> how well I love this line of products.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and I love it :)</li>
            <li> Happy with it and highly recommend</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say anything good about this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not to my taste and too strong to ignore.</li>
            <li> Not thinning....but extremely fine.</li>
            <li> Seems to add body to my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I am 63 with fine, thinning hair</li>
            <li> I have fine curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair</li>
            <li> I have fine hair &amp; seemed to be thinning at the crown.  </li>
            <li> I do not have fine hair.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is light and not offensive.</li>
            <li> I will keep using this until the next great thing comes out.</li>
            <li> I once had a sneezing fit while applying it in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Please make this product available in Canada.</li>
            <li> I have never been so happy to find products that actually do what they advertise.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t style, my hair smelled fantastic.</li>
            <li> I looked on Amazon before buying this at a brick and mortar store and didn&#x27;t find a review that fit my situation.</li>
            <li> Overall I really liked this shampoo/conditioner, it smelled nice and didn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I need anything more right now</li>
            <li> What I did not like, particularly, was that my hair didn&#x27;t seem as shiny as I would have liked.  </li>
            <li> This is my new favorite!</li>
            <li> I have straight, very fine hair</li>
            <li> I like the smell and my hair looks clean and shiny after using these products</li>
            <li> The shampoo leaves the hair clean and with the conditioner</li>
            <li> the young vivacious model is sure to have lovely hair at her age...</li>
            <li> It definitely wasn&#x27;t a pleasant aroma and</li>
            <li> one night t get it to feel clean and full.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t hurt to try it, right !</li>
            <li> And I even gave it a full week to see if it would change with time.</li>
            <li> Body shampoo, condition, and mousse make my hair look full and</li>
            <li> I have always had an oily scalp and have had to wash my hair every morning and use a lot of sprays and gels to get a full look.</li>
            <li> It is not all gonebut you can see the scalp if the light is right.  </li>
            <li> It would have been better if they has marketed it as giving you hair that is silky &amp; soft, as that would be accurate.</li>
            <li> Nice lather as well, and did not dry out my hair like others have.</li>
            <li> I have several L&#x27;Oreal products that I love, but I&#x27;ll never touch this shampoo or conditioner again!</li>
            <li> This shampoo actually works to give me more volume!</li>
            <li> I started using this because my hair is fine and straight in the winter and could use a boost.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, the thing is kind of as expected and its better than the dove</li>
            <li> It may not be for everyone, but I&#x27;d say it is worth the try.</li>
            <li> I loved their other product.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right..</li>
            <li> My hair actually feels dramatically thicker and more full.</li>
            <li> This L&#x27;Oreal line leaves my hair feeling clean for up to three days and has really cut a lot of time out of my hair grooming</li>
            <li> This line did the trick from the first use and after a few more uses it got even better.  </li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t have very much hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine, naturally curly/wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser, who&#x27;s been doing my hair for decades, has been even making comments about how much hair even feels thicker to the touch!</li>
            <li> For me, this product does not make my hair big, but makes it so much more manageable.</li>
            <li> Definitely gonna keep using it! :)</li>
            <li> I found that this shampoo and conditioner did, indeed, make my hair look fuller than it has in the past and the scent of both the shampoo and conditioner was pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Great for fine and thin hair!</li>
            <li> bought the whole line in one last ditch effort to have better hair.  </li>
            <li> The only redeeming quality is the nice scent, however that is even a little overpowering.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner smelled nice and cleaned gently, but even when used with the other parts of the system I felt no difference.</li>
            <li> These products leave my hair easy to detangle but not flat.</li>
            <li> My only positive point to make is that it has a pleasant smell akin to and expected of the L&#x27;Oreal brand.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t an amazing transformation but my hair is less &amp;#34;fly away&amp;#34; and looks very shiney.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need much to get up a lather.</li>
            <li> For me, if it does work well, it will be a real blessing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 1</li>
            <li> I think they really do help.</li>
            <li> I was ready to get a wig when I found this shampoo.</li>
            <li> and I really like the way it hadles now.</li>
            <li> and yes, I absolutely feel that I have twice the hair.  </li>
            <li> no body, stick straight, unstyleable.  </li>
            <li> I admit I haven&#x27;t tried a lot of products, but this system has worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> this listing makes it sound like you are getting 4 bottles, but it is only one set.</li>
            <li> You can find much cheaper at walmart and target.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t read the whole blurb about this and when they arrived I see it is one shampoo and one conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a skeptic, but I really like this.</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t do much of anything for my hair.</li>
            <li> but I think I might be ready to admit that I already have it.</li>
            <li> does absolutely nothing..</li>
            <li> It has really thickened my hair &amp; I don&#x27;t have the problem with the crown.  </li>
            <li> If you have gray hair that you color, keeping the roots colored does make this line perform that much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I feel absolutely bamboozled.</li>
            <li> Thanks to L&#x27;Oreal, everyone around me knew I had washed my hair.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s now taking up valuable real estate in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> Memo to my guests, please use as much as you like.  </li>
            <li> With my hair longer, I began using the whole system (including the ampules and gelee) and stuck with it for ​​about two months before giving up.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> The first thing a purchaser should be aware of is that the \\&quot;Loreal Volume Filler Densifying Gelee,\\&quot; the \\&quot;Loreal Volume Filler Thickening Ampoulles,\\&quot; and the \\&quot;L&#x27;Oreal Volume Filler Thickening Shampoo and Conditioner,\\&quot; are a complete system.</li>
            <li> Overall, I think the product does a pretty good job of creating the illusion of thicker hair for thin, fine hair like</li>
            <li> This product does give me more volume and a thicker appearance than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> hair has always been baby fine, used to be somewhat thick, but I started losing hair on top when I was about 40 years old.  </li>
            <li> When I just washed it with this shampoo &amp; conditioner, there were no knots, just smooth long hair.    </li>
            <li> Unlike most of these products this shampoo and conditioner isn&#x27;t weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner and recommend it to anyone with thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li> I am an older woman (62) with somewhat thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, straight hair, but a lot of it, and it holds absolutely no volume without massive amounts of product.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Hair chemist coconut oil shampoo, conditioner, and masque.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair and am always looking for something to fluff it up.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping for a little bit more volume than I got, but I will see what happens as I continue to use the products as recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 2 &amp; 3</li>
            <li> Makes my long layered thin hair seem fuller and bouncier, nice clean smell!  </li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s hair is different, but this worked for me, and it&#x27;s worth a shot</li>
            <li> Hair is always falling in my face, even after styling, and my hair feels more limp than before using the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I have kept my hair short for all my adult life because it just doesn&#x27;t look good long, but now I can actually grow out my hair.  </li>
            <li> just by letting it air dry, and the difference was amazing.......and, in the shower, I could already see the difference of how smooth,  silky, and soft my hair had already felt.......</li>
            <li> If you have fine, thin hair...you NEED this shampoo! :)</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty thick to begin with, and after the first wash it literally looks even thicker and full.</li>
            <li> As a hair stylist , I&#x27;m always trying new products, from salon brands to drugstore brands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I tend to try all new volumizing products in search of The One</li>
            <li> It does look and feel thicker, with smooth texture and feels very lifted and fluffy.</li>
            <li> I would wake up at night &amp; feel the back of my hair, no tangles, big knots or puffy places where huge knots were hiding.</li>
            <li> I have pretty long, straight, hair.....</li>
            <li> kinda flat, dull, tangles easily, but after just the first time using this, my hair had so much more volume, and I didn&#x27;t even blow dry it.......</li>
            <li> I have very thin, fine hair, so I will be able to tell if the product is working or not.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive  to fragrance</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first I&#x27;ve found in years that I actually notice a difference.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I wish it could either be a more neutral fragrance or at least less strong.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the FIRST shampoo/conditioner that makes my hair look and feel bigger, but also leaves it soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I have very long highlighted hair that can get weighed down very easily.</li>
            <li> : I intended to do this sooner, but as we all do, I got busy.</li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t see that my hair looks any fuller than it did with my regular Kirkland shampoo and conditioners.</li>
            <li> But hey, if you like loud fruity/floral fragrances, you&#x27;ll like the smell of this.  </li>
            <li> -- I don&#x27;t have a lot of it and have always felt self conscious about it.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product!</li>
            <li> Maybe it depends how soft the water is???</li>
            <li> Not only makes my hair feel thicker, but it really is thicker.  </li>
            <li> The only product that really does what it promises.  </li>
            <li> I ordered it because I wanted something that would make a considerable difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li> But so far it has worked for me</li>
            <li> As far as claims of adding volume to fine/thin hair over time, don&#x27;t hold your breath.</li>
            <li> Now, as far as a cleansing shampoo goes, yes, that it does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had very fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> I saw the commercial with Blake lively and bought the shampoo, conditioner, and gel.</li>
            <li> My thin, fine, chin length hair doesn&#x27;t look any thicker/fuller than normal.</li>
            <li> At my age to have thicker, fuller hair the very first washing and moisturizing is just a plain miracle.</li>
            <li> If you have very knotty hair, long or short, give it a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried the shampoo so far.</li>
            <li> the humidity in the air brought back my natural wave and curl.  </li>
            <li> That was about $18 worth of products which turned out to be a waste.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid thirties and my hair has always been very fine and thin</li>
            <li> So while it doesn&#x27;t seem to me that these made my hair feel any thicker, it certainly looks fuller whether it&#x27;s due to the season or to the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been having a hard time finding a really good shampoo/conditioner for my hair that doesn&#x27;t cost a bundle lately.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is great for volume but the conditioner still made my hair limp unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> I have super straight, thin, Asian hair that NEVER gets any volume.</li>
            <li> Over the past month of use, I have not seen any noticeable difference in the volume of my hair, but thankfully it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling oily and weighed down halfway through the day like most shampoos.</li>
            <li> My hair felt like it was stripped of every bit of health and then coated in a brittle varnish, which left it looking thinner than ever with major fly-away issues.  </li>
            <li> My hair is now full and thick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s straight and just lays down against my head.</li>
            <li> I have thin barely there hair because of health reasons and this easy shampoo and conditioner was the only products I used on my hair</li>
            <li> Other than leave my hair a silky smooth flat non-thickened/non-volumized mess</li>
            <li> Once my hair grows much below my shoulders, the ends look pretty thin and scraggly.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and full of volume....perfect for thin hair.</li>
            <li> Made my baby fine, thin hair even finer and thinner feeling and looking.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the fragrance, which is a standard aggressive fruit punch odor that is so &amp;#34;in&amp;#34; right now in perfumery.  </li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing for my flat, limp hair - nothing.</li>
            <li> I have used other loreal shampoos and conditioners that have worked with the other parts like total repair and ultimate straight.</li>
            <li> At the end of the week, I would have unbelievable knots, when I took out my hair clip, the hair stood out almost straight back, with all sorts of knotty puffs, etc.</li>
            <li> I have very long, thin, stick straight hair that has a tendency to go limp pretty fast if I don&#x27;t have product in it when it&#x27;s down.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair stringy, totally flat,</li>
            <li> No body, no bounce, flat flat flat.  </li>
            <li> Others have left my hair dry, or flat.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was born with super thin hair.</li>
            <li> I, however, bought this whole line at a brick and mortar store that we all love to hate and</li>
            <li> My stylist said that&#x27;s a common problem with these kinds of products (and I already have pretty dry hair to begin with).</li>
            <li> Ended up dirty and flat most of the time.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of time and money...</li>
            <li> Once I stopped and went back to my old shampoo and conditioner, my hair is slowly growing back.  </li>
            <li> It was no different than any other shampoo.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it would dry it out significantly and leave it straw like.</li>
            <li> This does not weigh down thin, fine hair like every other product on the market.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any incidences of dry or itchy scalp in my life and</li>
            <li> Loreal let my hair so dry and</li>
            <li> and my hair was dry</li>
            <li> I tried so many very expensive brands</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling much less manageable.  </li>
            <li> I also bought the blow dry gel which actually weighs it down!</li>
            <li> , I would&#x27;ve told you I&#x27;d never bother to do over a shampoo); however, each time I&#x27;ve tried I&#x27;ve gotten a pre-recorded message stating that their office is closed.  </li>
            <li> The texture definitely felt smoother, and once I blow dried it I was SO.</li>
            <li> Left me hair with no body whatsoever, heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> Be really careful - look for thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> Other than some fragile and puffy volume, it just dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> Not good for fine, thin hair even though that&#x27;s what it is advertised for.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product after reading the other reviews.</li>
            <li> The other system I tried was over $50 for a month supply, and this may end up being $10 for 2 months supply.</li>
            <li> all other products claim to do.  </li>
            <li> I have only used this a few days, BUT it seems to make my hair a lot fuller!</li>
            <li> I didnt realize it until I statred using the other stuff.</li>
            <li> But, by using so much product, my hair would feel dirty the following morning.  </li>
            <li> Most of the very expensive volume shampoo, conditioner, and treatments, helped a little, but they seemed to work by drying out my hair and making it frizzy, so it looked bigger but also worse because it was so dry.</li>
            <li> one product that I have found helpful is the aussie spray gel, but it is hard for me to find locally.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m not paid to say this or anything, but I have only used these ONE TIME</li>
            <li> My individual strands are plenty thick.</li>
            <li> I think the conditioner weighs my hair down a bit, as it looks a bit flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I needed something, anything that did NOT weigh my hair down and that gave it some support and lift.  </li>
            <li> I felt like I had less hair.  </li>
            <li> I have really long thick semi-curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried hundreds of shampoos &amp; conditioners, but this works wonders for my long, thick, semi-curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using both for a few months</li>
            <li> I find it extremely hard to believe that other reviewers are stating it does.</li>
            <li> Since I only searched for shampoo and the bottles look so similar it is my bad.</li>
            <li> These are perhaps the worst shampoo and conditioner I have ever used; plus, they did exactly the opposite of what L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s claims are.  </li>
            <li> I usually wear it up as I&#x27;m at work or at the gym.</li>
            <li> My hair will stay fluffy at least three days, which, without using these products, I would have to spend a lot of time washing and restyling my hair after sleeping</li>
            <li> Having used L&#x27;Oreal products in the past, they seemed to deliver what they promised ( at least to some extent).</li>
            <li> My hair did not tangle hardly at all.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner made my hair extremely dull and lifeless.</li>
            <li> I was so unhappy that I actually attempted to contact L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s customer service line to complain (which had you asked me before this</li>
            <li> I found the 2-3+ minute wait before rinsing tedious and unnecessary, especially when results never materialized.</li>
            <li> I guess thick hair just isn&#x27;t in the cards for me.</li>
            <li> The conditioner seems counter productive to me .....will make your hair too soft/ limp !!</li>
            <li> Sorry L&#x27;Oreal, you let me down  with this one.</li>
            <li> hair feels drier, and is generally harder to manage during the day sticking out at weird angles (a problem I have not had before).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this, sadly.</li>
            <li> I am a tough customer to please</li>
            <li> This was by far the worst of them all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey for drug-store shampoo and conditioner, but it&#x27;s nowhere close to what I used to pay for high-end crap that didn&#x27;t work half as well.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, my hair is a train-wreck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> To the point that I went to the doctor thinking there was something seriously physically wrong with me.  </li>
            <li> For those of you who it didn&#x27;t work for I&#x27;m sorry to hear that.</li>
            <li> I wanted to cut it, it drove me crazy.</li>
            <li> I have a friend who was sitting behind me &amp; she said if it could make her hair look like mine, she would buy a gallon!!  </li>
            <li> For the price and size of the bottle, it&#x27;s not too bad, but if you&#x27;re looking for quality volumizing shampoo &amp; conditioner, you need to keep searching.</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this  product.</li>
            <li> But the worst part is the drying and itching!</li>
            <li> and it was just horrible.</li>

            <li> I have very fine hair. Not thinning....but extremely fine. This shampoo seems to help with that &amp;#34;blown up&amp;#34; cuticle effect that helps make your hair feel and look thicker. As a hair stylist , I&#x27;m always trying new products, from salon brands to drugstore brands. The conditioner seems counter productive to me .....will make your hair too soft/ limp !! Everybody should know that. Also...the volume ampules work as a great temporary &amp;#34;plumper&amp;#34; and smell great too.</li>
            <li> BEST SHAMPOO I EVER USED</li>
            <li> These are perhaps the worst shampoo and conditioner I have ever used; plus, they did exactly the opposite of what L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s claims are.  My hair felt like it was stripped of every bit of health and then coated in a brittle varnish, which left it looking thinner than ever with major fly-away issues.  I was so unhappy that I actually attempted to contact L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s customer service line to complain (which had you asked me before this, I would&#x27;ve told you I&#x27;d never bother to do over a shampoo); however, each time I&#x27;ve tried I&#x27;ve gotten a pre-recorded message stating that their office is closed.  I have several L&#x27;Oreal products that I love, but I&#x27;ll never touch this shampoo or conditioner again!</li>
            <li> This is my FAVORITE shampoo! I&#x27;ve always had very fine, thin hair. It&#x27;s straight and just lays down against my head. This shampoo actually works to give me more volume! It&#x27;s the first I&#x27;ve found in years that I actually notice a difference. My hairdresser, who&#x27;s been doing my hair for decades, has been even making comments about how much hair even feels thicker to the touch! It&#x27;s GOT to be the shampoo! :)  If you have fine, thin hair...you NEED this shampoo! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering if the 5-star reviews were written by L&#x27;Oreal. It&#x27;s your basic shampoo. It would have been better if they has marketed it as giving you hair that is silky &amp; soft, as that would be accurate. My thin, fine, chin length hair doesn&#x27;t look any thicker/fuller than normal. I think the conditioner weighs my hair down a bit, as it looks a bit flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one product that I have found helpful is the aussie spray gel, but it is hard for me to find locally.</li>
            <li> I have super straight, thin, Asian hair that NEVER gets any volume. But this worked. I&#x27;ve only tried the shampoo so far. Now that I know that that works, I&#x27;ll probably pick up the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Seems to add body to my fine hair.  Don&#x27;t need much to get up a lather.</li>
            <li> The first thing a purchaser should be aware of is that the \\&quot;Loreal Volume Filler Densifying Gelee,\\&quot; the \\&quot;Loreal Volume Filler Thickening Ampoulles,\\&quot; and the \\&quot;L&#x27;Oreal Volume Filler Thickening Shampoo and Conditioner,\\&quot; are a complete system. I am going to repeat this review in each of my product reviews. I am going to test these over the three-week period that is recommended on the product label for the ampoulles and the shampoo. I have very thin, fine hair, so I will be able to tell if the product is working or not. For me, if it does work well, it will be a real blessing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 1: My hair seems marginally thicker. I was hoping for a little bit more volume than I got, but I will see what happens as I continue to use the products as recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 2 &amp; 3: I intended to do this sooner, but as we all do, I got busy. I maintain my 4 star review. My hair has the appearance of being thicker. I have had compliments on how nice my hair looks. I did not give 5 stars, because I don&#x27;t think my hair feels 2X thicker as the advertisement on TV states. However, I am happy that my hair appears thicker and shinier. Overall, I think the product does a pretty good job of creating the illusion of thicker hair for thin, fine hair like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on continuing to use the thickening ampules as a part of my hair care regimen. I think they really do help.</li>
            <li> MADE MY HAIR FALL OUT</li>
            <li> I was running out of my pricy salon shampoo and conditioner and needed something to use until my next appointment. I decided to try this product after reading the other reviews. This is my new favorite! I have very long highlighted hair that can get weighed down very easily. These products leave my hair easy to detangle but not flat. The fragrance is wonderful and my hair is shiny, smooth and bouncy!</li>
            <li> Thanks, the thing is kind of as expected and its better than the dove last time.&lt;br /&gt;But still, this one is out of foam seemingly.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT, WOULD BUY AGAIN AND RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> I was ready to get a wig when I found this shampoo. My hair is now full and thick. A great value too!</li>
            <li> I have very fine, straight hair, but a lot of it, and it holds absolutely no volume without massive amounts of product. I wanted to try this shampoo to replace my expensive salon-brand shampoo, but I&#x27;m only mildly satisfied. Over the past month of use, I have not seen any noticeable difference in the volume of my hair, but thankfully it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling oily and weighed down halfway through the day like most shampoos. For the price and size of the bottle, it&#x27;s not too bad, but if you&#x27;re looking for quality volumizing shampoo &amp; conditioner, you need to keep searching.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and my hair looks clean and shiny after using these products but I really don&#x27;t see that my hair looks any fuller than it did with my regular Kirkland shampoo and conditioners.</li>
            <li> I have been having a hard time finding a really good shampoo/conditioner for my hair that doesn&#x27;t cost a bundle lately. Finally I saw a commercial for this and decided to try it. I have very long, thin, stick straight hair that has a tendency to go limp pretty fast if I don&#x27;t have product in it when it&#x27;s down. I purchased this shampoo and conditioner, along with a thickening product of the same line that I haven&#x27;t tried yet. I could tell a difference in the shower! The texture definitely felt smoother, and once I blow dried it I was SO. HAPPY. It does look and feel thicker, with smooth texture and feels very lifted and fluffy. Ahhhhhh. Definitely a must buy...</li>
            <li> I bought this set at CVS, and I have to say that I was very impressed.......I have pretty long, straight, hair.....kinda flat, dull, tangles easily, but after just the first time using this, my hair had so much more volume, and I didn&#x27;t even blow dry it.......just by letting it air dry, and the difference was amazing.......and, in the shower, I could already see the difference of how smooth,  silky, and soft my hair had already felt.......this I&#x27;d definitely a must buy.....can&#x27;t hurt to try it, right !</li>
            <li> I have fine, naturally curly/wavy hair.  This product does give me more volume and a thicker appearance than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.  My only complaint is the fragrance, which is a standard aggressive fruit punch odor that is so &amp;#34;in&amp;#34; right now in perfumery.  I wish it could either be a more neutral fragrance or at least less strong.  But hey, if you like loud fruity/floral fragrances, you&#x27;ll like the smell of this.  It&#x27;s just not to my taste and too strong to ignore.</li>
            <li> Love it!!  Bought two more for my daughters.</li>
            <li> My hair looks a lot fuller and I really like the way it hadles now.</li>
            <li> Wow!  What a pleasant surprise.  This product pair actually does what it says it will do.  I am 63 with fine, thinning hair and I buy any volume product I can find.  I was thrilled to discover this Volume Filler shampoo and conditioner.  I have been using both for a few months and yes, I absolutely feel that I have twice the hair.  I have kept my hair short for all my adult life because it just doesn&#x27;t look good long, but now I can actually grow out my hair.  Thank you L&amp;#34;Oreal  !!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair. I have tried just about every product out there to make my hair seem thicker. Unlike most of these products this shampoo and conditioner isn&#x27;t weighing my hair down. I have been using it exclusively for  almost a month. It isn&#x27;t an amazing transformation but my hair is less &amp;#34;fly away&amp;#34; and looks very shiney.  The fragrance is light and not offensive. I am very sensitive  to fragrance and I don&#x27;t have a problem with  this product.  I will keep using this until the next great thing comes out.</li>
            <li> I have fine curly hair.  I have been using the shampoo, conditioner and the booster for about 3 weeks.  This product made my hair stringy, totally flat, no body, stick straight, unstyleable.  Oh yeah it was shiny, but instead of feeling like I had 2X more hair I felt like I had less hair.  No body, no bounce, flat flat flat.  I&#x27;m tossing it!</li>
            <li> I bought these products at Walgreen&#x27;s because they were $4.99 each on sale. I am in my mid thirties and my hair has always been very fine and thin -- I don&#x27;t have a lot of it and have always felt self conscious about it. I admit I haven&#x27;t tried a lot of products, but this system has worked very well for me. My hair actually feels dramatically thicker and more full. I can see that others have posted that it hasn&#x27;t worked for them at all. It may not be for everyone, but I&#x27;d say it is worth the try. If it doesn&#x27;t work for you, take it back to the store and get your money back. The other system I tried was over $50 for a month supply, and this may end up being $10 for 2 months supply. I haven&#x27;t used the ampules yet, but maybe I will. I don&#x27;t feel like I need anything more right now and I&#x27;ve been using the product for about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I started using this because my hair is fine and straight in the winter and could use a boost.  However, by the time I started to use it regularly it was turning spring and the humidity in the air brought back my natural wave and curl.  So while it doesn&#x27;t seem to me that these made my hair feel any thicker, it certainly looks fuller whether it&#x27;s due to the season or to the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line for me is that L&#x27;Oreal products are generally great quality and I&#x27;m happy with these whether they boost fullness or not.  I&#x27;m going to keep using them.  My hair feels great.  That&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
            <li> Thought I would try this after seeing ad in a fasvorite masgazine. Used 4 days  then wegnt back to my Avon volumizer shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> this listing makes it sound like you are getting 4 bottles, but it is only one set. You can find much cheaper at walmart and target.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference in thickness AND it wasn&#x27;t my favorite smelling shampoo. It kind of smelled like salon (like the hair coloring products). It definitely wasn&#x27;t a pleasant aroma and my husband even noticed. I ended up giving it to charity.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t read the whole blurb about this and when they arrived I see it is one shampoo and one conditioner. Since I only searched for shampoo and the bottles look so similar it is my bad.</li>
            <li> I bought both the shampoo and conditioner.  The shampoo is great for volume but the conditioner still made my hair limp unfortunately.  Would highly recommend the shampoo.</li>
            <li> not as volumizing as advertised--for my hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t review products, but I was in the shower this morning and thought I should do one for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was born with super thin hair. When I was 13, I was diagnosed with Hashimoto&#x27;s disease, which causes thinning hair. You could see my scalp in the sunlight, so I started coloring it darker, and that helped a bunch, but now my hair was damaged too. When I was 23 (3 years ago) I started eating healthy and exercising, and I lost 132 lbs, which is great, but it also caused more hair thinning. Needless to say, my hair is a train-wreck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried everything. EVERYTHING. Most of the very expensive volume shampoo, conditioner, and treatments, helped a little, but they seemed to work by drying out my hair and making it frizzy, so it looked bigger but also worse because it was so dry. I was always fighting between using volume products and moistening products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the FIRST shampoo/conditioner that makes my hair look and feel bigger, but also leaves it soft and silky. It&#x27;s pricey for drug-store shampoo and conditioner, but it&#x27;s nowhere close to what I used to pay for high-end crap that didn&#x27;t work half as well. I did not even buy the gel, but I plan to. I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo/conditioner about a week and I love it. Everyone&#x27;s hair is different, but this worked for me, and it&#x27;s worth a shot I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept telling myself &amp;#34;You can&#x27;t rate it five stars. Nothing is perfect. Rate it four and try and think of something you don&#x27;t like about it so you will seem impartial and people will take you seriously.&amp;#34; but I&#x27;ve sat here for about 7 min, and I can&#x27;t think of anything, so for now it&#x27;s 5 stars. I hope i feel the same way in 5 months or so, we will see. I&#x27;m a skeptic, but I really like this.</li>
            <li> After my second use my hair was already feeling/looking thicker.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product! It really didn&#x27;t do much of anything for my hair. I have straight, very fine hair that&#x27;s about 4-5&amp;#34; below my shoulders, and about medium thickness. I didn&#x27;t notice any increase in volume at all with this product. And I even gave it a full week to see if it would change with time. I also bought the blow dry gel which actually weighs it down! It did, however, leave my hair shiny and delicious-smelling...but that wasn&#x27;t the purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to try all new volumizing products in search of The One but I think I might be ready to admit that I already have it. Tresemme 24 Hour Body shampoo, condition, and mousse make my hair look full and the best it&#x27;s ever looked.</li>
            <li> I found that this shampoo and conditioner did, indeed, make my hair look fuller than it has in the past and the scent of both the shampoo and conditioner was pleasant.  What I did not like, particularly, was that my hair didn&#x27;t seem as shiny as I would have liked.  I will use both products again and see if I get the same result.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say anything good about this shampoo.  I have fine hair and I am always trying volumizing products.  This was by far the worst of them all.  It left my hair feeling much less manageable.  Hair is always falling in my face, even after styling, and my hair feels more limp than before using the shampoo.  The only redeeming quality is the nice scent, however that is even a little overpowering.  I once had a sneezing fit while applying it in the shower.  I will not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I am an older woman (62) with somewhat thinning hair. I was looking for a shampoo and conditioner that would thicken the hair and add volume. Gave this a shot for a month. Left me hair with no body whatsoever, heavy and greasy. Threw out what I had left.</li>
            <li> Amazing conditioner and for a great price does exactly what it says! I tried so many very expensive brands but L&#x27;Oreal really did a superb job this time. Happy with it and highly recommend</li>
            <li> does not make hair thicker....</li>
            <li> Great value for the money! The shampoo doesn&#x27;t work wonders but definitely adds volume.</li>
            <li> Good Quality. Visible Results. 100% Satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  The more I use it the thicker my hair looks.  The shampoo leaves the hair clean and with the conditioner my hair had a nice sheen.  I find the gray in my hair more manigble..</li>
            <li> Made my baby fine, thin hair even finer and thinner feeling and looking.  Maybe it depends how soft the water is???</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful !!</li>
            <li> Complete waste of time and money...the young vivacious model is sure to have lovely hair at her age...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but not all of us are her age..........does absolutely nothing..</li>
            <li> Be really careful - look for thinning hair.  This shampoo and conditioner made my hair fall out!  To the point that I went to the doctor thinking there was something seriously physically wrong with me.  Once I stopped and went back to my old shampoo and conditioner, my hair is slowly growing back.  But considering my hair is to my waist, it will take years for it to recover.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about two weeks, and I am throwing this away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this after using Loreal&#x27;s Color Vibrancy Shampoo/Conditioner and loved it. I moved on, wanting what this shampoo promised: volume, and thicker looking hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did nothing for my hair, but to make it bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels drier, and is generally harder to manage during the day sticking out at weird angles (a problem I have not had before).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this, sadly. I loved their other product.</li>
            <li> At my age to have thicker, fuller hair the very first washing and moisturizing is just a plain miracle. I love this shampoo and conditioner and recommend it to anyone with thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have really long thick semi-curly hair. I struggled for years with combing it out. I usually wear it up as I&#x27;m at work or at the gym. At the end of the week, I would have unbelievable knots, when I took out my hair clip, the hair stood out almost straight back, with all sorts of knotty puffs, etc. I couldn&#x27;t comb it out, had to shampoo, creme rinse, then apply massive amounts of silicone in order to comb it out which took up to an hour at a time.    I wanted to cut it, it drove me crazy. I got a sample of this L&#x27;oreal Volume Filler, &amp; it was a MIRACLE! My hair did not tangle hardly at all. I combed it out twice during the week with no silicone products. I would wake up at night &amp; feel the back of my hair, no tangles, big knots or puffy places where huge knots were hiding. When I just washed it with this shampoo &amp; conditioner, there were no knots, just smooth long hair.    For me, this product does not make my hair big, but makes it so much more manageable. I have tried hundreds of shampoos &amp; conditioners, but this works wonders for my long, thick, semi-curly hair. If you have very knotty hair, long or short, give it a try. Amazing!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like how this product cleaned my hair at all. Ended up dirty and flat most of the time. Not good for fine, thin hair even though that&#x27;s what it is advertised for.</li>
            <li> This one seems to work best.  Others have left my hair dry, or flat.  This one seems to be a keeper for now. Not only makes my hair feel thicker, but it really is thicker.  Good value for the price to. Nice lather as well, and did not dry out my hair like others have.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner made my hair extremely dull and lifeless. But the worst part is the drying and itching! I&#x27;ve never had any incidences of dry or itchy scalp in my life and this shampoo made me want to rip my scalp off in the days following use. Maybe it is just me, but I cannot recommend thiese products based on my experience!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many thickening shampoos and serums and they did not work at all.  I bought this as a last resort to try.  After using this, this shampoo and conditioner works!  The only product that really does what it promises.  I love it!  I have thin barely there hair because of health reasons and this easy shampoo and conditioner was the only products I used on my hair and it did everything all other products claim to do.  My hair has volume.  And all I had to do was use the shampoo and conditioner.  That&#x27;s it!  Thank you Loreal!  You always deliver!</li>
            <li> I saw the commercial with Blake lively and bought the shampoo, conditioner, and gel. That was about $18 worth of products which turned out to be a waste. The shampoo and conditioner smelled nice and cleaned gently, but even when used with the other parts of the system I felt no difference. :( I have used other loreal shampoos and conditioners that have worked with the other parts like total repair and ultimate straight. Guess I&#x27;m gonna have to throw $18 away. -.-</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this  product. Having used L&#x27;Oreal products in the past, they seemed to deliver what they promised ( at least to some extent). I have very fine, thinning hair and was hopeful that this would help.  It did not.  It was no different than any other shampoo. Sorry L&#x27;Oreal, you let me down  with this one.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!  Makes my long layered thin hair seem fuller and bouncier, nice clean smell!  I love all the Advanced Care products!</li>
            <li> I ordered it because I wanted something that would make a considerable difference in my hair.  I didn&#x27;t see any difference in the thickness or a better feel to my hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair &amp; seemed to be thinning at the crown.  I read about this in a magazine &amp; decided to try it.  Have been using it for about 3 months &amp; I love it.  It has really thickened my hair &amp; I don&#x27;t have the problem with the crown.  I have a friend who was sitting behind me &amp; she said if it could make her hair look like mine, she would buy a gallon!!  You can&#x27;t get a much better testimonial than that &amp; she isn&#x27;t the only one who has complimented me.</li>
            <li> I have only used this a few days, BUT it seems to make my hair a lot fuller! My hair is soft and full of volume....perfect for thin hair. Also, the price is very good! I have paid a LOT of money for products that don&#x27;t work this well. Definitely gonna keep using it! :)</li>
            <li> Overall I really liked this shampoo/conditioner, it smelled nice and didn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy but unfortunately it would dry it out significantly and leave it straw like.</li>
            <li> Great for fine and thin hair!</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair and am always looking for something to fluff it up.  It did absolutely nothing for my flat, limp hair - nothing.</li>
            <li> love it !!  Please make this product available in Canada.</li>
            <li> Look.. I use to think loreals shampoos and conditioners were amazing. But recently I got Hair Chemist coconut oil set and it has done AMAZING things for me. Loreal let my hair so dry and ew . I didnt realize it until I statred using the other stuff. I ran out of the coconut oil stuff one day and had to use this and my hair was dry and it was just horrible. I highly recommend the Hair chemist coconut oil shampoo, conditioner, and masque. You can get it at sallys beauty supply or even here!</li>
            <li> For those out here who are complaining that this product does not work for them you MUST use the Thickening Ampules once per week as instructed.  If your hair is shoulder length or shorter you can probably use 1/2 or 1/3 of a tube per week stretching the product and still getting great results.  Once per week you mix the Ampule contents with the conditioner and leave it on your hair for about three minutes. Also, use the Gelee for blow outs (I&#x27;ve also used this when I set my hair on curlers.)  This does not weigh down thin, fine hair like every other product on the market.  IF you use ALL of the products you will NOT be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the whole line in one last ditch effort to have better hair.  This line is so inexpensive that I couldn&#x27;t resist.  I, however, bought this whole line at a brick and mortar store that we all love to hate and I haven&#x27;t seen any prices anywhere to beat theirs.  There is the shampoo, conditioner, Thickening Ampules, and Gelee.  I have never been so happy to find products that actually do what they advertise.  I am a tough customer to please and I have never found a hair product line that works as well as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use the L&#x27;Oreal Boost It spray at the roots when I am styling my hair.  My hair will stay fluffy at least three days, which, without using these products, I would have to spend a lot of time washing and restyling my hair after sleeping one night t get it to feel clean and full.  This brings up a point.  I have always had an oily scalp and have had to wash my hair every morning and use a lot of sprays and gels to get a full look. But, by using so much product, my hair would feel dirty the following morning.  This L&#x27;Oreal line leaves my hair feeling clean for up to three days and has really cut a lot of time out of my hair grooming routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has always been baby fine, used to be somewhat thick, but I started losing hair on top when I was about 40 years old.  It is not all gonebut you can see the scalp if the light is right.  I needed something, anything that did NOT weigh my hair down and that gave it some support and lift.  This line did the trick from the first use and after a few more uses it got even better.  And, I have not yet had to use a stripping shampoo to get rid of build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip though.  If you have gray hair that you color, keeping the roots colored does make this line perform that much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just can&#x27;t say enough about how well I love this line of products.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my hair while using this product. Also, you can buy it at a lower cost in your local retailers. Not worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m not paid to say this or anything, but I have only used these ONE TIME and I love it. My hair is pretty thick to begin with, and after the first wash it literally looks even thicker and full. I love it. For those of you who it didn&#x27;t work for I&#x27;m sorry to hear that. But so far it has worked for me and I love it :)</li>
            <li> As far as claims of adding volume to fine/thin hair over time, don&#x27;t hold your breath. This shampoo &amp; conditioner system falls short of producing any thickening/volumizing results period. I&#x27;ve been using this product in hopes of the slightest result for 7 months and I feel absolutely bamboozled. I find it extremely hard to believe that other reviewers are stating it does. Calling BS on that one.  Step 1: Shampoo. Now, as far as a cleansing shampoo goes, yes, that it does. In fact, it cleans hair so well, it dries out your scalp to the point of creating that unsightly flaky stuff called dandruff. My only positive point to make is that it has a pleasant smell akin to and expected of the L&#x27;Oreal brand.  Step 2: Conditioner. I found the 2-3+ minute wait before rinsing tedious and unnecessary, especially when results never materialized. Other than leave my hair a silky smooth flat non-thickened/non-volumized mess I couldn&#x27;t style, my hair smelled fantastic. Thanks to L&#x27;Oreal, everyone around me knew I had washed my hair. That&#x27;s right.. I paid another $6 for further proof I wash my hair. After 2 months, I stopped using the conditioner altogether and it&#x27;s now taking up valuable real estate in my bathroom. Memo to my guests, please use as much as you like.  Step 3: Repeat. But with a different product that actually works.  1 star rating for lack of results to support L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s claim and deceptive advertising.</li>
            <li> I looked on Amazon before buying this at a brick and mortar store and didn&#x27;t find a review that fit my situation. Would this product work on my hair? I do not have fine hair. My individual strands are plenty thick. I just don&#x27;t have very much hair. Once my hair grows much below my shoulders, the ends look pretty thin and scraggly. With my hair longer, I began using the whole system (including the ampules and gelee) and stuck with it for ​​about two months before giving up. It didn&#x27;t really work. Other than some fragile and puffy volume, it just dried out my hair. My stylist said that&#x27;s a common problem with these kinds of products (and I already have pretty dry hair to begin with). I guess thick hair just isn&#x27;t in the cards for me. I switched to OGX and have tried a variety of their products that moisturize and smooth with great success.</li>
