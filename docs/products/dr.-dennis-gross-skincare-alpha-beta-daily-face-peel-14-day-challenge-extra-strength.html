            <li>I was hoping for the best.</li>
            <li>Excellent product!  </li>
            <li>Best skincare I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I was VERY happy with the results after 4 days of use.</li>
            <li>I found it best to use them in the morning and skip any retinol product while using as they can be drying!</li>
            <li>Very effective!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>This set is a great deal.</li>
            <li>Love them!!</li>
            <li>I just ordered more!!</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>This is a good starter box and a lot cheaper than Sephora&#x27;s price ($47).</li>
            <li>These added to an already good skincare regimen  boost the results of any serums or moisturizer treatments.</li>
            <li>Loved it.  </li>
            <li>Works great and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>my face felt so much better!</li>
            <li>A cosmetic chemist friend recommended them and now I have a bunch of friends who are also using and loving them.</li>
            <li>This has offered the best results BY FAR, and I&#x27;ve even seen dermatologists.</li>
            <li>I have been so pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I feel a lot more confident now and have even gone places without wearing my makeup.</li>
            <li>If your results have been like mine, you won&#x27;t regret it :)</li>
            <li>I deal with it because my skin looks awesome and its a short time</li>
            <li>but if they could just make the scent more tolerable, they&#x27;d have 5 stars from me.</li>
            <li>sure to do your neck as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>hope this helps!! :)</li>
            <li>Was ok in the beginning</li>
            <li>I always love these and would order again.</li>
            <li>, I love my skin again.</li>
            <li>These pads are great and really improve the look and feel of my skin.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>And while most strong products cause dryness, I swear this helps get rid of the flakes.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a blemish since I started using these pads and my skin looks bright, spots are fading fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products, but this one is the best.</li>
            <li>I think it was too strong for me .</li>
            <li>These pads are pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>Wow, these are amazing.</li>
            <li>I think the serum is really the key, as I used the pads before and liked them but the combined effect is amazing.</li>
            <li>Very easy and quick to use, and didn&#x27;t cause any reactions to my very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>the Dennis gross peel pads are the most fantastic part of my skincare regimen.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes my skin have a healthy glow, takes away redness, and even removed an old acne</li>
            <li>Oh, and be sure to use SPF in the morning, That pretty young new skin is more photosensitive.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It removed the dry, flakey top layer of skin and revealed softer, smoother, oilier (!?) skin.</li>
            <li>As an added bonus, it really exacerbated my sensitivity to irritants like wool and even to the mild cleansers I&#x27;ve always used.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live w/out it!!!</li>
            <li>Made my skin smooth and clear.</li>
            <li>I am in love with the Dr. Gross Alpha Beta pads.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back for more.</li>
            <li>Large pores.</li>
            <li>My skin is much clearer and smoother.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The serum that comes with this set....not as much.</li>
            <li>No deep wrinkles, some light crows feet.</li>
            <li>And i use them 3-4 times a week after a gentle washing.</li>
            <li>I ordered this to substitute for a full-on glycolic peel, as my favorite salon recently closed (RIP Spa Willamina).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li>It really gives my skin a glow.</li>
            <li>And remember, the younger  you start stuff like this, the greater the benefit when you get old.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>I like the product wish there was a little more serum with it.</li>
            <li>I have oily to normal skin, medium tone.</li>
            <li>I am only on the second day and have seen a huge improvement.</li>
            <li>; I finished the application and went directly to my laptop!</li>
            <li>I have tried SO MANY different products for my acne, scarring, and dark spots.</li>
            <li>The texture of my skin also improved a lot, and I see an overall improvement to the face, a certain glow.  </li>
            <li>Huge waste.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive and reactive oily acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>These completely change the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>Then the serum will really plump the skin back</li>
            <li>This made my skin look smoother and clearer, and while it didn&#x27;t get rid of them completely, did fade my hyperpigmented &amp;#34;spots&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Made my 50  year old skin glow.</li>
            <li>Since I have thin, fair sensitive skin, I only used the pads once per day, so this product lasted for 14 days.</li>
            <li>have been using daily without any visible results, just oilier than normal skin.</li>
            <li>It certainly hydrates and plumps but can exacerbate my occasional isolated white heads.</li>
            <li>I would only suggest the extra strength for people who have experience with peels, as it is much stronger.</li>
            <li>and I see major results using this product doing these steps:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>first time I did the 14 day challenge, I of course did it everyday...</li>
            <li>I really like this product as a chemical exfoliant but was a little much for everyday use on my skin.</li>

            <li> After the 14-day treatment, I only noticed a slight change in my dark spots, but I was amazed at seeing the lines around my eyes really diminished!!  </li>
            <li> Several months after using this, my skin still hadn&#x27;t bounced back from the dry, saggy, red wrinkliness Dr Dennis left me with.</li>
            <li> I manage to be both oily and then dry at the same time.</li>
            <li> But if  you are looking for radiance and to do some minor- medium resurfacing, then buy these.</li>
            <li> After 14 days I did not notice a single difference in pore size or lines?</li>
            <li> A bit expensive but absolutely worth the price</li>
            <li> I aged a decade.</li>
            <li> I have thin, easily red , sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Then i used them every other night.</li>
            <li> I am going to start doing this every other day or maybe less, depending on how my skin feels!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My pores are a lot less visible.</li>
            <li> So,only about half way through the application, I stuck my head in the bathroom and looked in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> You get get two uses out of one packet if you cut it in half.  </li>
            <li> They make an Extra Strength one too and I will use those once a week or after a tough day.</li>
            <li> A waste of time and a waste of money (for me).</li>
            <li> Was very skeptical when I first started using it.</li>
            <li> But after a few mornings of using this product my skin felt and looked hydrated.</li>
            <li> I am sad that it is so pricey, however, I purchased this off of the Dr. Dennis Gross website twice now</li>
            <li> A serious word of warning: this destroyed my face.</li>
            <li> Sadly this product was not beneficial for my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I have been so insecure about my acne and scarring that I wouldn&#x27;t leave the house without makeup.</li>
            <li> Made my skin horribly irritated and red.</li>
            <li> While the product is expensive (very expensive, ugh), I would recommend it to anyone wanting to improve their skin.</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> But I have to say they smell HORRIBLE.</li>
            <li> Very  disappointed!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was hoping for the best. Sadly this product was not beneficial for my skin at all. A waste of time and a waste of money (for me). Skin needs are as diverse as finger prints...what did not work for me may be a godsend for someone else. Buy FYI...I have oily to normal skin, medium tone. This product was a total bust! Huge waste.</li>
            <li> I have been so pleased with this product. I have tried SO MANY different products for my acne, scarring, and dark spots. This has offered the best results BY FAR, and I&#x27;ve even seen dermatologists. While the product is expensive (very expensive, ugh), I would recommend it to anyone wanting to improve their skin. I have been so insecure about my acne and scarring that I wouldn&#x27;t leave the house without makeup. I feel a lot more confident now and have even gone places without wearing my makeup. Big deal for me. I&#x27;m really happy with this product and will continue to use it. If you are considering this product but are unsure if it&#x27;s worth the money, I would recommend that you at least try this. If your results have been like mine, you won&#x27;t regret it :)</li>
            <li> Terrible. Made my skin horribly irritated and red. Wish I could return. Stopped after 3 days.</li>
            <li> Wow, these are amazing. A cosmetic chemist friend recommended them and now I have a bunch of friends who are also using and loving them. This is a good starter box and a lot cheaper than Sephora&#x27;s price ($47). I&#x27;ve peeled ten years off my skin with these. Absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> Definitely a product that delivers results. I haven&#x27;t had a blemish since I started using these pads and my skin looks bright, spots are fading fast. But I have to say they smell HORRIBLE. I deal with it because my skin looks awesome and its a short time but if they could just make the scent more tolerable, they&#x27;d have 5 stars from me.</li>
            <li> Works great and very easy to use. This product actually does what it says.</li>
            <li> These pads are pretty amazing. I would only suggest the extra strength for people who have experience with peels, as it is much stronger. I have extremely sensitive and reactive oily acne-prone skin. These pads instantly brighten and over time improve any residual marks left from acne. I am only on the second day and have seen a huge improvement. These added to an already good skincare regimen  boost the results of any serums or moisturizer treatments. Love them!!</li>
            <li> have been using daily without any visible results, just oilier than normal skin.</li>
            <li> Made my skin smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> I really like this product as a chemical exfoliant but was a little much for everyday use on my skin. I use every couple of days and can definitely tell a difference in texture when I apply my makeup. Overall I would buy it again!</li>
            <li> This product did not do anything it said it would do! After 14 days I did not notice a single difference in pore size or lines? Very  disappointed!</li>
            <li> the Dennis gross peel pads are the most fantastic part of my skincare regimen. Some people say put on a dab of lipstick to flip your day around, I think a glow from one of these peels is enough to brighten my mood. A bit expensive but absolutely worth the price</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and Amazon sellers always have the lowest prices.</li>
            <li> The title says it all!! WOW!!! I looooooove this product! I am sad that it is so pricey, however, I purchased this off of the Dr. Dennis Gross website twice now and I like that it includes the bottle of ferulic acid + retinal brightening serum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my skincare regimen and I see major results using this product doing these steps:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanse face (Dr Gross Cleanser, or whatever you have!)&lt;br /&gt;Steam (2-3 times a week with Dr Gross Steamer)&lt;br /&gt;Step 1 Alpha Beta Extra Strength ( wait 1-2 minutes to absorb)&lt;br /&gt;Step 2 Alpha Beta Extra Strength ( wait 1-2 minutes to absorb)&lt;br /&gt;Small amount of Ferulic + Retinol (wait 1-2 minutes to absorb)&lt;br /&gt;Moisturize!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I did the 14 day challenge, I of course did it everyday... Between uses (waiting for shipment), I could tell my skin was just falling apart dry,and visible pores, redness.... The day that I got these and applied.. ahhh!! my face felt so much better! I am going to start doing this every other day or maybe less, depending on how my skin feels!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some notes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people believe that your skin will actually peel using this and it does not!&lt;br /&gt;It does not feel harsh.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin have a healthy glow, takes away redness, and even removed an old acne scar!&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have a big scent to bother!&lt;br /&gt;These come in 2 packets with a square application pad, similar to a makeup removing cloth!&lt;br /&gt;Keep rubbing  ( i do circular motions) until there is nothing left on the pad ( this takes a couple of minutes!)&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to do your neck as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps!! :)</li>
            <li> Made a definite difference in the texture of my skin, and I use it twice a week!</li>
            <li> Was ok in the beginning but then it made me break out so I stopped using the product all together. I think it was too strong for me .</li>
            <li> Item arrived with the serum having leaked out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Very effective! My skin is much clearer and smoother.  I think the serum is really the key, as I used the pads before and liked them but the combined effect is amazing.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  After the 14-day treatment, I only noticed a slight change in my dark spots, but I was amazed at seeing the lines around my eyes really diminished!!  The pores on my nose were significantly smaller, and the blackheads all gone. The texture of my skin also improved a lot, and I see an overall improvement to the face, a certain glow.  Very easy and quick to use, and didn&#x27;t cause any reactions to my very sensitive skin.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I always love these and would order again. This set is a great deal.</li>
            <li> I am in love with the Dr. Gross Alpha Beta pads. The serum that comes with this set....not as much. I feel like it makes me break out a bit. It certainly hydrates and plumps but can exacerbate my occasional isolated white heads. The pads though...they are perfection. I am 34. I have thin, easily red , sensitive skin. I manage to be both oily and then dry at the same time. Yay! Also, i am prone to isolated hormonal white heads betweeen my brows, around my mouth and in the creases of my nose. Large pores. No deep wrinkles, some light crows feet. These completely change the texture of my skin., Along the I zone my skin is like velvet now. My pores are a lot less visible. Makeup and spf go on perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I started out by using JUST the pads for 5 days in a row without experiencing any redness or dryness. Then i took 2 nights off. Then i used them every other night. I have not used them in the summer, just the winter. And while most strong products cause dryness, I swear this helps get rid of the flakes. Then the serum will really plump the skin back up.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for an anti aging miracle this isnt it. But if  you are looking for radiance and to do some minor- medium resurfacing, then buy these. I pass them out to my girlfriends like tic tacs and have turned them all into converts. And remember, the younger  you start stuff like this, the greater the benefit when you get old. Oh, and be sure to use SPF in the morning, That pretty young new skin is more photosensitive.&lt;br /&gt;I now buy JUST the pads, no serum. And i use them 3-4 times a week after a gentle washing. They make an Extra Strength one too and I will use those once a week or after a tough day.</li>
            <li> This made my skin look smoother and clearer, and while it didn&#x27;t get rid of them completely, did fade my hyperpigmented &amp;#34;spots&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> @56, I love my skin again. Best skincare I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I like the product wish there was a little more serum with it.</li>
            <li> Loved it.  Made my 50  year old skin glow.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to substitute for a full-on glycolic peel, as my favorite salon recently closed (RIP Spa Willamina). I was VERY happy with the results after 4 days of use. It removed the dry, flakey top layer of skin and revealed softer, smoother, oilier (!?) skin. I didn&#x27;t use any moisturizer while using this product; I didn&#x27;t need to! Since I have thin, fair sensitive skin, I only used the pads once per day, so this product lasted for 14 days. I would advise that one be careful when using around the corners of the mouth and the sides of the nostrils as this skin tends to be thin on most people. Otherwise, I give this 5 stars and will def buy again!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample and decided to give it a try. I began applying it to my face and thought, I should have looked in the mirror before I started so I could see the before and after. So,only about half way through the application, I stuck my head in the bathroom and looked in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;My response was,&amp;#34;WHOA!&amp;#34; I finished the application and went directly to my laptop! I&#x27;m back for more. It&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live w/out it!!!</li>
            <li> These pads are great and really improve the look and feel of my skin.  I found it best to use them in the morning and skip any retinol product while using as they can be drying!</li>
            <li> My godsister recommended this to me, and I thank her every time I see her!  It really gives my skin a glow.</li>
            <li> Clears and brightens skin.  You get get two uses out of one packet if you cut it in half.  I&#x27;ve tried other products, but this one is the best.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Was very skeptical when I first started using it. But after a few mornings of using this product my skin felt and looked hydrated. Everything the product claims it will do, it does. I just ordered more!!</li>
            <li> A serious word of warning: this destroyed my face. Several months after using this, my skin still hadn&#x27;t bounced back from the dry, saggy, red wrinkliness Dr Dennis left me with. I aged a decade. As an added bonus, it really exacerbated my sensitivity to irritants like wool and even to the mild cleansers I&#x27;ve always used. Regret doesn&#x27;t begin to cover my feelings about this one.</li>
            <li> Thank you 5 - STARS!!</li>
            <li> My skin looks like I just had a facial at the spa</li>
