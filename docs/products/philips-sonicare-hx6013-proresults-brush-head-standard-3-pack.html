            <li>I love my Phillips toothbrush and the toothbrush heads!</li>
            <li>and I spend more money on my toothbrush then on school!     </li>
            <li>/&gt;Absolutely love them!</li>
            <li>Love my Sonicare brush and these replacement heads!</li>
            <li>First off, Sonicare makes the best toothbrushes around.</li>
            <li>After many years of purchasing those brushheads, I thought I&#x27;d died and gone to heaven when I saw the price for these brushheads!</li>
            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>I took a chance with these and am pleased!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I purchased the sonicare electric brush, I love it!</li>
            <li>Now I am sure to replace them every three months!</li>
            <li>Guess I should have paid more attention to the seller&#x27;s name as they can&#x27;t even spell &amp;#34;BUY&amp;#34; correctly!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t exactly need 3 of these at once, but it&#x27;s the best option.</li>
            <li>I love my Sonicare!</li>
            <li>I have used them for many years!</li>
            <li>Works great, easy to change.</li>
            <li>Great product and easy to find in Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Great product, can easily match with my Electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>If this is anything like the original brush head that came with the Sonicare system, these will work beautifully.</li>
            <li>I think that the brushes do a great job on keeping my teeth clean and it is very easy to use and the brushes have a good wear indicator on them.  </li>
            <li>Sonicare makes an amazing electric toothbrush...</li>
            <li>The Philips Sonicare ProResults Brush Heads are amazing.  </li>
            <li>Great product, hassle free ordering.</li>
            <li>Toothbrush is amazing</li>
            <li>They work great and fit the handle like a glove.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>Sonicare toothbrushes are amazing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know, because I liked the Elite too.    </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re buying replacement brush heads for a toothbrush you already own, why are you even reading these reviews?</li>
            <li>Nice value for the price.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t own an Elite, but it looks like it could also trap liquid and toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>and it cleans my teeth up nicely.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t own a Sonicare system, look into it.  </li>
            <li>They work great and provide the best brush I&#x27;ve ever had, especially as compared to a manual brush.</li>
            <li>Very happy with the price and fast delivery for the brush heads for my sonic electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>nice price, 2 day Amazon prime delivery ...</li>
            <li>Six packs for a cheaper price would be nice.</li>
            <li>Now that&#x27;s a nice trend.</li>
            <li>Thanks again for your excellent response.</li>
            <li>However, since I gladly pay for it and believe that it provides superior cleaning of my teeth</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, while the design of these heads and the toothbrush is nice, it does require continual removal and cleaning.</li>
            <li>It is a nice backup in places where you have no signal, but if it disagrees with your smartphone, just disregard its instructions.</li>
            <li>Sonicare has proven to be effective in promoting tooth/gum care.</li>
            <li>kind of pricey....</li>
            <li>Thank you, kindly.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, excellent product!</li>
            <li>They fit the brush perfectly, unlike many of the &#x27;knock-off&#x27; brands available !....</li>
            <li>I fond these to be good brush heads, better then the compact ones, you have to own a phillips sonic electric tooth brush to make use of these brush heads.</li>
            <li>Love my sonicare toothbruh and these toothbrush heads are awesome and are priced right on Amazon.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s excited to brush his teeth, and I&#x27;m happy with the results on my own teeth.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS A GOOD ORIGINAL REPLACEMENT THAT WORKS VERU GOOD.</li>
            <li>These work great, just like what came with my toothbrush originally.  </li>
            <li>Great replacements to my original brush.</li>
            <li>and it is 100% worth its cost!!!  </li>
            <li>These are great to keep you teeth clean.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome toothbrush that came highly recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li>The Philips Sonicare brush is of high quality and with the ease of reordering brush heads through Amazon, I am happy!</li>
            <li>I forgot why I moved away from these heads, and loved the &#x27;diamond clean&#x27; head as soon as I tried it!  </li>
            <li>Either the manufacturer created defective latest batch or they are very convincing fakes.</li>
            <li>It gets my teeth cleaner than I can clean them with a manual brush, and it is both very effective and easier on my gums.</li>
            <li>These brushes are perfect for the new Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>thought maybe this is a newer version of heads or something, but I bought new heads from Duane Reade again, and they work perfectly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;What&#x27;s most important, you&#x27;ll get a GREAT cleaning every time.  </li>
            <li>and they are priced really good and ship very quick.</li>
            <li>We can&#x27;t say enough good things about how awesome these or the toothbrush itself</li>
            <li>We received them quickly and were happy with the service.</li>
            <li>These brushes fall off the handle very easily.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Pretty good buy after all!  </li>
            <li>They work fine and are a good price.</li>
            <li>When you&#x27;ve purchased the best - you should buy the original replacements to go with it instead of generics (I tried them and it wasn&#x27;t worth it).  </li>
            <li>so was delighted to see that they were available on line.  </li>
            <li>The genuine HX6013 Philips Proresults Brush Heads are a good choice.  </li>
            <li>the Sonicare ProResults is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Found this 3-pack, which is about 1/2 the price at big box stores (I know, I&#x27;ve bought a 3pack there too...), and it is an excellent price, shipped fast, and works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>It is nice to be able to order them and not have to go out to buy them.</li>
            <li>Top notch heads, cheaper then anywhere else, and you own the Philips Sonicare system already.</li>
            <li>It is supposed to be even more effective.</li>
            <li>These obviously are designed for the Phiilips Toothbrush, the excellent toothbrush by Phillips, who produce the toothbrush that is like having your own Dental Hygienist in your bathroom.</li>
            <li>I love electric toothbrush, and Phillips has the best so far.  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t get a good clean.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and we both love it.</li>
            <li>The seller was great, very fast in getting it shipped.</li>
            <li>Finding replacement heads at a very reasonable cost is great.  </li>
            <li>These are the exact brand brush heads and are a great deal.  </li>
            <li>We have used these  toothbrushes very successfully for years because we thought all these kind of toothbrushes work the same.</li>
            <li>Great product and so much cheaper than the market or Costco!  </li>
            <li>The exact product I was looking for at a great price.</li>
            <li>,it was the original and perfect ,thanks</li>
            <li>The refills do exactly what they are supposed to:  provide replacement for the Sonicare brush, which is itself a great tool.</li>
            <li>Great product and consistent quality.</li>
            <li>Great for the whole family!</li>
            <li>I should have know that these brush heads were too good to be true considering their price.  </li>
            <li>The price is quite good for the true Philips brand.  </li>
            <li>these work just fine!</li>
            <li>Far superior to manual tooth brush, this product is very effective in maintaining healthy teeth.</li>
            <li>Good buy and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Clearly many people seem to be happy with this product if you check the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Do not buy these cheap knock-offs!</li>
            <li>Authentic replacement heads do not perform this way.  </li>
            <li>They have way better quality then these.</li>
            <li>We phoned Sonicare and they sent us two more.</li>
            <li>Is it any better than the Elite?  </li>
            <li>I love these Sonicare brushes and they work well</li>
            <li>Better check with Walmart.  </li>
            <li>I love my Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li>ons are better.</li>
            <li>My wife use the same brush heads and very happy with the result.</li>
            <li>Arrived early &amp; fit perfectly!</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using this product and would buy it again.  </li>
            <li>As much as I love my Sonicare toothbrush when these heads run out I will replace the toothbrush...not the heads.</li>
            <li>but I love it.   </li>
            <li>Philips have come up with a solid product here, but remember to replace the brush heads every three months to keep it working its best.  </li>
            <li>These are perfect refill brush-heads (Standard) for the Philips Sonicare FlexCare.</li>
            <li>I feel like they do a better job of cleaning my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>This is a great refill pack for the Sonicare toothbrush and much cheaper then buying it in a store.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely better than the oral B.</li>
            <li>I have had this sonic toothbrush forever and really like it, the heads work great</li>
            <li>Also, it was definitely the best price I found with my online search--I didn&#x27;t have to pay postage.  </li>
            <li>We love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a standard item that you can find anywhere, but I found the best price here.</li>
            <li>If you price power toothbrush heads, sonicare floats to the top everywhere among brands.  </li>
            <li>Best price anywhere that I could find, I \\&quot;subscribed\\&quot; since this is an item that needs renewing every now and then, and ended up saving 40% off regular store prices!</li>
            <li>and my teeth are healthy as ever.</li>
            <li>Love the sonicare toothbrush system.  </li>
            <li>6023 maybe better for guns.</li>
            <li>6013 covers more of teeth area.</li>
            <li>brushes work well and through a combination of better care and using this toothbrush, I&#x27;ve had better visits with my dentist and hygenist.</li>
            <li>I love sonicare.</li>
            <li>I am really pleased with receiving my Sonicare Brush Head in the mail.</li>
            <li>These heads are a lot better than the off brand heads.</li>
            <li>If you get on the subscriber program, the price is better than what you would pay anywhere else.</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>I just purchased the toothbrush about 2 months ago and absolutely love its&#x27; features.</li>
            <li>so I thought the cost of replacement brushheads would be more than the $40.00 I used to pay for those for the Sonicare Elite.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I ordered the correct refills</li>
            <li>I love the Sonicare Flexcare</li>
            <li>just what i was needing. :)</li>
            <li>Now that my 9yo has braces, I bought these to make sure he brushes well.  </li>
            <li>, they replacement heads, originals, they work, I love the tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>I waited longer than I should have and after installed and found teeth cleaning was better and faster.</li>
            <li>Great price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hesistant to buy any more brush heads from Amazon.</li>
            <li>and I have to say that the standard brush head is the best.</li>
            <li>I like the idea of being able to have these when I need them</li>
            <li>I love saving money.</li>
            <li>I love my sonic care system.</li>
            <li>My teeth are healthy.</li>
            <li>To the product, these brush heads are much more hygienic than the precious brush head design.</li>
            <li>and I feel it fits much better in the mouth.</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>HE WILL  LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush, and it means that I need to use the replacement all the time.</li>
            <li>The product is top quality.</li>
            <li>In my wife&#x27;s case I lost the battle, but my kids love the system now and, like me, they couldn&#x27;t do without</li>
            <li>And when it comes to the replacement heads, (which they recommend changing every three months or so) put them on a Subscribe &amp; Save schedule, and you&#x27;ll save even more.  </li>
            <li>I love that it can be put into the dishwasher to be washed as needed.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>If I was stranded on a desert island I&#x27;d need a power source and my sonicare! :)</li>
            <li>Love these brushes..</li>
            <li>it costs more.</li>
            <li>I just wish the price was more in line with the cost of producing these.  </li>
            <li>I probably get only 2 months use at best before the &#x27;reminder bristles&#x27; fade to the point where Sonicare recommends replacement.</li>
            <li>The price here at Amazon is much better than what I&#x27;ve been able to find in stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love my Philips toothbrush.</li>
            <li>and I noticed a difference:)</li>
            <li>The product arrived in only two days in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>Still love my Sonicare</li>
            <li>The more I use it the more I like it.</li>
            <li>but it does not allow me to click the appropriate button.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommend if you want to get the most out of your Sonicare.</li>
            <li>and I have purchased many before.</li>
            <li>So glad to have found them on this site.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush system.</li>
            <li>I love that it can be put into the dishwasher to be washed as needed.  </li>
            <li>So many toothbrushes now on the market</li>
            <li>I love the package of three - now I don&#x27;t need to order again for a while.</li>
            <li>I get that the brush and vibrations are supposed to do most of the work</li>
            <li>Love my Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Love the sonicare brush.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I like this size so much better than the compact heads.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I love these kinds of toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Glad they changed the style...</li>
            <li>I love my Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li>OK, the package looks identical to the one that I purchased from a grocery store.</li>
            <li>These were much better priced than at my local store and they work perfectly in my Sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love brushing with Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Love sonicare, they take all the guesswork out of brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think these are authentic ProResult brush.</li>
            <li>Softer, more reach; can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>My bottom teeth continued to feel \\&quot;gritty\\&quot; no longer how many times I went over them with the brush.</li>
            <li>I am happy to find them reasonably priced through your website.</li>
            <li>It truly makes you confident all around.</li>
            <li>My dental exams/cleanings have been much better since I started using this product.  </li>
            <li>and I am pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Free shipping!</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;ll have to pay even more money ordering from Bed Bath and Beyond</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Sonicare toothbrushes for over a decade, and I love them.</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought the electric toothbrush and the replacements.</li>
            <li>Overall excellent price for these.</li>
            <li>:) Supply and demand works every time.</li>
            <li>Im glad I was able to get three replacements for the price of one</li>
            <li>The price could have been better.</li>
            <li>Could be the name accounts for most of it.</li>
            <li>the option for smaller/larger heads as well, and Amazon definitely has the best price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like that it is more sleek and trim than my wife&#x27;s e-Series.</li>
            <li>I love my Sonicare, but the heads are way too pricey.  </li>
            <li>love the color strands that indicate when it is time to replace.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Continue to use these with the electric toothbrush &amp; my dentist is pleased @</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a Sonicare toothbrush for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>The Philips Sonicare ProResults HX6013 Brush Head Standard 3pk is the best dental product I ever used for dental hygine.</li>
            <li>Most people probably wouldn&#x27;t notice anything though - and perhaps it&#x27;s just my imagination...</li>
            <li>I might add contained 6 bushes and each one lasted for 6 months or more.</li>
            <li>Simply the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>bought these because they were the cheapest but not too sure what happened.</li>
            <li>i like being able to purchase the replacement heads online.  </li>
            <li>but its sure better than the dentist</li>
            <li>Never used an electronic brush till now, but I love it.</li>
            <li>What do you buy as a stocking stuffer when your kid&#x27;s top Christmas wish list item is an electric toothbrush?</li>
            <li>Love it, no complains.</li>
            <li>These brush heads are wonderful and last longer than three months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a Phillips Sonicare for over 2 years and have gone through many brush head replacements.  </li>
            <li>These brush heads lasted at most 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>One of the better prices around.</li>
            <li>so they could come up with something better now?  </li>
            <li>The Sonicare tooth brush is a tremendous asset because these brushes clean so well and leave your mouth feeling great.  </li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>You would pay so much more if you purchased them at a retail store.</li>
            <li>so I know they will be authentic Philips brand brush</li>
            <li>Love the electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are my favorite brush heads for the Sonicare line of toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I let them keep the head :)</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s faster, more efficient, gets everywhere</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still able to use them though.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>These heads rattle on the toothbrush more than the $16 knockoffs I bought on Groupon.</li>
            <li>I do not have much more to say about it than that.</li>
            <li>Work well and fit our electric brush nicely.</li>
            <li>and they are even better than these.</li>
            <li>So much better than the E series ones with that cap like brushes that get moldy underneath.</li>
            <li>We love our Sonicare tooth brush products.  </li>
            <li>The electric toothbrush does a much better job on my teeth than manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>but i like using the sonicare better than manual brush.</li>
            <li>These are authentic Philips brush heads</li>
            <li>I love the level of cleaning I get when I brush with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>They were really cheaply made!</li>
            <li>Love my sonicare toothbrush needed more heads and will be buying more when it is time to refill, every time.</li>
            <li>I love this brand and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re tooth brushes, what more van I say.</li>
            <li>Love Sonicare products.</li>
            <li>Now I see that there is a banner ad at the top of my Amazon page at the moment -- paid for by Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>My hygienist also likes how much better my teeth are, during cleaning appointments,&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Could be the brush I have, has many cycles, and I brush longer than 2 minutes</li>
            <li>Nothing is better.</li>
            <li>This was the most convenient and cheapest method of purchase.</li>
            <li>Much better cleaning than a manual toothbrush</li>
            <li>to a more reliable seller than this one.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>I use these more than the HS6023 compact brush.</li>
            <li>Received promptly, they are as described, packed okay.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so clean I am so pleased!</li>
            <li>It was a good deal and easier than going out looking for the right</li>
            <li>I have to admit, I am not as good remembering to replace at the right time inbetween the shipments.</li>
            <li>Amazon is very competent and the Phillips Sonicare toothbrush was sent quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li>Keeps my teeth nice and clean</li>
            <li>They fit over my Sonicare tooth brush very easily.</li>
            <li>All Sonic care products are great quality Philips products and I recommend them highly.</li>
            <li>Would strongly recommend purchasing from a reputable retailer where you can be sure of their provenance.</li>
            <li>With free super saver shipping, these are a good price for the &#x27;consumable&#x27; part, and it&#x27;s a convenient way to get them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and does a much better job than the manual toothbrushes used for so many years.</li>
            <li>They make my teeth feel VERY clean.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare electric tooth brushes are pretty good and do make a difference for me.  </li>
            <li>Nevertheless, for the first two weeks the brush did a fairly good job cleaning my teeth</li>
            <li>Look if you have the Philips Sonicare, you need these brushes, and I might add they are pretty good and leave you feeling</li>
            <li>This new brush is great.</li>
            <li>we replaced it with a new one and was happy to see that we could get the replacement brushes from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>These fit great, and the real Phillips brand, and this price cannot be beat.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d have an easy time finding and buying the replacement heads</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Sonicares for years and they are simply the best toothbrushes available.    </li>
            <li>My boyfriend use Philips sonicare for several months, he said it is very excellent on his tooth and also this brush head is fit on the philips sonicare.</li>
            <li>I love using the Sonicare, and the brushes are just fine, but why do replacement heads cost $6 each?</li>
            <li>My teeth have never look so clean!</li>
            <li>Love the sonicare system and these replacements work just fine.  </li>
            <li>and I cannot believe how clean my teeth feel!</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t believe how clean my mouth and teeth feel all the time!</li>
            <li>Actually, these are very good.  </li>
            <li>Overall, a very good product.</li>
            <li>however it&#x27;s better than having to get cavities filled and plaque scraped off your teeth by the dentist</li>
            <li>I enjoy that i don&#x27;t have to worry about making sure i have replacement brush head.</li>
            <li>I am 82 years old and my dentist consistently praises&lt;br /&gt;me on my excellent teeth.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive gums and these are great.</li>
            <li>I love our Sonicare toothbrush and these heads fit it.  </li>
            <li>These work great on my old sonicare body.</li>
            <li>Almost as soon as my wife and I put these on our toothbrushes, the bristles started to fray (some even pulled out) and began becoming compressed.  </li>
            <li>And I will save my wrath for something more important.</li>
            <li>Would be great for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>It is important to have good oral health for good overall health.  </li>
            <li>It holds a good charge and the fact that you cradle it each time, it&#x27;s always ready.</li>
            <li>The service is fast - I love being able to have it on auto order every three months!  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted for my Sonicare, it came to me fast, and and it was a good price!</li>
            <li>The packaging was sealed and in good shape, and the product itself is exactly like the original that came with my toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I have bought before, but Amazon had the best price then any other place.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more familiar with, as these will get trashed.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare ProResults brush heads are great, and a huge improvement over the old design.</li>
            <li>It effectibely removes all plaque and is compact and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Well, it does.. feel more clean.</li>
            <li>They are durable and they clean your teeth way better than brushing manually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is easy to clip on to the sonicare brush.  </li>
            <li>Compact and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Very quick service</li>
            <li>My brush heads easily fell off while brushing.</li>
            <li>which is supposed to clean even better.  </li>
            <li>They are easy to install.</li>
            <li>These brush heads are easy to pop on or off for sharing the handle with others.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel nice and clean after brushing and these heads to not wear out particularly quickly.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, they fit my Flexcare.</li>
            <li>These heads leave a gap between them and the handle of the toothbrush where toothpaste residue can easily accumulate.</li>
            <li>The replacement heads are easy to find at Amazon at a cheaper price than what we have here on Guam...</li>
            <li>I think I like the Diamond Clean heads better.  </li>
            <li>Shipped very quickly</li>
            <li>No matter how many times I brush with a manual brush, I cannot achieve the clean feeling I get after using a Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Easy to replace.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to forget to replace them as often as one should.</li>
            <li>Easy on and easy off.</li>
            <li>This order shipped quickly, the products were packaged wonderfully, thus making the entire experience fabulous.</li>
            <li>Have to say that they have made it easy to order online though.</li>
            <li>Heads just snap on and are easy to change.</li>
            <li>These are copies of the OEM and it&#x27;s easy to tell.</li>
            <li>So easy, it&#x27;s a pleasure to brush.</li>
            <li>I have been reading in the reviews about how these lose bristles and flatten out very quickly.</li>
            <li>They flatten out very quickly and become ineffective between the teeth.</li>
            <li>That is an EXCELLENT toothbrush, and in the nearly 3 years I have been using it, my teeth have been MUCH healthier.</li>
            <li>I strongly recomended it</li>
            <li>I own the Philips Sonicare that calls for these replacements which my husband and I like very much.  </li>
            <li>High quality at a good price.</li>
            <li>If you expect it to do anything more special, it wont.</li>
            <li>you are looking at these heads, then you more than likely already own the Sonicare system and already know how amazing the system is.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the fast service from Amazon.</li>
            <li>The best way to drive the price down on this product is to not buy it.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be a long shot in getting it to fit my toothbrush, but luckily they fir perfectly</li>
            <li>This is the third Philips Sonicare toothbrush I have purchased, the first through AMAZON,  and I find it excellent.</li>
            <li>They worked fine but these Proresult snap</li>
            <li>These are replacement brush heads for the fine Philips Sonicare tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>They do their job just fine.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush heads work fine.  </li>
            <li>size is fine for his mouth.  </li>
            <li>They worked fine.</li>
            <li>It brushes fine.</li>
            <li>These replacement brushes securely and easily attach to the unit.</li>
            <li>I was fine</li>
            <li>I have ordered Phillips Sonicare replacement brushheads off of Amazon before and they have been fine.</li>
            <li>so it appears that the toothbrush is still fine.</li>
            <li>Delivery went fine.</li>
            <li>These work just fine on my Sonicare brush</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a toothbrush head and works just fine.  </li>
            <li>Its fine.</li>
            <li>Product is fine.</li>
            <li>I received another set and they work fine.  </li>
            <li>Fine product.</li>
            <li>they cost less on here and work great!</li>
            <li>These are OEM replacements so work just fine.</li>
            <li>I should say the brushes themselves were fine, otherwise.</li>
            <li>Amazon pricing is better than I have found elsewhere and delivery is quick.</li>
            <li>The price is cheaper than the store, get them quick, and they are perfect-what more can I ask for?</li>
            <li>They wear out WAY TOO QUICKLY!</li>
            <li>Its amazing how much better your sonic brushing is with a new head...</li>
            <li>the brush head the original tooth brush came with had strong bristles and loved it so after 6 months of usage, it was time to get new brush heads</li>
            <li>These work fine, fit the toothbrush fine.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;they fit and work fine on my brush.</li>
            <li>They stay on just fine, but they don&#x27;t compare to the ones available four years ago.</li>
            <li>These work just fine if they fit.  </li>
            <li>I should have returned them but ran out to Harmon, bought them again and they fit fine.</li>
            <li>Convenient little devils; take them off the Philips Sonicare brush and they become perfect travel size brushes, and the color-coded rings are helpful for sharing the vibrating part.</li>
            <li>I like the best was they come in a little cover for the heads</li>
            <li>They are very comfortable and get into all the right places.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the indicator is accurate on when to change the brush head...</li>
            <li>I bought them on Amazon for such a great price with free shipping.  </li>
            <li>I bought these brush heads a year ago, and the difference between then and now is huge.  </li>
            <li>These heads fit the easy clean sonic care.</li>
            <li>I picked this rating because the brush heads fit .  </li>
            <li>I saved money, got free shipping</li>
            <li>My wife is a fervent user of this toothbrush but everywhere we looked in town, the replacement heads weren&#x27;t available.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t even available at the Philips online store.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;d be great if Philips Sonicare offered different size heads or bristle types.</li>
            <li>It is important to replace your Sonicare electric toothbrush heads about every 3 months so the brushing will remain effect at cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li>These brushes are comfortable to use and hold up to all of the brushing minutes.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush itself is more updated,streamlined,efficient, feature laden and fun to use</li>
            <li>but I just pushed them in securely and they fit.  </li>
            <li>I was amazed at how well the sculpted contoured bristles fit the curves of my gumline and teeth.  </li>
            <li>When my Elite died after 6 years, I replaced it with a Flexcare because the smaller, lighter size and dual voltage made it great for traveling overseas.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All genuine too</li>
            <li>We tried all three and none would fit.  </li>
            <li>Phillips Sonicare HX6013 ProResults Brush Head Standard, 3-Pack, is a great product.  </li>
            <li>and  I have used this brush with whitening paste and now they feel fabulous.</li>
            <li>Service was fantastic and I would recommend these brush heads and sonicare to everyone</li>
            <li>They fit inside the UV light holster.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Thank you for providing this important product.........</li>
            <li>The heads fit the [[ASIN:B000UK2W4C</li>
            <li>BUT SUCH A GREAT PRICE.  </li>
            <li>Worked with my current sonicare and I would recommend to anyone looking for a great deal for replacement brush heads</li>
            <li>You pay more but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>Great price after shopping online and at local retailers for a sonicare replacement head</li>
            <li>but it un-attaches before I&#x27;ve finished even a light brush cycle, which means that A)</li>
            <li>but they sound like junk immediately, and look like junk after a month.  </li>
            <li>They are cheaper than the heads in stores, but appear to be the same quality, so I am happy.</li>
            <li>but if you look closely their logos are blurry, the brush heads don&#x27;t fit, and they have to be replace every 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe these are Philips Sonicare brush heads, but they do fit and look official with a part number printed on them.</li>
            <li>Makes me want to smile more.</li>
            <li>Sonicare electric toothbrushes have been such great products, I truly hope this is not a ploy by Sonicare to spur sales of replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li>They fit, just as stated.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m giving this two stars because Amazon was great about taking them back.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t want to sound paranoid.</li>
            <li>Comfortable brush head.</li>
            <li>This does not look like a genuine product.</li>
            <li>I purchased these brush heads several months ago and they were great.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to buy the 3 pack since I was unsure if it would fit the toothbrushing unit</li>
            <li>Free shipping and no taxes are a plus.  </li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s free shipping is what I look for.</li>
            <li>They brush well and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>However, if the diamonds weren&#x27;t available, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to order these again.</li>
            <li>Great product; will be buying these in the future from now on.</li>
            <li>which is useful in a household with more than one toothbrush that uses this type of brush head.</li>
            <li>I added these brushes to our automatic subscription to take advantage of the added discount and free shipping.</li>
            <li>and we are happy with the overall experience.</li>
            <li>Neither fit my Sonicare</li>
            <li>Much better quality and worth the price.</li>
            <li>They fit which was my biggest concern.  </li>
            <li>There is no way that these brushes cost even 5% of the price charged to make, but like razor blades, the company could give away the handle for free and make a fortune selling just the brushes.  </li>
            <li>Even the printing looks cheap compared to genuine Philips Sonicare brushes.</li>
            <li>I was happy in receiving these on a time to have extra heads.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>These fit the Philips Sonicare HX6733/80</li>
            <li>This is a great price for these replacement heads and the quality is just the same as the ones that came with my Phillips Toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The don&#x27;t feel cheap and tend to hold up well.</li>
            <li>One of the brush heads didn&#x27;t fit the unit.  </li>
            <li>They fit my handle.</li>
            <li>Fit my sonicare just as stated.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is great because you can recharge it using any current.</li>
            <li>Great for travel outside the US.</li>
            <li>These brushes exactly fit the brush that I have.</li>
            <li>The description fit just what I got.</li>
            <li>They fit my Philips Sonicare ProResults tooth brush</li>
            <li>Then I  order from different supplier, then they are great.</li>
            <li>This one does a good job, but we had one brush (so far) that would not stay on the motor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started another one, and so far so good.</li>
            <li>I first liked the \\&quot;Compact Head\\&quot; model, but now I prefer this \\&quot;Full Head\\&quot; size and the contoured bristles.</li>
            <li>Love it, does the job right.</li>
            <li>This item does not go on sale very often and having it locked in to a regular price and delivered to my door is very nice!</li>
            <li>These are the same brush heads that come when you buy your toothbrush new, they work fine and fit the sonicare flexcare perfectly</li>
            <li>It is lightweight yet sturdy and very effective, especially with whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Philips has created a perfect scenario for counterfeiters by charging such extremely high prices for a product that is extremely cheap to manufacture.  </li>
            <li>It make our teeth feel very clean and fresh every day and night</li>
            <li>These fit our unit and work just like the original ones.  </li>
            <li>but somehow I have a feeling that they fit not as snug as the original two that came with the unit.</li>
            <li>but they are definitely are an investment because I am proud to smile my nice new smile! :)</li>
            <li>In order to qualify for the rebate and the free replacement head you have to return an original receipt and an original UPC symbol from the package.  </li>
            <li>Pretty sure this is not the genuine replace heads from Philips.</li>
            <li>Love both very much.</li>
            <li>They fit going on, but as soon as I turn my toothbrush on and start brushing they slide right off!</li>
            <li>The brushes are good, just a wee bit soft for my taste, but are adequate.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>My original brush head lasted me 3 months like it should</li>
            <li>This was equivalent to the original brush head I received with the Sonic Care HX6530 ProResults.  </li>
            <li>Customer Service Representative suggested that if it were given as a gift I should have ask for original copies of receipts.   </li>
            <li>No suggest for the original UPC gifen for a gift.  </li>
            <li>The original was purchased in 8/09.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The prices have more than doubled since my first one.</li>
            <li>so it scores again with us and with another product priced significantly lower than anywhere else.</li>
            <li>all seem to be original products.. will use this shop again</li>
            <li>Not only do we love it, but we&#x27;re getting better checkups too!</li>
            <li>I wish it was a bit cheaper then its original price.</li>
            <li>Item arrived in original package as specified in sellers ad.</li>
            <li>I originally wanted to purchase the brush heads from Amazon because the price at the big-box stores has increased significantly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I got the shaft on this one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure these are knockoffs of the original.</li>
            <li>A FROM THE ORIGINAL MANUFACTURER????&lt;br /&gt;BRUSH HEAD DOES NOT SEEM UP TO QUALITY</li>
            <li>(I ordered some with my original handle purchase).  </li>
            <li>They are just like the original.  </li>
            <li>Well, they should be identical to what comes with the original toothbrush</li>
            <li>My mouth is small and I have ocasional bleedings so this is the best to go with your Philips sonicare.</li>
            <li>You gotta buy the original ProResults replacements.  </li>
            <li>genuine parts, the full size, and work well.</li>
            <li>a person with a long history of cavities and tooth/gum issues, I can proudly say since I started using these</li>
            <li>the original head my Sonicare came with, and</li>
            <li>Just like the original one that came on the brush.</li>
            <li>original-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased these in the past &amp; they were great!</li>
            <li>I just ordered these after the original brush lasted me two years.</li>
            <li>I would spend the extra money to make sure you&#x27;re getting an authentic product and don&#x27;t damage your gums!</li>
            <li>The product is the original manufacturers item.</li>
            <li>I did some real searching for saving on purchasing my brush heads and certainly made a good find with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>Product is very good, I was for a friend, a friend like after use, next time will be in to buy, thanks</li>
            <li>My teeth are clean...?</li>
            <li>These brush heads, along with my Phillips Sonicare HealthyWhite toothbrush, make for a thorough, dentist like clean every time.</li>
            <li>I feel like my mouth isn&#x27;t clean unless I use my Phillips HealthyWhite with these brush heads.  </li>
            <li>Super cheap &amp; convenient compared to purchasing from Dentist or Store.</li>
            <li>even if you don&#x27;t pay shipping, they are way too expensive for what they are, but if you own and use this excellent tooth brush-</li>
            <li>Want to have squeaky clean - just had a cleaning @</li>
            <li>the dentist clean.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for this in all the Publix and supermarket near my house, I finally found it on Amazon and is perfect!</li>
            <li>I have no problem keeping my teeth clean now.</li>
            <li>They keep my teeth so clean.</li>
            <li>I feel clean all the time.  </li>
            <li>and I do the two-minute &#x27;Clean&#x27; mode</li>
            <li>I drop these into a water glass with denture cleaner about once a week to clean them and my manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>how clean my teeth get.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush will clean your teeth like the professionals at the dentist.</li>
            <li>my teeth are squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>They clean your teeth and make you feel as if you had just been to the dentist for a cleaning.</li>
            <li>3 pack makes it easy to keep up with having a fresh brush.</li>
            <li>My teeth are shiny clean.</li>
            <li>Clean just like they are supposed too.  </li>
            <li>Good brushes, hold up pretty good as long as you don&#x27;t apply to much force (which you should not do anyway).</li>
            <li>Nothing special to write about.</li>
            <li>YEAH RIGHT!</li>
            <li>I love the sonicare toothbrush, they really keep my teeth thoroughly clean.</li>
            <li>Received in a short time, great price, appreciated the product availability which made replacing our product easy and quick.</li>
            <li>We alternate days brushing with Braun Oral-B and feel that the combination of the two electric tooth brushes does a good job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sonicare wants us to buy more often.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if there are any true benefits to getting a whitening version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These brush last about 6 months, so it&#x27;s good to have an auto refill.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I both didn&#x27;t believe the claim that this system would actually whiten your teeth, but we have noticed good results.</li>
            <li>...at a fair price.    I&#x27;ve been using a Sonicare for several years now.</li>
            <li>The system really works--I love my Philips Sonicare, and I couldn&#x27;t imagine NOT using it now.</li>
            <li>It has made my teeth SO much cleaner (no plaque), my gums are in much better shape and my teeth are whiter.</li>
            <li>Wish they had some good generic ones, but by others reviews, that is not the case.</li>
            <li>I love my Phillips sonicare toothbrush, but it&#x27;s really a luxury at these prices.  </li>
            <li>the brushes go one easy and are simple and stay nice and clean.</li>
            <li>It has made my teeth SO much cleaner (no plaque), my gums are in much better shape and my teeth are whiter.  </li>
            <li>and my mouth is still full of toothpaste--it&#x27;s a nightmare.</li>
            <li>Is that good enough?</li>
            <li>how I love the newer style brushes; much easier to remove and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like these better than the &amp;#34;bulkier E Series&amp;#34; replacement head.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have the replacement heads to pop on about every 3 months,when the old one needs replacing.</li>
            <li>Overall, these heads do a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought a 3pk for my sonicare flexcare+ 6072/6950 brush model, fit perfectly and looks the same as my default old brush head that came with the toothbrush itself when I first bought it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect such a good quality</li>
            <li>Glad there is a replacement for my electric toothbrush since I paid so much money for it.  </li>
            <li>However, I try to frame the cost in terms of the savings I accrue by taking such good care of my teeth.</li>
            <li>This product not only brushes your teeth, but also stimulates your gums for good oral health.  </li>
            <li>There is something nice and exciting about brushing your teeth with a new brush head..feels like you just went to the dentist</li>
            <li>Amazon is a little high, but when you figure in the free shipping, perfect!</li>
            <li>They definitely don&#x27;t fit right though.</li>
            <li>now I can just use these and replace more frequently because they are cheaper and they ship so quickly!  </li>
            <li>A great plus was that I received them extremely fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased with the shipment and inspite of the other issues with the order, I still was able to use this after an awesome in-store purchase for the same model Sonicare toothbrush</li>
            <li>With daily use the brush heads probably last around 2 months at best.</li>
            <li>I checked many local and internet stores and couldn&#x27;t find this item for a better price.  </li>
            <li>The Philips Sonicare Brush Heads are some of the most expensive to replace and Amazon.com has the best deal.</li>
            <li>Came quick.</li>
            <li>They cover my teeth much better and feel more like a regular sized toothbrush in my mouth.</li>
            <li>Simply replacement heads for specific Sonicare toothbrush handles (FlexCare &amp; ProResults), which I believe are the best electric toothbrush systems.  </li>
            <li>I was happy to find these replacement heads for my Sonicare for such a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>The brushes had worn out too quickly.</li>
            <li>The last ones I purchased were through a different seller and they were perfect.  </li>
            <li>Seem more durable than older models.</li>
            <li>And the brush seems to wear out quickly.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was quick as well...</li>
            <li>I also ordered this product and received it quickly.</li>
            <li>Super product.  </li>
            <li>arrived quickly and as described.  </li>
            <li>Came quick.</li>
            <li>The product shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying brush replacements for the ProResults Sonicare model and have never had one wear out so quickly.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Love these brush heads Always ordering more since I can&#x27;t get enough of them and need extras for traveling and stuff.</li>
            <li>Came quickly.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much easier to clean!</li>
            <li>These brush heads seem pretty comfortable to use and they seem to hold up about as well as the heavier Sonicare brush heads.  </li>
            <li>and they fit my toothbrush exactly.</li>
            <li>Great for braces, these LARGER Sonicare brushes are a lot better for braces than the smaller ones.</li>
            <li>A very reasonable price for this item!</li>
            <li>Very Satisfied, I would definitely order again from this company.</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended Sonicare a long time ago and remarks each time I see him how good my teeth look.  </li>
            <li>It appears to be, but it doesn&#x27;t fit quite right on the toothbrush and after using it for a while, it just pops right off.  </li>
            <li>I loved these larger heads and the price beat those of the large chain stores!</li>
            <li>I received this new tooth brushes I could feel a HUGE difference!</li>
            <li>The new model is much better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The new top of the line brush for Flexcare is $35 for 3.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>every new set, you get more colored bands to denote whose is whose.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with my new Flex-Care Plus toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love my Sonicare toothbrush and couldn&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>So they work, they were new, and I was satisfied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a Sonicare for many years but this is a new model.  </li>
            <li>so I am very pleased being able to have the brushes delivered on a predictable schedule</li>
            <li>They are a perfect toothbrush , long lasting and durable.</li>
            <li>Sonicare is the only one he&lt;br /&gt;mentioned, and am I glad!</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for and needed!  </li>
            <li>Only authentic replacements from now on!</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s small, light, a very nice gadget.</li>
            <li>I received quick service and it was priced right.</li>
            <li>I think that is a bit much, 6 months is fine,</li>
            <li>This whole combination is a fantastic product for oral hygiene</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re ready to enjoy your FlexCare.  </li>
            <li>It fit my sonicare toothbrush perfectly at a much lower cost.</li>
            <li>it seems they are a cheap knock-off of the real Philips replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li>Either way, they are worth it.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s all mostly worth it in the end.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, sonicare&#x27;s plastic appears to be virgin (no regrind added to the mix) which in this day of injection molding is a rare item to find.  </li>
            <li>Brushing teeth has never been so much fun.</li>
            <li>as expected , good product , recommended.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased one of the newer models and I enjoy it much more now that I have braces</li>
            <li>I have a healthy white sonicare, I want to know if these will fit my brush?</li>
            <li>but well worth the difference in price.</li>
            <li>You can probably replace them every 6 months to get your money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>They fit better,feel better and last longer.</li>
            <li>If they did I&#x27;d say they were well worth it.</li>
            <li>I thought, for sure Amazon would have fixed this by now.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit our Healthy White toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>More cost efficient in the 3-pack, these sonic brush-heads last a while and leave your teeth feeling smooth.  </li>
            <li>Still a great product, especially if you don&#x27;t need sensitive brush heads.</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a powerful brush, then use these heads.  </li>
            <li>These toothbrush heads don&#x27;t quite fit the Healthy White, despite being the &amp;#34;official&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re worth every penny to me.</li>
            <li>They are over-priced IMO, but some things are worth splurging on.</li>
            <li>Bristles seem to soft and inconsistent to be authentic.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush and the replacement heads are definitely worth the cost.</li>
            <li>For the price for 3 of them, to me, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;re happy with these brush heads, and the price is exactly half of what we saw at Costco!  </li>
            <li>I bought the extra brushes ahead due to the excellent price.  </li>
            <li>and I have never been more satisfied with any other toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Package came on time (quickly), product was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>I like that the brush heads are not as large as the Braun and it leaves my teeth feeling just as clean.</li>
            <li>Another amazing thing about these brush heads is I am amazed at how clean the bristles get the surface of the tooth without being rough on the gum line.</li>
            <li>Also, the brush heads don&#x27;t feel quite right too.</li>
            <li>This gave me the right info to know</li>
            <li>They look like the right brush heads</li>
            <li>The bristles turned to a grayish color right away.</li>
            <li>I suspect that the reviewer who thought these were &amp;#34;factory seconds&amp;#34; was probably right on the money.  </li>
            <li>Well, lets try it again, put it on, turn it on, vibrated right off again.</li>
            <li>Yes, no doubt, it is working perfectly right now.</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t made right.</li>
            <li>The price is right -</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are just the right size.</li>
            <li>(Yes, I bought the right ones.)</li>
            <li>Yes, they were the right ones.</li>
            <li>It is the right head, though, and it came packaged well.  </li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>These are so much easier to clean and are cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Really clean your whole mouth well.</li>
            <li>they were the &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; tooth brush heads but these particular ones and cheap.</li>
            <li>You can get these anywhere, it is just easier here and usually a bit more cost effective.</li>
            <li>After 2 months, the brush doesn&#x27;t clean very well</li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon is also offering a good price compared to other sources, so I have to say this is overall a good product at a good price, and if treated properly it could last a year.</li>
            <li>And best of all a super low price, half of some places!</li>
            <li>The other tiny heads are great for nooks and crannies, but you cover more surface area with these bristles, meaning each tooth receives more brushing in the same time period.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon, for making that right!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: these brushes are perfect replacements for several models of the Sonicare line, at a slight discount (maybe 20%) off retail.</li>
            <li>Apparently, I brush more vigorously than my wife and son.  </li>
            <li>Pretty rare for someone my age, and I believe that a lot of that has to do with this brush</li>
            <li>The first one I used was good, but then neither of the other two would stay on my toothbrush when I was brushing.</li>
            <li>brush is awesome, and my cleanings that I get done at regular intervals, every 6 months, go with little problems because of this brush.</li>
            <li>On top of that the packaging is different than normal and it doesn&#x27;t seem to fit on the tooth brush quite right.</li>
            <li>Shipped super fast</li>
            <li>Not Amazon&#x27;s fault but Sonicare should consider selling the replacement heads for less overhead and keep folks brushing their teeth with good quality brushes.</li>
            <li>still good none the less.</li>
            <li>Cheap, don&#x27;t fit into toothbrush properly</li>
            <li>At least I got something useful lol.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and the new design is much lighter than it&#x27;s older models.</li>
            <li>The ProResults model does a very good job, is light weight and the charger requires very little counter space (slightly larger than the size of the tooth</li>
            <li>but the right replacement parts are essential rather than cheap knock offs!</li>
            <li>and they came very fast after I had order them.</li>
            <li>It helps me to remember to change the heads on time and the price is very reasonable compared to shopping in stores.</li>
            <li>Not much to report other than these are great!</li>
            <li>Purchased for about 1/2 the price on along lasting good cleaning toothbrushes &amp; got them quick with low shipping cost.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found on the Internet how to remove the Top from the Main Body of the Toothbrush but getting the old brush off the \\&quot;gearings\\</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll know it&#x27;s time to replace the brush when the old bristles start to spread out, but just to be sure, the replacements come with handy little month stickers that you can put on your charger base.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bristle feels very soft than the original brush head.</li>
            <li>Loose fit and pulls off easily</li>
            <li>Then it just didn&#x27;t feel right - the bristles felt too soft, and my teeth didn&#x27;t feel clean.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought I was being too aggressive with my brushing</li>
            <li>Husband really needed these!</li>
            <li>buy-in is pretty costly $100</li>
            <li>Thanks Sonicare!</li>
            <li>I feel like the cost of my toothbrush gets higher after every year.</li>
            <li>The packaging wasn&#x27;t damaged at all and arrived very promptly!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I do not think they have soft ones for sonicare available  </li>
            <li>They are exactly what we needed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered this exact same product in the past and it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>Not only this, but shipping is free!</li>
            <li>THANKS AMAZON!</li>
            <li>the only one drawback for this package is they dont&#x27; come with the color ring for each head, so it will get confuse sometimes if i have more than 2 brushes at home</li>
            <li>But, I think Philips has too many different models</li>
            <li>This is the first part of a subscription.  </li>
            <li>The first 2 worked well.</li>
            <li>I like these heads better than the smaller heads.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what we needed</li>
            <li>So use Sonicare gently, exactly how they describe.    </li>
            <li>I purchased these toothbrush heads for my Healthy White Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>(my most recent Sonicare brush) for at least&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had already purchased my first ever electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>You can not only save up to 15 percent on the S &amp; S, but you can also request a more liberal replacement subscription schedule if you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do know that this powerful system with these brush heads really do the trick for me.</li>
            <li>when I first start brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not my favorite way to spend 1-2 minutes several times per day....</li>
            <li>Love Sonicare Electric Toothbrush for extra care for teeth.  </li>
            <li>They worked perfectly even though I&#x27;m always skeptical.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed and seem to be cheaper than in the stores.  </li>
            <li>After the first couple of uses the heads repeatedly come off as you are trying to brush.  </li>
            <li>this is EXACTLY what you are looking for.</li>
            <li>However, for this style brush refill, the standard size works better.  </li>
            <li>The product was exactly as I had ordered.</li>
            <li>The bristles are abnormally soft when compared to genuine HX6013 brush heads.</li>
            <li>Thanks!  </li>
            <li>They are soft and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush heads DO NOT last more then two months though</li>
            <li>The product came exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>These replacement brushes are exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Absolutely junk!</li>
            <li>You get exactly whats shown.</li>
            <li>They work great and last a long time.</li>
            <li>I use them on the Sonicare Healthy White.</li>
            <li>Not the same quality as the brush which came with my Sonicare, but for the price, I do not mind replacing more often.</li>
            <li>Bristles started falling out within the first week.  </li>
            <li>The bristles started to come out after first use.  </li>
            <li>First time I have had an issue with these heads.</li>
            <li>First time sonciare brush user.</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended I get a Sonicare as it would help keep my teeth and gums in better shape between cleaning if I use it regularly.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for making it affordable!</li>
            <li>I especially like the timed brushing to be sure I do get two minutes of brushing done.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The first two brushes wore out within a week and had errant bristles falling off.</li>
            <li>and i win by sucker punching her in the boob.&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>Exactly as stated, they are exactly as they appear in the ad and to the one in the grocery store.  </li>
            <li>ive been using the first one now still for months already.</li>
            <li>Although the packaging was very convincing and official looking and actually said &amp;#34;Philips&amp;#34;, the performance of the brush heads was nowhere near the stock heads that came with the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I changed more often than that, I&#x27;d just be providing a larger profit for Philips Sonicare.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>And, after using it for the first time, the bristles looked rather frayed...  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve had this happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have bought them from many different places.  </li>
            <li>You pay alot more for the same product at CVS, Rite Aid or even Target or Walmart.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I made sure these were the proper head replacements for my toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I have searched my email but there does not appear to be a reply from them regarding the faulty first brush.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s another fee for return shipping on top of the initial cost for shipping in the first place.</li>
            <li>These work great and last a long time but are way overprice for what they are.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you buy the correct replacement heads as there are a lot out there for the various Sonic toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While these brush heads are not terribly expensive, they are certainly more than a regular manual brush.</li>
            <li>The first one I took out of the package kept popping off the end of my toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Heads for Healthy White Toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This latest order is further proof.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what we were looking for.  </li>
            <li>remember using these for the first time.  </li>
            <li>I have read where these don&#x27;t do any better job than an regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>These replacement brushes are exact replacements for the Phillips Sonicare HX6013 electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>exactly what i needed.</li>
            <li>Pretty durable product.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I was very pleased to see that these refills appear to be OEM and at a fraction of the cost compared to Wal-mart and other retail stores!</li>
            <li>The good news is that because the toothbrush portion of the unit is so much simpler, a replacement pack of three FlexCare toothbrush heads costs less than what I paid for a two pack of Elite replacement heads.</li>
            <li>it works like I expected it, but i didn&#x27;t really notice it being dramatically more clean or whatever.  </li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, these are identical to the original head that came with the tooth brush---no complaints from me.</li>
            <li>You think that your head isn&#x27;t worn down until you feel how much more powerful the toothbrush is with a fresh head.</li>
            <li>I sectioned an old brush and looked for signs of regrind additives and could no find one spek in the whole brush-head shaft 45 degree cut using polarized light and a 100x</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit very well with my Sonicare tooth brush, brush went soft and dis formed after a couple weeks of use.</li>
            <li>(actually, it arrived before Amazon suggested which was super cool with the Christmas holiday being a factor), and was exactly as advertised...  </li>
            <li>Our 3 month old brushes that came with the unit are in better shape than these 1 week old replacements.  </li>
            <li>These do not appear to be authentic Phillips brand brush heads and are too soft, look completely worn out after about 1 weeks use.  </li>
            <li>These brush heads work well and are more reasonably priced than in our local stores.</li>
            <li>I love my sonicare toothbrush and this alows me to purchase replacement heads much cheaper than local department stores offer.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind a little splashing then this large head is good and gets the job done fast.</li>
            <li>Not much to say about the heads without mentioning that the Sonicare very easy on your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>Read carefully and make sure this is the right replacement head for your sonicare</li>
            <li>HX6013 last long (3 month lifespan is the manufacturer recommendation, but they can easily last 5-6 months if treated properly), they fit with a (literal) snap of your fingers and do the best job of all the competitors I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had about 10 days of use on the first head, it is already flattening out and deteriorating, much like you would expect after 3 months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They last about six months which is just right and are identical to the original brush head that came with my unit.</li>
            <li>- The most recent batch of brushes has a VERY snug fit on the stem of the handle; I wonder if they (whoever actually makes these) have changed suppliers or something.  </li>
            <li>Needed a new brush head and this was affordable and worth it.</li>
            <li>It was terrific to get them so easily through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I matched the specs on the type &amp; model of the Sonicare I own but found within less than a week I was having to hold onto the toothbrush head to keep in intact while I brush.</li>
            <li>My oldest son uses the gray one and my youngest one uses the blue one and they come on and off fairly easily.  </li>
            <li>They all come with three different color rings that are easy to snap on or off</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t replace them every 3 or 6 months --- use them for a year or more, they work just fine even after that long --- and my dentist can back me up.</li>
            <li>Great product, use them for past 2 years and see considerable improvement in my oral health.</li>
            <li>Certainly I am saving trips to dentist.  </li>
            <li>Buy the Philips heads from your dentist to be certain.</li>
            <li>These heads are almost certainly counterfeit.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s in large part to my Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is no reason for this apart for pure greed.</li>
            <li>Google Maps and anything on a smart phone would create smarter routes, but this thing does not need the internet.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it stays charged for at least 10 days, making it easy to travel without worry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered these many times, but the ones I just opened are such soft bristles I tossed them in 1-week!</li>
            <li>The package itself looked fine, but when I opened it, it was immediately obvious</li>
            <li>They work fine and hold up to three months with twice daily use.</li>
            <li>Philips is evidently taking its cue from the inkjet printer manufacturers -- lowball the main product, then charge all outdoors for the replacement parts.</li>
            <li>And the toothbrush itself is very high quality.</li>
            <li>Although the warranty is clear on the ORIGINAL date of purchase, it seems to me that Philips wouldn&#x27;t want to replace this handle and start a new warrant period.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare ProResults is the best electric  toothbrush ever made and the toothbrush heads which are very expensive, are very reasonable on Amazon&#x27;s subscription plan.  </li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t fit on my Sonicare handle properly.  </li>
            <li>So I can&#x27;t really take advantage of the discount.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone who wants to preserve the health of his teeth and gums.    </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t fall in this trap, as I have found that these heads are very well made and durable.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s all I can really say.</li>
            <li>these are real Philips heads and cheapest price around.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Obviously, they do not want to honor any rebates or free replacement heads.  </li>
            <li>It does an OK job in cleaning, but not much stain removal.</li>
            <li>Also, shipping was fast and you&#x27;re buying from Amazon</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner with Sonicare</li>
            <li>I even feel my teeth cleaner for much longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks for a quality item.</li>
            <li>Even though it is recommended to change them every 2-3 months, I have used mine much longer because they don&#x27;t show signs of wear until the 4th or 5th month.  </li>
            <li>They did not sell replacement brush heads however, so I did an online Google search and after much comparison shopping found them at an affordable price from an Amazon.com vendor.</li>
            <li>If I replaced the brushes as much as I \\&quot;should\\&quot; according to how they feel and</li>
            <li>I have been using Sonicare products for about 10 years now, and really like them.  </li>
            <li>They contain a wear mark that will disappear when the are ready to be changed.</li>
            <li>DELIVERY WAS VERY PROMPT</li>
            <li>I found these replacement heads to work very well.</li>
            <li>but really didn&#x27;t give me an explanation of why the product was defective.  </li>
            <li>My model is #HX6710 and they claimed the ProResults Standard would fit my brush.  </li>
            <li>I really like these toothbrush heads.  </li>
            <li>The brushes really do the job.</li>
            <li>Thanks Sonicare.</li>
            <li>seems to run out much sooner than the 3 months.</li>
            <li>the real thing, yes</li>
            <li>These brush heads work very well.  </li>
            <li>Look for the real Philips brand brush heads.</li>
            <li>It has enough speeds to find one you feel comfortable with.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll really notice how much cleaner your teeth feel and whiter</li>
            <li>SONICARE THE REAL THING</li>
            <li>It really made me appreciate the performance of the real thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like these tooth brush heads.</li>
            <li>Very convenient.</li>
            <li>I really like the Sonicare</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>so I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a knockoff.</li>
            <li>They work really well.  </li>
            <li>I guess I really have no choice in the matter unless I want to give up my sonicare.</li>
            <li>The brushes deteriorated fast and appear to be counterfeit.</li>
            <li>Real sonicare brushes</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>They fit and they last.  </li>
            <li>This is very misleading that it states USA but ships from the UK.  </li>
            <li>you have really cleaned your teeth and hence my rating.</li>
            <li>3 of these heads cost about as much as 2 of the e-Series heads.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s holding up very well.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t even find the brush heads for the PRO in the store, so this is really convenient.</li>
            <li>(I have never seen numbers on the real brushes and I have had my toothbrush for over 2 years</li>
            <li>and they confirmed they were the correct brushes for the toothbrush, and said they obviously were faulty.  </li>
            <li>Bristles fell out and brushes really stunk..</li>
            <li>This product has worked very well for years.  </li>
            <li>bought these because they are much cheaper than the stores..</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t the real deal.  </li>
            <li>Even a seller may not know as the packaging looks so real.</li>
            <li>I believe this will really help me.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve read that some of the generic ones don&#x27;t fit well</li>
            <li>I have RA and this really helps with holding a toothbrush and reaching all areas of my teeth.</li>
            <li>but it really gets in between the teeth and gum lines.  </li>
            <li>For you dentists out there, it has really solved my gingivitis problems......</li>
            <li>and it cleans your teeth fast..........</li>
            <li>Genuine brush heads usually last in excess of their three month lifespan.&lt;br</li>
            <li>these heads are very durable.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t care for them as much as these.</li>
            <li>It really just depends.</li>
            <li>more..delivery was fast .</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recently I purchased these toothbrush heads thinking that they were legit only to find out that they are cheap FAKES and do not work.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The real ones maintain their structural integrity for months.</li>
            <li>I could have used them much longer.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>but I still resent how much the replacement heads cost.  </li>
            <li>and it does not wear out as fast.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>If you own the brush these are the larger head vs. the smaller head.  </li>
            <li>Standard heads, good quality, worked as expected.</li>
            <li>Replacement brushes fit base perfectly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally convenient - delivered right to you - and a better price than picking them up at a local store.</li>
            <li>Item came exactly as described, brand new, brand name brush heads, and at a much cheaper price than I could find in any nearby stores.</li>
            <li>These are clearly counterfeit!!!</li>
            <li>They have to be counterfeit because after only 2 uses, I experienced extreme bristle fraying (has never happened in my many years with sonicare products) and harsh vibrations.</li>
            <li>The replacement brushes are exactly like the one that came with the new handle.</li>
            <li>My teeth have never been, or felt cleaner except right after a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to go to a local store to find the genuine (older?)</li>
            <li>The brushes where extremely soft, too soft to actually clean your teeth</li>
            <li>The other B&amp;M stores in the area have it for a lot more.</li>
            <li>I love that you can change out the rings on the bottom for other colors, so you always know whose is whose.</li>
            <li>and I see from other user reviews now that many others have also been ripped off.  </li>
            <li>They are the same as the original heads that came with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Have not tried other kinds to compare, but do love this one.  </li>
            <li>These are factory sonicare brushes, so expect the same quality as you got with your original brush that came with the sonicare unit.</li>
            <li>I went with the Philips brand because I didn&#x27;t want to hassle with sub-par product (i.e. other reviewers say off-brand comes apart or doesn&#x27;t fit right, etc.).</li>
            <li>These are to big to get things clean and they are pricy.</li>
            <li>An electric toothbrush is only as helpful in keeping your teeth clean as the status of the brush head.</li>
            <li>and I am actively seeking a better solution.</li>
            <li>The FlexCare toothbrush is very slender and compact compared to the older Sonicare toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper and easier to use than the brush heads for the older model Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Although they are cheaper, if I had a choice I would have stayed with the older model if it had not broken.</li>
            <li>After brushing, my teeth feel exceptionally clean and I could never go back to a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Seem to last 4-6 months depending on how clean you like your mouth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the dark blue strip is a good indicator of when to change.  </li>
            <li>, I know that you are supposed to change heads regularly, but as long as they are still effective, I continue to use them, just seem to be going through these newer models, much faster than the older ones.</li>
            <li>These replacement heads are great in quality, but unfortunately they didn&#x27;t fit perfectly in my Sonic base.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS HIGH QUALITY AND ALSO FAST SHIPPING</li>
            <li>The brush heads are stiff enough to get a great clean, but soft enough to be gentle on the gums.</li>
            <li>(and, at my age my teeth are about the only thing that still works right!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy, but I&#x27;m afraid that my dentist is depressed, since a quick cleaning and checkup are all he gets to do to me.    </li>
            <li>Also had a hard time fitting this on to my Pro, but extra force did it and worked OK.  </li>
            <li>If you are careful with your brush heads, they should LAST WAY MORE than what the marker indicates!</li>
            <li>These are great for everyday use though Philips Sonicare have recently brought out sensitive toothbrush heads</li>
            <li>Overall, not a bad price for brush head replacements.</li>
            <li>The heads are loose and the bristles are extremely soft and get bent out of shape after 2 times of uses at most.</li>
            <li>Taking the heads off to clean the older ones was the main drawback and these are easier to clean and don&#x27;t get messy to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the sonic care, but when mine broke down after just one year, I had to re place it ASAP.  </li>
            <li>However, if I replaced brush heads as directed, I would have to buy a new 3-Pack every 3 months!</li>
            <li>The new brush was purchased a couple of years ago and replacing brush heads every 3-4 months really helps on the visits to the dentist office.</li>
            <li>Really needed new ones otherwise</li>
            <li>I will be buying new REAL tooth brush heads elsewhere from now on.</li>
            <li>I ended up getting new heads much sooner.</li>
            <li>With this design being slightly more compact than the previous version as well</li>
            <li>This pack I purchased has stray bristles that look like they have unfolded and make the brushing experience a bit less enjoyable.</li>
            <li>The brush heads became smaller, therefore less tooth surface is getting cleaned at a moment, and the bristles wear out more quickly.</li>
            <li>Previous ProResults toothbrush heads that I had bought lasted more than 3 months.  </li>
            <li>The Sonicare was a replacement for an older model that I had used for about 10 years.</li>
            <li>I prefer the Standard heads over the Compact heads as they are still relatively petite, but cover more tooth-surface and gum area when brushing.</li>
            <li>Also in terms of longevity, the philips system heads last longer, on the order of 4 months where some \\&quot;bargain brand\\&quot; heads are lucky at 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I could tell how stiffer they were compared to my older brush.</li>
            <li>This is a decent product for the system.</li>
            <li>Finally, these brush heads only work with Sonicare&#x27;s FlexCare series --  which is an amazingly light and manueverable brush handle, but that&#x27;s another review!</li>
            <li>These are smaller than most traditional toothbrush heads.  </li>
            <li>AND THIS IS EXACTLY THE SAME PRODUCT SOLD FOR A MUCH HIGHER PRICE ELSEWHERE.  </li>
            <li>This particular order&lt;br /&gt;was</li>
            <li>Since starting to use this particular &#x27;standard size&#x27; brush head I believe my teeth are being cleaned better than ever before.</li>
            <li>They work well, and hold up decently.  </li>
            <li>so if you have an older one, Amazon is the place to get replacements.</li>
            <li>Personally, my gums feel better after using this for this short time.      </li>
            <li>twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, based on my observations this particular added feature to the ProResults brush heads are inaccurate and would not recommend going by this to decide when it&#x27;s time to change heads.</li>
            <li>lead me to believe that these are clever knock-offs, not just representative of some drop in quality on Philips</li>
            <li>Only \\&quot;issue\\&quot; is that you will need to replace these heads more often than you would change a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>These replacement heads are the same as the one that came with it (I have a Healthy White model).  </li>
            <li>It is necessary to replace them regularly to make the most of the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Decent price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had very sensitive teeth and gums my whole life.</li>
            <li>I have purchased many items from Amazon and never been disappointed, also, I take advantage of free shipping with a $25.00 or more order.</li>
            <li>The color on the bristles lasts as long as the original that came with the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first because of price, but I can honestly say after using it for about a year, it was well worth it.</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly and was exactly what I ordered and expected.</li>
            <li>Anyway, it worked out fine, as they shipped quickly (free) and by airmail, and the brushes arrived on the 9th day following the order (including the Memorial Day weekend, not celebrated in England).</li>
            <li>The high speed vibrations knock the socks off plaque.</li>
            <li>The two drawbacks are (1) the high price of these brush heads and (2) the longevity of each brush head.</li>
            <li>When I buy these at the drugstore,I pay almost three times as much, I highly recommend this item for people who use sonicare replacement brushes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I would recommend the Sonicare highly.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it with the sanitizer.</li>
            <li>They hold up well, and they are high quality.</li>
            <li>the cost is so high, you might not want them.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying from this seller.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these Sonicare brush heads for your Sonicare system.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to any of my friends.</li>
            <li>the price of the heads is high.  </li>
            <li>They last a good while, I have found that they don&#x27;t last very long if you do the ultralight cleaning too often.</li>
            <li>I therefore use them a little longer than recommended though and make myself feel better about the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always ordered replacement heads thru Amazon, most of the time in the bulk package to save a little.  </li>
            <li>They are not cheap when compared to some other brushes, but how much is it worth to you to easily keep your teeth clean?</li>
            <li>When first using them they seemed to make an odd humming noise which the original heads did not make.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I am over 40, and still have all 32 original teeth, no crowns, bridges, root canals, or even a single pulled tooth.</li>
            <li>The bristles seem like they might be a little different shape than the original brush, but it works just fine.</li>
            <li>A cleaning tip would be to always remove the toothbrush head from the toothbrush itself, rinse it with some water, then let it sit on a clean paper towel to dry.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re much cheaper than brushheads for my old Sonicare Elite which ran about $40.00 for a pack of 3.</li>
            <li>The whole system is about couple hundred bucks, but the heads is nearly 30 buck?</li>
            <li>These things have a very loose fit.</li>
            <li>It cleans very well, but I did not notice marked whiteness in my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Great but expensive.  </li>
            <li>It couldn&#x27;t cost more than a few bucks to manufacture these in mass quantities.</li>
            <li>(it is pretty strange at first), I say keep with it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth spending the extra money and buying the quality ones in store.</li>
            <li>I think the extra frustration may not be worth the savings.</li>
            <li>The packing is quite convincing, but the brush heads are clearly a much lower quality than the ones I usually get.</li>
            <li>The only drawback on these is that they do not last that long - maybe a couple months at the very most.</li>
            <li>This replacement head works just the way it should, but it&#x27;s sure not cheap.  </li>
            <li>I always go to amazon for these things because of the added savings (no tax, free shipping, etc) and without the need to run down to my local big box store and pay 20% more for a product</li>
            <li>Other than that, the quality is fine.</li>
            <li>It works, so it&#x27;s fine but just not exactly the one I was hoping for</li>
            <li>They work just fine though other than that.</li>
            <li>You will be surprised how much of a difference a new brush head makes.</li>
            <li>I can really tell the difference between an old head and a new one.  </li>
            <li>Two minor nits: On/Off button is right where my thumb wants to go</li>
            <li>Finally got the right one.  </li>
            <li>The one I purchased at Philips store has serial number on the brush neck and these don&#x27;t; The brush is too firm; The blue color on the top of the brush is designed to fade as you use to remind you when you should change the brush, and these brushes don&#x27;t fade!</li>
            <li>I am not sure if hard is supposed to be more effective.</li>
            <li>They do not last as long as expected but do a good job before they wear out.  </li>
            <li>I heat going to a store to buy these because I live out in the country and it makes life easier to order them .  </li>
            <li>I ended up getting new brush heads at target.</li>
            <li>Purchased a set of replacement brush heads when I purchased a new Sonicare.</li>
            <li>This marker is just there so that Philips can make money out of you by replacing a FULLY FUNCTIONAL head with a new one.</li>
            <li>(I never installed them when I bought the toothbrush new at BJ&#x27;s wholesale, it came with 2 toothbrushes and charger bases).</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat the deal Amazon gives you when you sign up for the automatic shipment that delivers new brush heads every three months.  </li>
            <li>and I signed up to receive automatic shipments of new brushes &amp; this is so convenient.</li>
            <li>Maybe I could get a new one.</li>
            <li>I was told that no company extends their warranties or starts a new one based on a reoccurring problem.</li>
            <li>And with Amazon, we&#x27;re sent a new supply of brushes every three months without having to reorder.</li>
            <li>and it still performs as if brand new.  </li>
            <li>Bought these as replacements for my new Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li>have also tried the new Sonicare \\&quot;diamond\\&quot; brushes, and find I prefer these (the Proresults).</li>
            <li>and the new ones do not compare.</li>
            <li>They hold up well to the denture cleaner too, come out like new.</li>
            <li>Had to buy new Sonicare toothbrush so went with the newer model using these brush heads.  </li>
            <li>and I use it whenever I need new brush heads.</li>
            <li>Phillips recommends a new brush head every three months.  </li>
            <li>Has a wear indicator to change to a new brush head.</li>
            <li>I always bought new brush heads on amazon, because they are cheaper than in a drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love my sonic care toothbrush, but it is getting hard to find the brush heads at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>These brush heads arrived promptly and are exactly like what I would normally buy at my local bb&amp;b.  </li>
            <li>They not only didn&#x27;t fit properly on the device</li>
            <li>The brush head didn&#x27;t fit well, the brush head cover didn&#x27;t fit, and after two uses, the brush head looked worse than brush heads</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft, and the heads do not snap onto the brush.</li>
            <li>but they are very soft.</li>
            <li>The last ones I got wore out very fast, they may have been a knockoff.</li>
            <li>Not sure if amazon used a different supplier for my order, but I received a cheap knock-off that didn&#x27;t last for more than 1 day.</li>
            <li>Luckily, the second head is not slipping off the shank.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too much of a hassle to pull it off every week or so and clean, but it seems like the problem is a little bit deeper than that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had three or four Sonicares back to the really old fat ones that had a huge replacement head on them, then the series that had a slightly smaller head, and now the newest that uses these heads.  </li>
            <li>first Sonicare lasted 8 years.&lt;br /&gt;Now, to one which will last 2 years is a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is great for the lazy among us, because who remembers when you last changed it, and how long it has been.  </li>
            <li>-- the brush heads don&#x27;t click on to the toothbrush as the fitting is too small.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare toothbrushes for the last 5-6 years and this is the first and</li>
            <li>I just used it last night for the first time.  </li>
            <li>Target&#x27;s version lasts only a few days, then the fastening mechanism loses its grip, and the heads fly off during operation!</li>
            <li>After several weeks this brush became non-usable compared to the original brush that came with device (when I bought it) which I used for several months before it needed a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still, when compared to what my periodontist charges for a visit, this is a small price to pay, since the sonicare has virtually eliminated most of the \\&quot;pockets\\&quot; around my gumline.  </li>
            <li>and it did the exact same thing.  </li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li>This is the second time I&#x27;m submitting this review -- Amazon rejected the first one even though it met all of their guidelines.  </li>
            <li>I never realized how sub-par my standard toothbrush was until I bought my first Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I replace mine each time the light blue indicator bristles near the top of the brush head goes down, which is roughly once a month.</li>
            <li>Next time I will spend the extra money for the diamond clean ones...</li>
            <li>I used to get these Sonicare brush heads at Costco, but with the new items pushing out the old, they stopped carrying them.</li>
            <li>Why get a new model when the old one still works.</li>
            <li>Just pull off the old brush and push on the new one until it snaps</li>
            <li>I immediately opened the package, removed the old brush head and installed one of the new ones.</li>
            <li>Finally, after one-month&#x27;s use, the bristles on the first brush head look like the old ones did after the recommended three month use-cycle.  </li>
            <li>I then bought the next set of replacement brush heads from Target and the first head has lasted 2 months so far.  </li>
            <li>but I find that the blue strip of bristles fade to white pretty darn fast.</li>
            <li>These last a long time and are much better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>But since they actually shipped only two brushheads, the real per unit cost was much higher at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The bristles of the third brush head wore out so quickly so that I had to throw that one away too after only about a month (and no, I didn&#x27;t brush my teeth four times a day).  </li>
            <li>More over, after using it for one week, they&#x27;re in worse shape than the brush heads I&#x27;ve worn down for many months.</li>
            <li>These brush heads dont fit (to tight)</li>
            <li>Original brushhead that came with the toothbrush lasted a long time, but finally figured I should replace it.</li>
            <li>Not nearly the same quality as the original brushhead.</li>
            <li>We will continue using the two brushes but already I can see the brushes are not going to last as long as the the original brushes lasted.</li>
            <li>They are loose (and consequently vibrate too much) and eventually these loosened up so much that the heads vibrated off of the handle and into my mouth.  </li>
            <li>but the little rings that come with the heads don&#x27;t fit well, but don&#x27;t affect the function</li>
            <li>These were in the same packaging, but the fit is loose and the quality nowhere near the official brush heads.</li>
            <li>they are not quite as large as the old toothbrush heads for my former sonicare toothbrush..</li>
            <li>A little expensive for toothbrush heads but works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>The packaging looked brand legitimate although different from the past ones - narrower vertical packaging of two on top and one at bottom, as to 3 side-by-side older packaging.</li>
            <li>I can confirm what many other have said about these brush heads - they are definitely not the same heads that came with the brush when I bought it new.  </li>
            <li>I went and bought a 5-pack replacement set from a local store, and the difference is clear: the ones that I ordered from Amazon just can&#x27;t be the real deal.</li>
            <li>These were very brittle and did not last for even a month.</li>
            <li>They are not made very well, especially for the cost!</li>
            <li>and I do not think they are too soft.</li>
            <li>I prefer soft toothbrush.</li>
            <li>When Sam&#x27;s club quit carrying the refills for my Sonicare brush heads ,I was pleasantly surprised to find them on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>The price is so much lower than the $40 per pack I paid recently at a drug store.  </li>
            <li>and it works, just like the old one.  </li>
            <li>What it does lack is instructions for removing the old brush.  </li>
            <li>so naturally one is reluctant to \\&quot;force the issue\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner than when I was using just a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel like I just had a professional teeth cleaning &amp; it seems to be helping tighten the gaps along my gumline.</li>
            <li>Now my teeth and gums are no longer sensitive.</li>
            <li>Not sure if this is a knockoff of the real thing because the packaging looks exactly like the real ones</li>
            <li>However, they haven&#x27;t so far.  </li>
            <li>They also make about three times the noise of the old ones.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are so soft I cannot use them.</li>
            <li>Brushes were too soft and started fraying within a week.</li>
            <li>Very upset with this purchase, they are going back, used or not.</li>
            <li>Do you think the UV rays may be causing the blue indicator strip to fade away that much faster?</li>
            <li>Out of the 3 heads in the pack, 2 of them made this noise and were quite loud.       </li>
            <li>(thank you to those who mentioned it), but at least I&#x27;ll know that they&#x27;re authentic.</li>
            <li>When compared to genuine brush heads a nub of plastic is missing from the interior which prevents it from locking in place.</li>
            <li>I would definitely like a refund or to exchange for the real thing.</li>
            <li>My second purchase - not so much.</li>
            <li>These brush heads are way too soft to be sonicare.</li>
            <li>I am going back to Subscribe and Save of the real thing.</li>
            <li>Much prefer the Intercare, which last 4 months.</li>
            <li>Amazon was very cooperative in accepting them back.</li>
            <li>When our old Sonicare toothbrush died (it lasted over 3 years)</li>
            <li>They have not lasted nearly as well as others I have bought for the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Since I started using this brush the problem is completely reversed.  </li>
            <li>The bristles were extremely soft and ineffective</li>
            <li>the bristles were completely bent over and useless&lt;</li>
            <li>I revert to my manual toothbrush when the bristles go too soft.</li>
            <li>(I put my old brush head on, and it worked</li>
            <li>Just 5 days later, I had to change the brush head because the bristles became VERY frayed.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are so soft, they feel like they are over 3 months old already.</li>
            <li>As soon as I replaced the old head, my mouth/teeth felt 100% &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; again with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Also, with subscribe and save the packaging is far easier to open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought real Sonicare tooth brush heads to compare to these fakes and they are completely different.</li>
            <li>so I gave 2 stars, just surprised these came from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Do your teeth and gums a favor with floss, soft picks, and Sonicare brushes.</li>
            <li>It makes me use them far longer than I probably should</li>
            <li>Sonicare is a good system but the brush head 3 pack is $10 too expensive.</li>
            <li>It actually does make your teeth a little whiter and leaves a very clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sad because i love my toothbrush but need to find the right bristles for it.</li>
            <li>I like the toothbrush (not better than my rotadent), but the order came quickly, and the brush heads were in the correct packaging for a much cheaper price than in the store.</li>
            <li>there is a little bump that is not on the original ones.</li>
            <li>Bristles are VERY soft, not like the normal Standard bristles i&#x27;ve been using for two years.</li>
            <li>As well,  bristles look completely aged prematurely after just 1 1/2 months unlike the original brush heads which last about in excess of &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;</li>
            <li>anyways, they clean the same and last the same.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because these are so powerful (used with the Sonicare system), thereby desensitizing me or some other reason.</li>
            <li>Just what we wanted, the same thing but new!  </li>
            <li>However, you&#x27;ve taken the plunge, so you may as well buy them as cheaply as possible, right here at the digital general store.</li>
            <li>The ProResults label also looks odd, crooked, some letters are in different size, done in what most resembles shimmer nail polish and already half-peeled off.</li>
            <li>Heads for my older style brush with larger diameter handle (ni-cad battery powered) lasted 4+ months.</li>
            <li>But after the first few times, they start going on much easier.</li>
            <li>These brush heads seem to last longer/perform better than with past electric brushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>recall my older model, the brush heads seemed to last a lot longer</li>
            <li>The head fits tight and ultrasonic vibration transmits through head adequately</li>
            <li>I do no floss as much as I should, so this goes a long way in helping to mitigate the effects of neglect.</li>
            <li>My brushes arrived with normal Sonicare packaging and are obviously legit.</li>
            <li>As for these replacement brushes, they&#x27;re exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that the blue use indicator seemed to run down faster than the original heads.  </li>
            <li>If the standard head (like a regular toothbrush) fits a normal sized, adult mouth, it seems that you&#x27;re gaining about twice the amount of cleaning action over</li>
            <li>I was so excited to be ordering more online with Amazon Prime, but when I got them it was such a disappointment.</li>
            <li>And the feature where the bristles change color when it&#x27;s time for a new brush head, is a definite plus.</li>
            <li>With the new model, I may take it next time.</li>
            <li>Simply pull off your used brush and pop a new one in its place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased Philips replacement heads where I used to get them, at a nearby big-box store and after several weeks of use, they still appear nearly new.  </li>
            <li>I just changed my brush for the second time since I got my new Flexcare toothbrush about five months ago.</li>
            <li>My whole family after using this for a few weeks, the whole family likes the way the brush cleans.  </li>
            <li>but since they can fit my handle and they are not total wastes of money, 2 stars.</li>
            <li>I now regret I haven&#x27;t made a picture of both the used brush and the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;After using all 3 in an unusual short period of time I bought another pack from a local brick and mortar store - and THOSE are like the brushes I used to have.</li>
            <li>Philips Sonicare HX6013 ProResults Brush Head Standard, 3-Pack is once again a good buy although too expensive.</li>
            <li>In just few days the brush became to deteriorate - curling in all directions and quickly became unusable.</li>
            <li>I got this after my very old Sonicare finally kicked the bucket.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been perfectly content going through about one head every quarter, which at ~$20-30/year isn&#x27;t bad!</li>
            <li>I had purchased these through Amazon once in the past from this seller and was pleased, but the second time I did it was a completely different experience.  </li>
            <li>Had no other choice but to use this inferior knock off.  </li>
            <li>(I brush 2-4 times a day) but they keep my teeth extremely white and clean in comparison to any other standard toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I was able to order at half the price and with the automatic reorder I requested, I don&#x27;t have to worry about reordering when mine are wore down.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not much to say about these brush heads other than they are genuine Phillips parts</li>
            <li>I hope we can find a source for decent ones, otherwise it will be back to a regular tooth brush.</li>
            <li>However, by the beginning of the third week I noticed that the bristles were already wearing down, and towards the end of the third week the bristles showed significant signs of wear.</li>
            <li>They are the right ones for my handle but one of them did not stay on the handle and the other 2 flattened out in only 2 days each making them unusable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They are a little pointed at the tip, which is great for getting behind the back molars.  </li>
            <li>dentist told me that generally speaking, he sees a 30% improvement in gum health for people who purchase this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Everyone&#x27;s mileage will vary with these heads, but I generally get 2-3 months out of one before I have to replace it.</li>
            <li>I floss generally 3 times a week, instead of nightly.....</li>
            <li>They last a long time and seem to do the job very well.</li>
            <li>Amazon and its sellers need to stop selling the counterfeits after so many people have complained for so long.  </li>
            <li>This is my second Sonicare in fifteen years, and it has improved considerably.  </li>
            <li>The Sonicare ProResults brush heads improve on the old design by having a simple joint to connect it to the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Further, these are completely sealed units; so, they don&#x27;t trap liquid inside like the Advance and probably the Elite.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t brush back and forth like your old brush, let the machine do the work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Finally though I broke the friggin thing trying to get the old brush off.</li>
            <li>Able to have this auto shipped at a regular interval at least $10 cheaper than I can buy this 3 pack anywhere locally</li>
            <li>There is no way these things will last three months, I&#x27;ll be surprised to get another week out of them.</li>
            <li>You absolutely will not regret the money spent on this (any Sonicare) brush.</li>
            <li>However daily use causes the heads to fray and get too soft.  </li>
            <li>Actually, we never really learned much about toothbrushing in dental school.</li>
            <li>and I use one instead of flossing, works just as well apparently.</li>
            <li>The third one completely well off every time I turned my toothbrush on.</li>
            <li>and it took forever to get the cookie out of my natural dips in my back teeth.</li>
            <li>So far I have only used one of the three heads.  </li>
            <li>So all is well as long as it is not a common problem</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not experienced any more brush pieces lodged in my mouth.</li>
            <li>Not bad, but not outstanding.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, if preferring a compact head and having a normal sized, adult mouth, you may want to compensate for less brushing action by increasing brushing time.</li>
            <li>I left on my trip mid September, 2010 with a new Flexcare.</li>
            <li>So only one of us gets the 3rd new one.  </li>
            <li>At less than ten dollars each, they are well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Got them a few weeks ago, using one of them right now</li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 4 star rating is based on the short life of the head, but they do a fantastic job of cleaning when they are in proper working condition, and there is no better feeling on your teeth, unless you are just walking out of the dentists office, for me, there is no  other brand.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve had three brushes wear out in less than 10 weeks.</li>
            <li>In the past, I&#x27;ve used the same Sonicare brush head for 6 months without a significant reduction in the brush&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
            <li>I have used the ProResults brush heads for the past 18 months and they seem to do a better job than any of the other brush heads I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>After a week of use, the first head came apart, so I pushed it back together and use it very carefully.</li>
            <li>I have found that these brush heads do not last as long as the older e-series brushes.  </li>
            <li>I have used other electric toothbrushes which I do not like as much as Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping and everything expected when I bought this product!</li>
            <li>It is also much cheaper then the other stores that were selling it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only a month into the new brush head and it already went from blue to white indicating it&#x27;s time to replace it.</li>
            <li>The brushes fizzled out right away, the plastic cap barely fits on to the head, and you can easily pull the neck off from the base when trying to remove the whole brush.</li>
            <li>BTW, I gave away a brand new Oral-B spinbrush-style brush because the brushheads were uncomfortably large, so I&#x27;m not kidding about the small mouth.  </li>
            <li>I noticed some people complained that these were cheap imitations of actual Sonicare toothbrushes, but I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>The only downside is Amazon only offers every 6 month</li>
            <li>After only one week of use, these were completely frayed and all the blue color was gone.</li>
            <li>They shorten the bristles that makes it more difficult to brush my teeth, but they say &amp;#34;contoured pattern fits the natural shape of your teeth&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I have owned a sonicare toothbrush for the last 10 years, having recently bought the flexcare, since my old sonicare was plugged into 220, and died.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I changed to a different supplier (still on Amazon) thinking the old supplier had counterfeit products, and had the same problem.</li>
            <li>I have used sonicare toothbrushes on the advice of my periodontist, the electric toothbrush makes it easy to brush all areas, however, the brush heads are not heavy duty like my old manual toothbrush, they require periodic replacement, a bit expensive at around $10 a pop.  </li>
            <li>I have had no problem with these, but I think the price is too high because they don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>They come exactly on time and it makes my life a little easier not having to think about it.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m stuck without any brushes since my next subscription installment is not due until Jan</li>
            <li>changing to the new ones makes a big difference when you use one too long.</li>
            <li>Previously, I had the small head brushes, but these are much better for me.</li>
            <li>The price paid for this was far less than I would normally pay in a retail box store.</li>
            <li>Great :-(</li>
            <li>Make sure the toothbrush heads are compatable with your actual toothbrush and your cant go far wrong.</li>
            <li>but they do not fit exactly.  </li>
            <li>I like switching out the standard head for the compact head to better reach behind the teeth and in the back molars.</li>
            <li>While the price is about $2 less than walmart, the fit of these toothbrush heads is slightly off</li>
            <li>They were so frayed the whole brush head was compacted down and looked almost melted.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush heads get a bit pricey, especially since my husband and I both use them and they really do need to be replaced every three months (instead of every six, like conventional toothbrushes).</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fit down snug over the little metal nub on my Sonicare</li>
            <li>I mean I would much rather use my older brush head than use these.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s supposed to be the right pone but seems small.</li>
            <li>I agree with the other reviewers that say the price seems high for this tooth brush.</li>
            <li>they are soft as not to irritate your gums and they last a long time.  </li>
            <li>Replacement heads are very expensive in the stores, but more reasonable on Amazon.   </li>
            <li>The bristles  break down very soon after starting to use them.</li>
            <li>Had these less than month, and already the first replacement is flat, lost it&#x27;s shape, now moving on to the next one.</li>
            <li>Brushes fit base very snugly and offer a crisp brush of the teeth.  </li>
            <li>I like these small ones so much better than those lunky big ones from a few years ago.</li>
            <li>The original brushes lasted for a solid 6 months, These bristles have flattened out in less than half that time.</li>
            <li>It is something that is known going into buying the Sonicare package but pretty depressing when you spend over 100 for the original package.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t seem any more &#x27;complex&#x27; than a standard toothbrush which costs an order of magnitude less.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon, I can get these heads just a little bit cheaper than at Walmart or Target.</li>
            <li>These brush heads are specified for my new Sonicare Flexcare RS980 Toothbrush but also work on some other models.  </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m out of the purchase fee and three new brush heads due to this purchase.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Absolutely love them!</li>
            <li> Love my Sonicare brush and these replacement heads!</li>
            <li> First off, Sonicare makes the best toothbrushes around.</li>
            <li> After many years of purchasing those brushheads, I thought I&#x27;d died and gone to heaven when I saw the price for these brushheads!</li>
            <li> I love them!</li>
            <li> I took a chance with these and am pleased!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased the sonicare electric brush, I love it!</li>
            <li> Now I am sure to replace them every three months!</li>
            <li> Guess I should have paid more attention to the seller&#x27;s name as they can&#x27;t even spell &amp;#34;BUY&amp;#34; correctly!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t exactly need 3 of these at once, but it&#x27;s the best option.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare!</li>
            <li> I have used them for many years!</li>
            <li> Works great, easy to change.</li>
            <li> Great product and easy to find in Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Great product, can easily match with my Electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> If this is anything like the original brush head that came with the Sonicare system, these will work beautifully.</li>
            <li> I think that the brushes do a great job on keeping my teeth clean and it is very easy to use and the brushes have a good wear indicator on them.  </li>
            <li> Sonicare makes an amazing electric toothbrush...</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare ProResults Brush Heads are amazing.  </li>
            <li> Great product, hassle free ordering.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush is amazing</li>
            <li> They work great and fit the handle like a glove.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> Sonicare toothbrushes are amazing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, because I liked the Elite too.    </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re buying replacement brush heads for a toothbrush you already own, why are you even reading these reviews?</li>
            <li> Nice value for the price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t own an Elite, but it looks like it could also trap liquid and toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> and it cleans my teeth up nicely.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t own a Sonicare system, look into it.  </li>
            <li> They work great and provide the best brush I&#x27;ve ever had, especially as compared to a manual brush.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the price and fast delivery for the brush heads for my sonic electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> nice price, 2 day Amazon prime delivery ...</li>
            <li> Six packs for a cheaper price would be nice.</li>
            <li> Now that&#x27;s a nice trend.</li>
            <li> Thanks again for your excellent response.</li>
            <li> However, since I gladly pay for it and believe that it provides superior cleaning of my teeth</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, while the design of these heads and the toothbrush is nice, it does require continual removal and cleaning.</li>
            <li> It is a nice backup in places where you have no signal, but if it disagrees with your smartphone, just disregard its instructions.</li>
            <li> Sonicare has proven to be effective in promoting tooth/gum care.</li>
            <li> kind of pricey....</li>
            <li> Thank you, kindly.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, excellent product!</li>
            <li> They fit the brush perfectly, unlike many of the &#x27;knock-off&#x27; brands available !....</li>
            <li> I fond these to be good brush heads, better then the compact ones, you have to own a phillips sonic electric tooth brush to make use of these brush heads.</li>
            <li> Love my sonicare toothbruh and these toothbrush heads are awesome and are priced right on Amazon.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s excited to brush his teeth, and I&#x27;m happy with the results on my own teeth.  </li>
            <li> THIS IS A GOOD ORIGINAL REPLACEMENT THAT WORKS VERU GOOD.</li>
            <li> These work great, just like what came with my toothbrush originally.  </li>
            <li> Great replacements to my original brush.</li>
            <li> and it is 100% worth its cost!!!  </li>
            <li> These are great to keep you teeth clean.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome toothbrush that came highly recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare brush is of high quality and with the ease of reordering brush heads through Amazon, I am happy!</li>
            <li> I forgot why I moved away from these heads, and loved the &#x27;diamond clean&#x27; head as soon as I tried it!  </li>
            <li> Either the manufacturer created defective latest batch or they are very convincing fakes.</li>
            <li> It gets my teeth cleaner than I can clean them with a manual brush, and it is both very effective and easier on my gums.</li>
            <li> These brushes are perfect for the new Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> thought maybe this is a newer version of heads or something, but I bought new heads from Duane Reade again, and they work perfectly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;What&#x27;s most important, you&#x27;ll get a GREAT cleaning every time.  </li>
            <li> and they are priced really good and ship very quick.</li>
            <li> We can&#x27;t say enough good things about how awesome these or the toothbrush itself</li>
            <li> We received them quickly and were happy with the service.</li>
            <li> These brushes fall off the handle very easily.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Pretty good buy after all!  </li>
            <li> They work fine and are a good price.</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;ve purchased the best - you should buy the original replacements to go with it instead of generics (I tried them and it wasn&#x27;t worth it).  </li>
            <li> so was delighted to see that they were available on line.  </li>
            <li> The genuine HX6013 Philips Proresults Brush Heads are a good choice.  </li>
            <li> the Sonicare ProResults is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Found this 3-pack, which is about 1/2 the price at big box stores (I know, I&#x27;ve bought a 3pack there too...), and it is an excellent price, shipped fast, and works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> It is nice to be able to order them and not have to go out to buy them.</li>
            <li> Top notch heads, cheaper then anywhere else, and you own the Philips Sonicare system already.</li>
            <li> It is supposed to be even more effective.</li>
            <li> These obviously are designed for the Phiilips Toothbrush, the excellent toothbrush by Phillips, who produce the toothbrush that is like having your own Dental Hygienist in your bathroom.</li>
            <li> I love electric toothbrush, and Phillips has the best so far.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t get a good clean.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and we both love it.</li>
            <li> The seller was great, very fast in getting it shipped.</li>
            <li> Finding replacement heads at a very reasonable cost is great.  </li>
            <li> These are the exact brand brush heads and are a great deal.  </li>
            <li> We have used these  toothbrushes very successfully for years because we thought all these kind of toothbrushes work the same.</li>
            <li> Great product and so much cheaper than the market or Costco!  </li>
            <li> The exact product I was looking for at a great price.</li>
            <li> ,it was the original and perfect ,thanks</li>
            <li> The refills do exactly what they are supposed to:  provide replacement for the Sonicare brush, which is itself a great tool.</li>
            <li> Great product and consistent quality.</li>
            <li> Great for the whole family!</li>
            <li> I should have know that these brush heads were too good to be true considering their price.  </li>
            <li> The price is quite good for the true Philips brand.  </li>
            <li> these work just fine!</li>
            <li> Far superior to manual tooth brush, this product is very effective in maintaining healthy teeth.</li>
            <li> Good buy and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Clearly many people seem to be happy with this product if you check the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Do not buy these cheap knock-offs!</li>
            <li> Authentic replacement heads do not perform this way.  </li>
            <li> They have way better quality then these.</li>
            <li> We phoned Sonicare and they sent us two more.</li>
            <li> Is it any better than the Elite?  </li>
            <li> I love these Sonicare brushes and they work well</li>
            <li> Better check with Walmart.  </li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> ons are better.</li>
            <li> My wife use the same brush heads and very happy with the result.</li>
            <li> Arrived early &amp; fit perfectly!</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using this product and would buy it again.  </li>
            <li> As much as I love my Sonicare toothbrush when these heads run out I will replace the toothbrush...not the heads.</li>
            <li> but I love it.   </li>
            <li> Philips have come up with a solid product here, but remember to replace the brush heads every three months to keep it working its best.  </li>
            <li> These are perfect refill brush-heads (Standard) for the Philips Sonicare FlexCare.</li>
            <li> I feel like they do a better job of cleaning my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> This is a great refill pack for the Sonicare toothbrush and much cheaper then buying it in a store.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely better than the oral B.</li>
            <li> I have had this sonic toothbrush forever and really like it, the heads work great</li>
            <li> Also, it was definitely the best price I found with my online search--I didn&#x27;t have to pay postage.  </li>
            <li> We love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a standard item that you can find anywhere, but I found the best price here.</li>
            <li> If you price power toothbrush heads, sonicare floats to the top everywhere among brands.  </li>
            <li> Best price anywhere that I could find, I \\&quot;subscribed\\&quot; since this is an item that needs renewing every now and then, and ended up saving 40% off regular store prices!</li>
            <li> and my teeth are healthy as ever.</li>
            <li> Love the sonicare toothbrush system.  </li>
            <li> 6023 maybe better for guns.</li>
            <li> 6013 covers more of teeth area.</li>
            <li> brushes work well and through a combination of better care and using this toothbrush, I&#x27;ve had better visits with my dentist and hygenist.</li>
            <li> I love sonicare.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with receiving my Sonicare Brush Head in the mail.</li>
            <li> These heads are a lot better than the off brand heads.</li>
            <li> If you get on the subscriber program, the price is better than what you would pay anywhere else.</li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> I just purchased the toothbrush about 2 months ago and absolutely love its&#x27; features.</li>
            <li> so I thought the cost of replacement brushheads would be more than the $40.00 I used to pay for those for the Sonicare Elite.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I ordered the correct refills</li>
            <li> I love the Sonicare Flexcare</li>
            <li> just what i was needing. :)</li>
            <li> Now that my 9yo has braces, I bought these to make sure he brushes well.  </li>
            <li> , they replacement heads, originals, they work, I love the tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> I waited longer than I should have and after installed and found teeth cleaning was better and faster.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hesistant to buy any more brush heads from Amazon.</li>
            <li> and I have to say that the standard brush head is the best.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of being able to have these when I need them</li>
            <li> I love saving money.</li>
            <li> I love my sonic care system.</li>
            <li> My teeth are healthy.</li>
            <li> To the product, these brush heads are much more hygienic than the precious brush head design.</li>
            <li> and I feel it fits much better in the mouth.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> HE WILL  LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush, and it means that I need to use the replacement all the time.</li>
            <li> The product is top quality.</li>
            <li> In my wife&#x27;s case I lost the battle, but my kids love the system now and, like me, they couldn&#x27;t do without</li>
            <li> And when it comes to the replacement heads, (which they recommend changing every three months or so) put them on a Subscribe &amp; Save schedule, and you&#x27;ll save even more.  </li>
            <li> I love that it can be put into the dishwasher to be washed as needed.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> If I was stranded on a desert island I&#x27;d need a power source and my sonicare! :)</li>
            <li> Love these brushes..</li>
            <li> it costs more.</li>
            <li> I just wish the price was more in line with the cost of producing these.  </li>
            <li> I probably get only 2 months use at best before the &#x27;reminder bristles&#x27; fade to the point where Sonicare recommends replacement.</li>
            <li> The price here at Amazon is much better than what I&#x27;ve been able to find in stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love my Philips toothbrush.</li>
            <li> and I noticed a difference:)</li>
            <li> The product arrived in only two days in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Still love my Sonicare</li>
            <li> The more I use it the more I like it.</li>
            <li> but it does not allow me to click the appropriate button.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommend if you want to get the most out of your Sonicare.</li>
            <li> and I have purchased many before.</li>
            <li> So glad to have found them on this site.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush system.</li>
            <li> I love that it can be put into the dishwasher to be washed as needed.  </li>
            <li> So many toothbrushes now on the market</li>
            <li> I love the package of three - now I don&#x27;t need to order again for a while.</li>
            <li> I get that the brush and vibrations are supposed to do most of the work</li>
            <li> Love my Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Love the sonicare brush.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I like this size so much better than the compact heads.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I love these kinds of toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Glad they changed the style...</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> OK, the package looks identical to the one that I purchased from a grocery store.</li>
            <li> These were much better priced than at my local store and they work perfectly in my Sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love brushing with Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Love sonicare, they take all the guesswork out of brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think these are authentic ProResult brush.</li>
            <li> Softer, more reach; can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> My bottom teeth continued to feel \\&quot;gritty\\&quot; no longer how many times I went over them with the brush.</li>
            <li> I am happy to find them reasonably priced through your website.</li>
            <li> It truly makes you confident all around.</li>
            <li> My dental exams/cleanings have been much better since I started using this product.  </li>
            <li> and I am pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> Free shipping!</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;ll have to pay even more money ordering from Bed Bath and Beyond</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare toothbrushes for over a decade, and I love them.</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought the electric toothbrush and the replacements.</li>
            <li> Overall excellent price for these.</li>
            <li> :) Supply and demand works every time.</li>
            <li> Im glad I was able to get three replacements for the price of one</li>
            <li> The price could have been better.</li>
            <li> Could be the name accounts for most of it.</li>
            <li> the option for smaller/larger heads as well, and Amazon definitely has the best price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like that it is more sleek and trim than my wife&#x27;s e-Series.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare, but the heads are way too pricey.  </li>
            <li> love the color strands that indicate when it is time to replace.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Continue to use these with the electric toothbrush &amp; my dentist is pleased @</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Sonicare toothbrush for years and love it.  </li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare ProResults HX6013 Brush Head Standard 3pk is the best dental product I ever used for dental hygine.</li>
            <li> Most people probably wouldn&#x27;t notice anything though - and perhaps it&#x27;s just my imagination...</li>
            <li> I might add contained 6 bushes and each one lasted for 6 months or more.</li>
            <li> Simply the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> bought these because they were the cheapest but not too sure what happened.</li>
            <li> i like being able to purchase the replacement heads online.  </li>
            <li> but its sure better than the dentist</li>
            <li> Never used an electronic brush till now, but I love it.</li>
            <li> What do you buy as a stocking stuffer when your kid&#x27;s top Christmas wish list item is an electric toothbrush?</li>
            <li> Love it, no complains.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are wonderful and last longer than three months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Phillips Sonicare for over 2 years and have gone through many brush head replacements.  </li>
            <li> These brush heads lasted at most 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> One of the better prices around.</li>
            <li> so they could come up with something better now?  </li>
            <li> The Sonicare tooth brush is a tremendous asset because these brushes clean so well and leave your mouth feeling great.  </li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> You would pay so much more if you purchased them at a retail store.</li>
            <li> so I know they will be authentic Philips brand brush</li>
            <li> Love the electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are my favorite brush heads for the Sonicare line of toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I let them keep the head :)</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s faster, more efficient, gets everywhere</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still able to use them though.</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> These heads rattle on the toothbrush more than the $16 knockoffs I bought on Groupon.</li>
            <li> I do not have much more to say about it than that.</li>
            <li> Work well and fit our electric brush nicely.</li>
            <li> and they are even better than these.</li>
            <li> So much better than the E series ones with that cap like brushes that get moldy underneath.</li>
            <li> We love our Sonicare tooth brush products.  </li>
            <li> The electric toothbrush does a much better job on my teeth than manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> but i like using the sonicare better than manual brush.</li>
            <li> These are authentic Philips brush heads</li>
            <li> I love the level of cleaning I get when I brush with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> They were really cheaply made!</li>
            <li> Love my sonicare toothbrush needed more heads and will be buying more when it is time to refill, every time.</li>
            <li> I love this brand and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re tooth brushes, what more van I say.</li>
            <li> Love Sonicare products.</li>
            <li> Now I see that there is a banner ad at the top of my Amazon page at the moment -- paid for by Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> My hygienist also likes how much better my teeth are, during cleaning appointments,&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Could be the brush I have, has many cycles, and I brush longer than 2 minutes</li>
            <li> Nothing is better.</li>
            <li> This was the most convenient and cheapest method of purchase.</li>
            <li> Much better cleaning than a manual toothbrush</li>
            <li> to a more reliable seller than this one.</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> I use these more than the HS6023 compact brush.</li>
            <li> Received promptly, they are as described, packed okay.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean I am so pleased!</li>
            <li> It was a good deal and easier than going out looking for the right</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I am not as good remembering to replace at the right time inbetween the shipments.</li>
            <li> Amazon is very competent and the Phillips Sonicare toothbrush was sent quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li> Keeps my teeth nice and clean</li>
            <li> They fit over my Sonicare tooth brush very easily.</li>
            <li> All Sonic care products are great quality Philips products and I recommend them highly.</li>
            <li> Would strongly recommend purchasing from a reputable retailer where you can be sure of their provenance.</li>
            <li> With free super saver shipping, these are a good price for the &#x27;consumable&#x27; part, and it&#x27;s a convenient way to get them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and does a much better job than the manual toothbrushes used for so many years.</li>
            <li> They make my teeth feel VERY clean.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare electric tooth brushes are pretty good and do make a difference for me.  </li>
            <li> Nevertheless, for the first two weeks the brush did a fairly good job cleaning my teeth</li>
            <li> Look if you have the Philips Sonicare, you need these brushes, and I might add they are pretty good and leave you feeling</li>
            <li> This new brush is great.</li>
            <li> we replaced it with a new one and was happy to see that we could get the replacement brushes from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> These fit great, and the real Phillips brand, and this price cannot be beat.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d have an easy time finding and buying the replacement heads</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicares for years and they are simply the best toothbrushes available.    </li>
            <li> My boyfriend use Philips sonicare for several months, he said it is very excellent on his tooth and also this brush head is fit on the philips sonicare.</li>
            <li> I love using the Sonicare, and the brushes are just fine, but why do replacement heads cost $6 each?</li>
            <li> My teeth have never look so clean!</li>
            <li> Love the sonicare system and these replacements work just fine.  </li>
            <li> and I cannot believe how clean my teeth feel!</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t believe how clean my mouth and teeth feel all the time!</li>
            <li> Actually, these are very good.  </li>
            <li> Overall, a very good product.</li>
            <li> however it&#x27;s better than having to get cavities filled and plaque scraped off your teeth by the dentist</li>
            <li> I enjoy that i don&#x27;t have to worry about making sure i have replacement brush head.</li>
            <li> I am 82 years old and my dentist consistently praises&lt;br /&gt;me on my excellent teeth.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive gums and these are great.</li>
            <li> I love our Sonicare toothbrush and these heads fit it.  </li>
            <li> These work great on my old sonicare body.</li>
            <li> Almost as soon as my wife and I put these on our toothbrushes, the bristles started to fray (some even pulled out) and began becoming compressed.  </li>
            <li> And I will save my wrath for something more important.</li>
            <li> Would be great for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> It is important to have good oral health for good overall health.  </li>
            <li> It holds a good charge and the fact that you cradle it each time, it&#x27;s always ready.</li>
            <li> The service is fast - I love being able to have it on auto order every three months!  </li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted for my Sonicare, it came to me fast, and and it was a good price!</li>
            <li> The packaging was sealed and in good shape, and the product itself is exactly like the original that came with my toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I have bought before, but Amazon had the best price then any other place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more familiar with, as these will get trashed.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare ProResults brush heads are great, and a huge improvement over the old design.</li>
            <li> It effectibely removes all plaque and is compact and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Well, it does.. feel more clean.</li>
            <li> They are durable and they clean your teeth way better than brushing manually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is easy to clip on to the sonicare brush.  </li>
            <li> Compact and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Very quick service</li>
            <li> My brush heads easily fell off while brushing.</li>
            <li> which is supposed to clean even better.  </li>
            <li> They are easy to install.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are easy to pop on or off for sharing the handle with others.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel nice and clean after brushing and these heads to not wear out particularly quickly.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, they fit my Flexcare.</li>
            <li> These heads leave a gap between them and the handle of the toothbrush where toothpaste residue can easily accumulate.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads are easy to find at Amazon at a cheaper price than what we have here on Guam...</li>
            <li> I think I like the Diamond Clean heads better.  </li>
            <li> Shipped very quickly</li>
            <li> No matter how many times I brush with a manual brush, I cannot achieve the clean feeling I get after using a Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Easy to replace.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to forget to replace them as often as one should.</li>
            <li> Easy on and easy off.</li>
            <li> This order shipped quickly, the products were packaged wonderfully, thus making the entire experience fabulous.</li>
            <li> Have to say that they have made it easy to order online though.</li>
            <li> Heads just snap on and are easy to change.</li>
            <li> These are copies of the OEM and it&#x27;s easy to tell.</li>
            <li> So easy, it&#x27;s a pleasure to brush.</li>
            <li> I have been reading in the reviews about how these lose bristles and flatten out very quickly.</li>
            <li> They flatten out very quickly and become ineffective between the teeth.</li>
            <li> That is an EXCELLENT toothbrush, and in the nearly 3 years I have been using it, my teeth have been MUCH healthier.</li>
            <li> I strongly recomended it</li>
            <li> I own the Philips Sonicare that calls for these replacements which my husband and I like very much.  </li>
            <li> High quality at a good price.</li>
            <li> If you expect it to do anything more special, it wont.</li>
            <li> you are looking at these heads, then you more than likely already own the Sonicare system and already know how amazing the system is.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the fast service from Amazon.</li>
            <li> The best way to drive the price down on this product is to not buy it.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a long shot in getting it to fit my toothbrush, but luckily they fir perfectly</li>
            <li> This is the third Philips Sonicare toothbrush I have purchased, the first through AMAZON,  and I find it excellent.</li>
            <li> They worked fine but these Proresult snap</li>
            <li> These are replacement brush heads for the fine Philips Sonicare tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> They do their job just fine.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush heads work fine.  </li>
            <li> size is fine for his mouth.  </li>
            <li> They worked fine.</li>
            <li> It brushes fine.</li>
            <li> These replacement brushes securely and easily attach to the unit.</li>
            <li> I was fine</li>
            <li> I have ordered Phillips Sonicare replacement brushheads off of Amazon before and they have been fine.</li>
            <li> so it appears that the toothbrush is still fine.</li>
            <li> Delivery went fine.</li>
            <li> These work just fine on my Sonicare brush</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a toothbrush head and works just fine.  </li>
            <li> Its fine.</li>
            <li> Product is fine.</li>
            <li> I received another set and they work fine.  </li>
            <li> Fine product.</li>
            <li> they cost less on here and work great!</li>
            <li> These are OEM replacements so work just fine.</li>
            <li> I should say the brushes themselves were fine, otherwise.</li>
            <li> Amazon pricing is better than I have found elsewhere and delivery is quick.</li>
            <li> The price is cheaper than the store, get them quick, and they are perfect-what more can I ask for?</li>
            <li> They wear out WAY TOO QUICKLY!</li>
            <li> Its amazing how much better your sonic brushing is with a new head...</li>
            <li> the brush head the original tooth brush came with had strong bristles and loved it so after 6 months of usage, it was time to get new brush heads</li>
            <li> These work fine, fit the toothbrush fine.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;they fit and work fine on my brush.</li>
            <li> They stay on just fine, but they don&#x27;t compare to the ones available four years ago.</li>
            <li> These work just fine if they fit.  </li>
            <li> I should have returned them but ran out to Harmon, bought them again and they fit fine.</li>
            <li> Convenient little devils; take them off the Philips Sonicare brush and they become perfect travel size brushes, and the color-coded rings are helpful for sharing the vibrating part.</li>
            <li> I like the best was they come in a little cover for the heads</li>
            <li> They are very comfortable and get into all the right places.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the indicator is accurate on when to change the brush head...</li>
            <li> I bought them on Amazon for such a great price with free shipping.  </li>
            <li> I bought these brush heads a year ago, and the difference between then and now is huge.  </li>
            <li> These heads fit the easy clean sonic care.</li>
            <li> I picked this rating because the brush heads fit .  </li>
            <li> I saved money, got free shipping</li>
            <li> My wife is a fervent user of this toothbrush but everywhere we looked in town, the replacement heads weren&#x27;t available.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t even available at the Philips online store.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;d be great if Philips Sonicare offered different size heads or bristle types.</li>
            <li> It is important to replace your Sonicare electric toothbrush heads about every 3 months so the brushing will remain effect at cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li> These brushes are comfortable to use and hold up to all of the brushing minutes.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush itself is more updated,streamlined,efficient, feature laden and fun to use</li>
            <li> but I just pushed them in securely and they fit.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed at how well the sculpted contoured bristles fit the curves of my gumline and teeth.  </li>
            <li> When my Elite died after 6 years, I replaced it with a Flexcare because the smaller, lighter size and dual voltage made it great for traveling overseas.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All genuine too</li>
            <li> We tried all three and none would fit.  </li>
            <li> Phillips Sonicare HX6013 ProResults Brush Head Standard, 3-Pack, is a great product.  </li>
            <li> and  I have used this brush with whitening paste and now they feel fabulous.</li>
            <li> Service was fantastic and I would recommend these brush heads and sonicare to everyone</li>
            <li> They fit inside the UV light holster.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Thank you for providing this important product.........</li>
            <li> The heads fit the [[ASIN:B000UK2W4C</li>
            <li> BUT SUCH A GREAT PRICE.  </li>
            <li> Worked with my current sonicare and I would recommend to anyone looking for a great deal for replacement brush heads</li>
            <li> You pay more but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> Great price after shopping online and at local retailers for a sonicare replacement head</li>
            <li> but it un-attaches before I&#x27;ve finished even a light brush cycle, which means that A)</li>
            <li> but they sound like junk immediately, and look like junk after a month.  </li>
            <li> They are cheaper than the heads in stores, but appear to be the same quality, so I am happy.</li>
            <li> but if you look closely their logos are blurry, the brush heads don&#x27;t fit, and they have to be replace every 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe these are Philips Sonicare brush heads, but they do fit and look official with a part number printed on them.</li>
            <li> Makes me want to smile more.</li>
            <li> Sonicare electric toothbrushes have been such great products, I truly hope this is not a ploy by Sonicare to spur sales of replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li> They fit, just as stated.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this two stars because Amazon was great about taking them back.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t want to sound paranoid.</li>
            <li> Comfortable brush head.</li>
            <li> This does not look like a genuine product.</li>
            <li> I purchased these brush heads several months ago and they were great.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy the 3 pack since I was unsure if it would fit the toothbrushing unit</li>
            <li> Free shipping and no taxes are a plus.  </li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s free shipping is what I look for.</li>
            <li> They brush well and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> However, if the diamonds weren&#x27;t available, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to order these again.</li>
            <li> Great product; will be buying these in the future from now on.</li>
            <li> which is useful in a household with more than one toothbrush that uses this type of brush head.</li>
            <li> I added these brushes to our automatic subscription to take advantage of the added discount and free shipping.</li>
            <li> and we are happy with the overall experience.</li>
            <li> Neither fit my Sonicare</li>
            <li> Much better quality and worth the price.</li>
            <li> They fit which was my biggest concern.  </li>
            <li> There is no way that these brushes cost even 5% of the price charged to make, but like razor blades, the company could give away the handle for free and make a fortune selling just the brushes.  </li>
            <li> Even the printing looks cheap compared to genuine Philips Sonicare brushes.</li>
            <li> I was happy in receiving these on a time to have extra heads.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> These fit the Philips Sonicare HX6733/80</li>
            <li> This is a great price for these replacement heads and the quality is just the same as the ones that came with my Phillips Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The don&#x27;t feel cheap and tend to hold up well.</li>
            <li> One of the brush heads didn&#x27;t fit the unit.  </li>
            <li> They fit my handle.</li>
            <li> Fit my sonicare just as stated.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is great because you can recharge it using any current.</li>
            <li> Great for travel outside the US.</li>
            <li> These brushes exactly fit the brush that I have.</li>
            <li> The description fit just what I got.</li>
            <li> They fit my Philips Sonicare ProResults tooth brush</li>
            <li> Then I  order from different supplier, then they are great.</li>
            <li> This one does a good job, but we had one brush (so far) that would not stay on the motor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started another one, and so far so good.</li>
            <li> I first liked the \\&quot;Compact Head\\&quot; model, but now I prefer this \\&quot;Full Head\\&quot; size and the contoured bristles.</li>
            <li> Love it, does the job right.</li>
            <li> This item does not go on sale very often and having it locked in to a regular price and delivered to my door is very nice!</li>
            <li> These are the same brush heads that come when you buy your toothbrush new, they work fine and fit the sonicare flexcare perfectly</li>
            <li> It is lightweight yet sturdy and very effective, especially with whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Philips has created a perfect scenario for counterfeiters by charging such extremely high prices for a product that is extremely cheap to manufacture.  </li>
            <li> It make our teeth feel very clean and fresh every day and night</li>
            <li> These fit our unit and work just like the original ones.  </li>
            <li> but somehow I have a feeling that they fit not as snug as the original two that came with the unit.</li>
            <li> but they are definitely are an investment because I am proud to smile my nice new smile! :)</li>
            <li> In order to qualify for the rebate and the free replacement head you have to return an original receipt and an original UPC symbol from the package.  </li>
            <li> Pretty sure this is not the genuine replace heads from Philips.</li>
            <li> Love both very much.</li>
            <li> They fit going on, but as soon as I turn my toothbrush on and start brushing they slide right off!</li>
            <li> The brushes are good, just a wee bit soft for my taste, but are adequate.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> My original brush head lasted me 3 months like it should</li>
            <li> This was equivalent to the original brush head I received with the Sonic Care HX6530 ProResults.  </li>
            <li> Customer Service Representative suggested that if it were given as a gift I should have ask for original copies of receipts.   </li>
            <li> No suggest for the original UPC gifen for a gift.  </li>
            <li> The original was purchased in 8/09.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The prices have more than doubled since my first one.</li>
            <li> so it scores again with us and with another product priced significantly lower than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> all seem to be original products.. will use this shop again</li>
            <li> Not only do we love it, but we&#x27;re getting better checkups too!</li>
            <li> I wish it was a bit cheaper then its original price.</li>
            <li> Item arrived in original package as specified in sellers ad.</li>
            <li> I originally wanted to purchase the brush heads from Amazon because the price at the big-box stores has increased significantly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I got the shaft on this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure these are knockoffs of the original.</li>
            <li> A FROM THE ORIGINAL MANUFACTURER????&lt;br /&gt;BRUSH HEAD DOES NOT SEEM UP TO QUALITY</li>
            <li> (I ordered some with my original handle purchase).  </li>
            <li> They are just like the original.  </li>
            <li> Well, they should be identical to what comes with the original toothbrush</li>
            <li> My mouth is small and I have ocasional bleedings so this is the best to go with your Philips sonicare.</li>
            <li> You gotta buy the original ProResults replacements.  </li>
            <li> genuine parts, the full size, and work well.</li>
            <li> a person with a long history of cavities and tooth/gum issues, I can proudly say since I started using these</li>
            <li> the original head my Sonicare came with, and</li>
            <li> Just like the original one that came on the brush.</li>
            <li> original-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased these in the past &amp; they were great!</li>
            <li> I just ordered these after the original brush lasted me two years.</li>
            <li> I would spend the extra money to make sure you&#x27;re getting an authentic product and don&#x27;t damage your gums!</li>
            <li> The product is the original manufacturers item.</li>
            <li> I did some real searching for saving on purchasing my brush heads and certainly made a good find with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> Product is very good, I was for a friend, a friend like after use, next time will be in to buy, thanks</li>
            <li> My teeth are clean...?</li>
            <li> These brush heads, along with my Phillips Sonicare HealthyWhite toothbrush, make for a thorough, dentist like clean every time.</li>
            <li> I feel like my mouth isn&#x27;t clean unless I use my Phillips HealthyWhite with these brush heads.  </li>
            <li> Super cheap &amp; convenient compared to purchasing from Dentist or Store.</li>
            <li> even if you don&#x27;t pay shipping, they are way too expensive for what they are, but if you own and use this excellent tooth brush-</li>
            <li> Want to have squeaky clean - just had a cleaning @</li>
            <li> the dentist clean.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for this in all the Publix and supermarket near my house, I finally found it on Amazon and is perfect!</li>
            <li> I have no problem keeping my teeth clean now.</li>
            <li> They keep my teeth so clean.</li>
            <li> I feel clean all the time.  </li>
            <li> and I do the two-minute &#x27;Clean&#x27; mode</li>
            <li> I drop these into a water glass with denture cleaner about once a week to clean them and my manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> how clean my teeth get.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush will clean your teeth like the professionals at the dentist.</li>
            <li> my teeth are squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> They clean your teeth and make you feel as if you had just been to the dentist for a cleaning.</li>
            <li> 3 pack makes it easy to keep up with having a fresh brush.</li>
            <li> My teeth are shiny clean.</li>
            <li> Clean just like they are supposed too.  </li>
            <li> Good brushes, hold up pretty good as long as you don&#x27;t apply to much force (which you should not do anyway).</li>
            <li> Nothing special to write about.</li>
            <li> YEAH RIGHT!</li>
            <li> I love the sonicare toothbrush, they really keep my teeth thoroughly clean.</li>
            <li> Received in a short time, great price, appreciated the product availability which made replacing our product easy and quick.</li>
            <li> We alternate days brushing with Braun Oral-B and feel that the combination of the two electric tooth brushes does a good job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sonicare wants us to buy more often.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if there are any true benefits to getting a whitening version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These brush last about 6 months, so it&#x27;s good to have an auto refill.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I both didn&#x27;t believe the claim that this system would actually whiten your teeth, but we have noticed good results.</li>
            <li> ...at a fair price.    I&#x27;ve been using a Sonicare for several years now.</li>
            <li> The system really works--I love my Philips Sonicare, and I couldn&#x27;t imagine NOT using it now.</li>
            <li> It has made my teeth SO much cleaner (no plaque), my gums are in much better shape and my teeth are whiter.</li>
            <li> Wish they had some good generic ones, but by others reviews, that is not the case.</li>
            <li> I love my Phillips sonicare toothbrush, but it&#x27;s really a luxury at these prices.  </li>
            <li> the brushes go one easy and are simple and stay nice and clean.</li>
            <li> It has made my teeth SO much cleaner (no plaque), my gums are in much better shape and my teeth are whiter.  </li>
            <li> and my mouth is still full of toothpaste--it&#x27;s a nightmare.</li>
            <li> Is that good enough?</li>
            <li> how I love the newer style brushes; much easier to remove and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like these better than the &amp;#34;bulkier E Series&amp;#34; replacement head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have the replacement heads to pop on about every 3 months,when the old one needs replacing.</li>
            <li> Overall, these heads do a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought a 3pk for my sonicare flexcare+ 6072/6950 brush model, fit perfectly and looks the same as my default old brush head that came with the toothbrush itself when I first bought it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect such a good quality</li>
            <li> Glad there is a replacement for my electric toothbrush since I paid so much money for it.  </li>
            <li> However, I try to frame the cost in terms of the savings I accrue by taking such good care of my teeth.</li>
            <li> This product not only brushes your teeth, but also stimulates your gums for good oral health.  </li>
            <li> There is something nice and exciting about brushing your teeth with a new brush head..feels like you just went to the dentist</li>
            <li> Amazon is a little high, but when you figure in the free shipping, perfect!</li>
            <li> They definitely don&#x27;t fit right though.</li>
            <li> now I can just use these and replace more frequently because they are cheaper and they ship so quickly!  </li>
            <li> A great plus was that I received them extremely fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very pleased with the shipment and inspite of the other issues with the order, I still was able to use this after an awesome in-store purchase for the same model Sonicare toothbrush</li>
            <li> With daily use the brush heads probably last around 2 months at best.</li>
            <li> I checked many local and internet stores and couldn&#x27;t find this item for a better price.  </li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare Brush Heads are some of the most expensive to replace and Amazon.com has the best deal.</li>
            <li> Came quick.</li>
            <li> They cover my teeth much better and feel more like a regular sized toothbrush in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Simply replacement heads for specific Sonicare toothbrush handles (FlexCare &amp; ProResults), which I believe are the best electric toothbrush systems.  </li>
            <li> I was happy to find these replacement heads for my Sonicare for such a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> The brushes had worn out too quickly.</li>
            <li> The last ones I purchased were through a different seller and they were perfect.  </li>
            <li> Seem more durable than older models.</li>
            <li> And the brush seems to wear out quickly.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was quick as well...</li>
            <li> I also ordered this product and received it quickly.</li>
            <li> Super product.  </li>
            <li> arrived quickly and as described.  </li>
            <li> Came quick.</li>
            <li> The product shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying brush replacements for the ProResults Sonicare model and have never had one wear out so quickly.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Love these brush heads Always ordering more since I can&#x27;t get enough of them and need extras for traveling and stuff.</li>
            <li> Came quickly.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much easier to clean!</li>
            <li> These brush heads seem pretty comfortable to use and they seem to hold up about as well as the heavier Sonicare brush heads.  </li>
            <li> and they fit my toothbrush exactly.</li>
            <li> Great for braces, these LARGER Sonicare brushes are a lot better for braces than the smaller ones.</li>
            <li> A very reasonable price for this item!</li>
            <li> Very Satisfied, I would definitely order again from this company.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended Sonicare a long time ago and remarks each time I see him how good my teeth look.  </li>
            <li> It appears to be, but it doesn&#x27;t fit quite right on the toothbrush and after using it for a while, it just pops right off.  </li>
            <li> I loved these larger heads and the price beat those of the large chain stores!</li>
            <li> I received this new tooth brushes I could feel a HUGE difference!</li>
            <li> The new model is much better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The new top of the line brush for Flexcare is $35 for 3.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> every new set, you get more colored bands to denote whose is whose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with my new Flex-Care Plus toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love my Sonicare toothbrush and couldn&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> So they work, they were new, and I was satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Sonicare for many years but this is a new model.  </li>
            <li> so I am very pleased being able to have the brushes delivered on a predictable schedule</li>
            <li> They are a perfect toothbrush , long lasting and durable.</li>
            <li> Sonicare is the only one he&lt;br /&gt;mentioned, and am I glad!</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for and needed!  </li>
            <li> Only authentic replacements from now on!</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s small, light, a very nice gadget.</li>
            <li> I received quick service and it was priced right.</li>
            <li> I think that is a bit much, 6 months is fine,</li>
            <li> This whole combination is a fantastic product for oral hygiene</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re ready to enjoy your FlexCare.  </li>
            <li> It fit my sonicare toothbrush perfectly at a much lower cost.</li>
            <li> it seems they are a cheap knock-off of the real Philips replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li> Either way, they are worth it.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s all mostly worth it in the end.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, sonicare&#x27;s plastic appears to be virgin (no regrind added to the mix) which in this day of injection molding is a rare item to find.  </li>
            <li> Brushing teeth has never been so much fun.</li>
            <li> as expected , good product , recommended.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased one of the newer models and I enjoy it much more now that I have braces</li>
            <li> I have a healthy white sonicare, I want to know if these will fit my brush?</li>
            <li> but well worth the difference in price.</li>
            <li> You can probably replace them every 6 months to get your money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> They fit better,feel better and last longer.</li>
            <li> If they did I&#x27;d say they were well worth it.</li>
            <li> I thought, for sure Amazon would have fixed this by now.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit our Healthy White toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> More cost efficient in the 3-pack, these sonic brush-heads last a while and leave your teeth feeling smooth.  </li>
            <li> Still a great product, especially if you don&#x27;t need sensitive brush heads.</li>
            <li> Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a powerful brush, then use these heads.  </li>
            <li> These toothbrush heads don&#x27;t quite fit the Healthy White, despite being the &amp;#34;official&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re worth every penny to me.</li>
            <li> They are over-priced IMO, but some things are worth splurging on.</li>
            <li> Bristles seem to soft and inconsistent to be authentic.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush and the replacement heads are definitely worth the cost.</li>
            <li> For the price for 3 of them, to me, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;re happy with these brush heads, and the price is exactly half of what we saw at Costco!  </li>
            <li> I bought the extra brushes ahead due to the excellent price.  </li>
            <li> and I have never been more satisfied with any other toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Package came on time (quickly), product was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> I like that the brush heads are not as large as the Braun and it leaves my teeth feeling just as clean.</li>
            <li> Another amazing thing about these brush heads is I am amazed at how clean the bristles get the surface of the tooth without being rough on the gum line.</li>
            <li> Also, the brush heads don&#x27;t feel quite right too.</li>
            <li> This gave me the right info to know</li>
            <li> They look like the right brush heads</li>
            <li> The bristles turned to a grayish color right away.</li>
            <li> I suspect that the reviewer who thought these were &amp;#34;factory seconds&amp;#34; was probably right on the money.  </li>
            <li> Well, lets try it again, put it on, turn it on, vibrated right off again.</li>
            <li> Yes, no doubt, it is working perfectly right now.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t made right.</li>
            <li> The price is right -</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are just the right size.</li>
            <li> (Yes, I bought the right ones.)</li>
            <li> Yes, they were the right ones.</li>
            <li> It is the right head, though, and it came packaged well.  </li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> These are so much easier to clean and are cheaper.  </li>
            <li> Really clean your whole mouth well.</li>
            <li> they were the &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; tooth brush heads but these particular ones and cheap.</li>
            <li> You can get these anywhere, it is just easier here and usually a bit more cost effective.</li>
            <li> After 2 months, the brush doesn&#x27;t clean very well</li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazon is also offering a good price compared to other sources, so I have to say this is overall a good product at a good price, and if treated properly it could last a year.</li>
            <li> And best of all a super low price, half of some places!</li>
            <li> The other tiny heads are great for nooks and crannies, but you cover more surface area with these bristles, meaning each tooth receives more brushing in the same time period.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, Amazon, for making that right!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: these brushes are perfect replacements for several models of the Sonicare line, at a slight discount (maybe 20%) off retail.</li>
            <li> Apparently, I brush more vigorously than my wife and son.  </li>
            <li> Pretty rare for someone my age, and I believe that a lot of that has to do with this brush</li>
            <li> The first one I used was good, but then neither of the other two would stay on my toothbrush when I was brushing.</li>
            <li> brush is awesome, and my cleanings that I get done at regular intervals, every 6 months, go with little problems because of this brush.</li>
            <li> On top of that the packaging is different than normal and it doesn&#x27;t seem to fit on the tooth brush quite right.</li>
            <li> Shipped super fast</li>
            <li> Not Amazon&#x27;s fault but Sonicare should consider selling the replacement heads for less overhead and keep folks brushing their teeth with good quality brushes.</li>
            <li> still good none the less.</li>
            <li> Cheap, don&#x27;t fit into toothbrush properly</li>
            <li> At least I got something useful lol.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and the new design is much lighter than it&#x27;s older models.</li>
            <li> The ProResults model does a very good job, is light weight and the charger requires very little counter space (slightly larger than the size of the tooth</li>
            <li> but the right replacement parts are essential rather than cheap knock offs!</li>
            <li> and they came very fast after I had order them.</li>
            <li> It helps me to remember to change the heads on time and the price is very reasonable compared to shopping in stores.</li>
            <li> Not much to report other than these are great!</li>
            <li> Purchased for about 1/2 the price on along lasting good cleaning toothbrushes &amp; got them quick with low shipping cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found on the Internet how to remove the Top from the Main Body of the Toothbrush but getting the old brush off the \\&quot;gearings\\</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll know it&#x27;s time to replace the brush when the old bristles start to spread out, but just to be sure, the replacements come with handy little month stickers that you can put on your charger base.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bristle feels very soft than the original brush head.</li>
            <li> Loose fit and pulls off easily</li>
            <li> Then it just didn&#x27;t feel right - the bristles felt too soft, and my teeth didn&#x27;t feel clean.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought I was being too aggressive with my brushing</li>
            <li> Husband really needed these!</li>
            <li> buy-in is pretty costly $100</li>
            <li> Thanks Sonicare!</li>
            <li> I feel like the cost of my toothbrush gets higher after every year.</li>
            <li> The packaging wasn&#x27;t damaged at all and arrived very promptly!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I do not think they have soft ones for sonicare available  </li>
            <li> They are exactly what we needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this exact same product in the past and it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> Not only this, but shipping is free!</li>
            <li> THANKS AMAZON!</li>
            <li> the only one drawback for this package is they dont&#x27; come with the color ring for each head, so it will get confuse sometimes if i have more than 2 brushes at home</li>
            <li> But, I think Philips has too many different models</li>
            <li> This is the first part of a subscription.  </li>
            <li> The first 2 worked well.</li>
            <li> I like these heads better than the smaller heads.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what we needed</li>
            <li> So use Sonicare gently, exactly how they describe.    </li>
            <li> I purchased these toothbrush heads for my Healthy White Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> (my most recent Sonicare brush) for at least&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had already purchased my first ever electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> You can not only save up to 15 percent on the S &amp; S, but you can also request a more liberal replacement subscription schedule if you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do know that this powerful system with these brush heads really do the trick for me.</li>
            <li> when I first start brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not my favorite way to spend 1-2 minutes several times per day....</li>
            <li> Love Sonicare Electric Toothbrush for extra care for teeth.  </li>
            <li> They worked perfectly even though I&#x27;m always skeptical.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and seem to be cheaper than in the stores.  </li>
            <li> After the first couple of uses the heads repeatedly come off as you are trying to brush.  </li>
            <li> this is EXACTLY what you are looking for.</li>
            <li> However, for this style brush refill, the standard size works better.  </li>
            <li> The product was exactly as I had ordered.</li>
            <li> The bristles are abnormally soft when compared to genuine HX6013 brush heads.</li>
            <li> Thanks!  </li>
            <li> They are soft and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush heads DO NOT last more then two months though</li>
            <li> The product came exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> These replacement brushes are exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Absolutely junk!</li>
            <li> You get exactly whats shown.</li>
            <li> They work great and last a long time.</li>
            <li> I use them on the Sonicare Healthy White.</li>
            <li> Not the same quality as the brush which came with my Sonicare, but for the price, I do not mind replacing more often.</li>
            <li> Bristles started falling out within the first week.  </li>
            <li> The bristles started to come out after first use.  </li>
            <li> First time I have had an issue with these heads.</li>
            <li> First time sonciare brush user.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended I get a Sonicare as it would help keep my teeth and gums in better shape between cleaning if I use it regularly.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for making it affordable!</li>
            <li> I especially like the timed brushing to be sure I do get two minutes of brushing done.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> The first two brushes wore out within a week and had errant bristles falling off.</li>
            <li> and i win by sucker punching her in the boob.&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> Exactly as stated, they are exactly as they appear in the ad and to the one in the grocery store.  </li>
            <li> ive been using the first one now still for months already.</li>
            <li> Although the packaging was very convincing and official looking and actually said &amp;#34;Philips&amp;#34;, the performance of the brush heads was nowhere near the stock heads that came with the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I changed more often than that, I&#x27;d just be providing a larger profit for Philips Sonicare.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> And, after using it for the first time, the bristles looked rather frayed...  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve had this happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have bought them from many different places.  </li>
            <li> You pay alot more for the same product at CVS, Rite Aid or even Target or Walmart.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I made sure these were the proper head replacements for my toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I have searched my email but there does not appear to be a reply from them regarding the faulty first brush.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s another fee for return shipping on top of the initial cost for shipping in the first place.</li>
            <li> These work great and last a long time but are way overprice for what they are.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you buy the correct replacement heads as there are a lot out there for the various Sonic toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While these brush heads are not terribly expensive, they are certainly more than a regular manual brush.</li>
            <li> The first one I took out of the package kept popping off the end of my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Heads for Healthy White Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This latest order is further proof.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what we were looking for.  </li>
            <li> remember using these for the first time.  </li>
            <li> I have read where these don&#x27;t do any better job than an regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> These replacement brushes are exact replacements for the Phillips Sonicare HX6013 electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> exactly what i needed.</li>
            <li> Pretty durable product.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to see that these refills appear to be OEM and at a fraction of the cost compared to Wal-mart and other retail stores!</li>
            <li> The good news is that because the toothbrush portion of the unit is so much simpler, a replacement pack of three FlexCare toothbrush heads costs less than what I paid for a two pack of Elite replacement heads.</li>
            <li> it works like I expected it, but i didn&#x27;t really notice it being dramatically more clean or whatever.  </li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, these are identical to the original head that came with the tooth brush---no complaints from me.</li>
            <li> You think that your head isn&#x27;t worn down until you feel how much more powerful the toothbrush is with a fresh head.</li>
            <li> I sectioned an old brush and looked for signs of regrind additives and could no find one spek in the whole brush-head shaft 45 degree cut using polarized light and a 100x</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit very well with my Sonicare tooth brush, brush went soft and dis formed after a couple weeks of use.</li>
            <li> (actually, it arrived before Amazon suggested which was super cool with the Christmas holiday being a factor), and was exactly as advertised...  </li>
            <li> Our 3 month old brushes that came with the unit are in better shape than these 1 week old replacements.  </li>
            <li> These do not appear to be authentic Phillips brand brush heads and are too soft, look completely worn out after about 1 weeks use.  </li>
            <li> These brush heads work well and are more reasonably priced than in our local stores.</li>
            <li> I love my sonicare toothbrush and this alows me to purchase replacement heads much cheaper than local department stores offer.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind a little splashing then this large head is good and gets the job done fast.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about the heads without mentioning that the Sonicare very easy on your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Read carefully and make sure this is the right replacement head for your sonicare</li>
            <li> HX6013 last long (3 month lifespan is the manufacturer recommendation, but they can easily last 5-6 months if treated properly), they fit with a (literal) snap of your fingers and do the best job of all the competitors I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had about 10 days of use on the first head, it is already flattening out and deteriorating, much like you would expect after 3 months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They last about six months which is just right and are identical to the original brush head that came with my unit.</li>
            <li> - The most recent batch of brushes has a VERY snug fit on the stem of the handle; I wonder if they (whoever actually makes these) have changed suppliers or something.  </li>
            <li> Needed a new brush head and this was affordable and worth it.</li>
            <li> It was terrific to get them so easily through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I matched the specs on the type &amp; model of the Sonicare I own but found within less than a week I was having to hold onto the toothbrush head to keep in intact while I brush.</li>
            <li> My oldest son uses the gray one and my youngest one uses the blue one and they come on and off fairly easily.  </li>
            <li> They all come with three different color rings that are easy to snap on or off</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t replace them every 3 or 6 months --- use them for a year or more, they work just fine even after that long --- and my dentist can back me up.</li>
            <li> Great product, use them for past 2 years and see considerable improvement in my oral health.</li>
            <li> Certainly I am saving trips to dentist.  </li>
            <li> Buy the Philips heads from your dentist to be certain.</li>
            <li> These heads are almost certainly counterfeit.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s in large part to my Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is no reason for this apart for pure greed.</li>
            <li> Google Maps and anything on a smart phone would create smarter routes, but this thing does not need the internet.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it stays charged for at least 10 days, making it easy to travel without worry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these many times, but the ones I just opened are such soft bristles I tossed them in 1-week!</li>
            <li> The package itself looked fine, but when I opened it, it was immediately obvious</li>
            <li> They work fine and hold up to three months with twice daily use.</li>
            <li> Philips is evidently taking its cue from the inkjet printer manufacturers -- lowball the main product, then charge all outdoors for the replacement parts.</li>
            <li> And the toothbrush itself is very high quality.</li>
            <li> Although the warranty is clear on the ORIGINAL date of purchase, it seems to me that Philips wouldn&#x27;t want to replace this handle and start a new warrant period.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare ProResults is the best electric  toothbrush ever made and the toothbrush heads which are very expensive, are very reasonable on Amazon&#x27;s subscription plan.  </li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t fit on my Sonicare handle properly.  </li>
            <li> So I can&#x27;t really take advantage of the discount.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone who wants to preserve the health of his teeth and gums.    </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t fall in this trap, as I have found that these heads are very well made and durable.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s all I can really say.</li>
            <li> these are real Philips heads and cheapest price around.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Obviously, they do not want to honor any rebates or free replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> It does an OK job in cleaning, but not much stain removal.</li>
            <li> Also, shipping was fast and you&#x27;re buying from Amazon</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner with Sonicare</li>
            <li> I even feel my teeth cleaner for much longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks for a quality item.</li>
            <li> Even though it is recommended to change them every 2-3 months, I have used mine much longer because they don&#x27;t show signs of wear until the 4th or 5th month.  </li>
            <li> They did not sell replacement brush heads however, so I did an online Google search and after much comparison shopping found them at an affordable price from an Amazon.com vendor.</li>
            <li> If I replaced the brushes as much as I \\&quot;should\\&quot; according to how they feel and</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare products for about 10 years now, and really like them.  </li>
            <li> They contain a wear mark that will disappear when the are ready to be changed.</li>
            <li> DELIVERY WAS VERY PROMPT</li>
            <li> I found these replacement heads to work very well.</li>
            <li> but really didn&#x27;t give me an explanation of why the product was defective.  </li>
            <li> My model is #HX6710 and they claimed the ProResults Standard would fit my brush.  </li>
            <li> I really like these toothbrush heads.  </li>
            <li> The brushes really do the job.</li>
            <li> Thanks Sonicare.</li>
            <li> seems to run out much sooner than the 3 months.</li>
            <li> the real thing, yes</li>
            <li> These brush heads work very well.  </li>
            <li> Look for the real Philips brand brush heads.</li>
            <li> It has enough speeds to find one you feel comfortable with.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll really notice how much cleaner your teeth feel and whiter</li>
            <li> SONICARE THE REAL THING</li>
            <li> It really made me appreciate the performance of the real thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like these tooth brush heads.</li>
            <li> Very convenient.</li>
            <li> I really like the Sonicare</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> so I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a knockoff.</li>
            <li> They work really well.  </li>
            <li> I guess I really have no choice in the matter unless I want to give up my sonicare.</li>
            <li> The brushes deteriorated fast and appear to be counterfeit.</li>
            <li> Real sonicare brushes</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> They fit and they last.  </li>
            <li> This is very misleading that it states USA but ships from the UK.  </li>
            <li> you have really cleaned your teeth and hence my rating.</li>
            <li> 3 of these heads cost about as much as 2 of the e-Series heads.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s holding up very well.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even find the brush heads for the PRO in the store, so this is really convenient.</li>
            <li> (I have never seen numbers on the real brushes and I have had my toothbrush for over 2 years</li>
            <li> and they confirmed they were the correct brushes for the toothbrush, and said they obviously were faulty.  </li>
            <li> Bristles fell out and brushes really stunk..</li>
            <li> This product has worked very well for years.  </li>
            <li> bought these because they are much cheaper than the stores..</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t the real deal.  </li>
            <li> Even a seller may not know as the packaging looks so real.</li>
            <li> I believe this will really help me.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve read that some of the generic ones don&#x27;t fit well</li>
            <li> I have RA and this really helps with holding a toothbrush and reaching all areas of my teeth.</li>
            <li> but it really gets in between the teeth and gum lines.  </li>
            <li> For you dentists out there, it has really solved my gingivitis problems......</li>
            <li> and it cleans your teeth fast..........</li>
            <li> Genuine brush heads usually last in excess of their three month lifespan.&lt;br</li>
            <li> these heads are very durable.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t care for them as much as these.</li>
            <li> It really just depends.</li>
            <li> more..delivery was fast .</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recently I purchased these toothbrush heads thinking that they were legit only to find out that they are cheap FAKES and do not work.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> The real ones maintain their structural integrity for months.</li>
            <li> I could have used them much longer.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> but I still resent how much the replacement heads cost.  </li>
            <li> and it does not wear out as fast.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> If you own the brush these are the larger head vs. the smaller head.  </li>
            <li> Standard heads, good quality, worked as expected.</li>
            <li> Replacement brushes fit base perfectly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally convenient - delivered right to you - and a better price than picking them up at a local store.</li>
            <li> Item came exactly as described, brand new, brand name brush heads, and at a much cheaper price than I could find in any nearby stores.</li>
            <li> These are clearly counterfeit!!!</li>
            <li> They have to be counterfeit because after only 2 uses, I experienced extreme bristle fraying (has never happened in my many years with sonicare products) and harsh vibrations.</li>
            <li> The replacement brushes are exactly like the one that came with the new handle.</li>
            <li> My teeth have never been, or felt cleaner except right after a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to go to a local store to find the genuine (older?)</li>
            <li> The brushes where extremely soft, too soft to actually clean your teeth</li>
            <li> The other B&amp;M stores in the area have it for a lot more.</li>
            <li> I love that you can change out the rings on the bottom for other colors, so you always know whose is whose.</li>
            <li> and I see from other user reviews now that many others have also been ripped off.  </li>
            <li> They are the same as the original heads that came with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Have not tried other kinds to compare, but do love this one.  </li>
            <li> These are factory sonicare brushes, so expect the same quality as you got with your original brush that came with the sonicare unit.</li>
            <li> I went with the Philips brand because I didn&#x27;t want to hassle with sub-par product (i.e. other reviewers say off-brand comes apart or doesn&#x27;t fit right, etc.).</li>
            <li> These are to big to get things clean and they are pricy.</li>
            <li> An electric toothbrush is only as helpful in keeping your teeth clean as the status of the brush head.</li>
            <li> and I am actively seeking a better solution.</li>
            <li> The FlexCare toothbrush is very slender and compact compared to the older Sonicare toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper and easier to use than the brush heads for the older model Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Although they are cheaper, if I had a choice I would have stayed with the older model if it had not broken.</li>
            <li> After brushing, my teeth feel exceptionally clean and I could never go back to a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Seem to last 4-6 months depending on how clean you like your mouth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the dark blue strip is a good indicator of when to change.  </li>
            <li> , I know that you are supposed to change heads regularly, but as long as they are still effective, I continue to use them, just seem to be going through these newer models, much faster than the older ones.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are great in quality, but unfortunately they didn&#x27;t fit perfectly in my Sonic base.  </li>
            <li> THIS IS HIGH QUALITY AND ALSO FAST SHIPPING</li>
            <li> The brush heads are stiff enough to get a great clean, but soft enough to be gentle on the gums.</li>
            <li> (and, at my age my teeth are about the only thing that still works right!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy, but I&#x27;m afraid that my dentist is depressed, since a quick cleaning and checkup are all he gets to do to me.    </li>
            <li> Also had a hard time fitting this on to my Pro, but extra force did it and worked OK.  </li>
            <li> If you are careful with your brush heads, they should LAST WAY MORE than what the marker indicates!</li>
            <li> These are great for everyday use though Philips Sonicare have recently brought out sensitive toothbrush heads</li>
            <li> Overall, not a bad price for brush head replacements.</li>
            <li> The heads are loose and the bristles are extremely soft and get bent out of shape after 2 times of uses at most.</li>
            <li> Taking the heads off to clean the older ones was the main drawback and these are easier to clean and don&#x27;t get messy to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the sonic care, but when mine broke down after just one year, I had to re place it ASAP.  </li>
            <li> However, if I replaced brush heads as directed, I would have to buy a new 3-Pack every 3 months!</li>
            <li> The new brush was purchased a couple of years ago and replacing brush heads every 3-4 months really helps on the visits to the dentist office.</li>
            <li> Really needed new ones otherwise</li>
            <li> I will be buying new REAL tooth brush heads elsewhere from now on.</li>
            <li> I ended up getting new heads much sooner.</li>
            <li> With this design being slightly more compact than the previous version as well</li>
            <li> This pack I purchased has stray bristles that look like they have unfolded and make the brushing experience a bit less enjoyable.</li>
            <li> The brush heads became smaller, therefore less tooth surface is getting cleaned at a moment, and the bristles wear out more quickly.</li>
            <li> Previous ProResults toothbrush heads that I had bought lasted more than 3 months.  </li>
            <li> The Sonicare was a replacement for an older model that I had used for about 10 years.</li>
            <li> I prefer the Standard heads over the Compact heads as they are still relatively petite, but cover more tooth-surface and gum area when brushing.</li>
            <li> Also in terms of longevity, the philips system heads last longer, on the order of 4 months where some \\&quot;bargain brand\\&quot; heads are lucky at 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could tell how stiffer they were compared to my older brush.</li>
            <li> This is a decent product for the system.</li>
            <li> Finally, these brush heads only work with Sonicare&#x27;s FlexCare series --  which is an amazingly light and manueverable brush handle, but that&#x27;s another review!</li>
            <li> These are smaller than most traditional toothbrush heads.  </li>
            <li> AND THIS IS EXACTLY THE SAME PRODUCT SOLD FOR A MUCH HIGHER PRICE ELSEWHERE.  </li>
            <li> This particular order&lt;br /&gt;was</li>
            <li> Since starting to use this particular &#x27;standard size&#x27; brush head I believe my teeth are being cleaned better than ever before.</li>
            <li> They work well, and hold up decently.  </li>
            <li> so if you have an older one, Amazon is the place to get replacements.</li>
            <li> Personally, my gums feel better after using this for this short time.      </li>
            <li> twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, based on my observations this particular added feature to the ProResults brush heads are inaccurate and would not recommend going by this to decide when it&#x27;s time to change heads.</li>
            <li> lead me to believe that these are clever knock-offs, not just representative of some drop in quality on Philips</li>
            <li> Only \\&quot;issue\\&quot; is that you will need to replace these heads more often than you would change a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are the same as the one that came with it (I have a Healthy White model).  </li>
            <li> It is necessary to replace them regularly to make the most of the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Decent price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had very sensitive teeth and gums my whole life.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many items from Amazon and never been disappointed, also, I take advantage of free shipping with a $25.00 or more order.</li>
            <li> The color on the bristles lasts as long as the original that came with the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because of price, but I can honestly say after using it for about a year, it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and was exactly what I ordered and expected.</li>
            <li> Anyway, it worked out fine, as they shipped quickly (free) and by airmail, and the brushes arrived on the 9th day following the order (including the Memorial Day weekend, not celebrated in England).</li>
            <li> The high speed vibrations knock the socks off plaque.</li>
            <li> The two drawbacks are (1) the high price of these brush heads and (2) the longevity of each brush head.</li>
            <li> When I buy these at the drugstore,I pay almost three times as much, I highly recommend this item for people who use sonicare replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I would recommend the Sonicare highly.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it with the sanitizer.</li>
            <li> They hold up well, and they are high quality.</li>
            <li> the cost is so high, you might not want them.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend buying from this seller.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these Sonicare brush heads for your Sonicare system.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to any of my friends.</li>
            <li> the price of the heads is high.  </li>
            <li> They last a good while, I have found that they don&#x27;t last very long if you do the ultralight cleaning too often.</li>
            <li> I therefore use them a little longer than recommended though and make myself feel better about the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always ordered replacement heads thru Amazon, most of the time in the bulk package to save a little.  </li>
            <li> They are not cheap when compared to some other brushes, but how much is it worth to you to easily keep your teeth clean?</li>
            <li> When first using them they seemed to make an odd humming noise which the original heads did not make.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I am over 40, and still have all 32 original teeth, no crowns, bridges, root canals, or even a single pulled tooth.</li>
            <li> The bristles seem like they might be a little different shape than the original brush, but it works just fine.</li>
            <li> A cleaning tip would be to always remove the toothbrush head from the toothbrush itself, rinse it with some water, then let it sit on a clean paper towel to dry.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re much cheaper than brushheads for my old Sonicare Elite which ran about $40.00 for a pack of 3.</li>
            <li> The whole system is about couple hundred bucks, but the heads is nearly 30 buck?</li>
            <li> These things have a very loose fit.</li>
            <li> It cleans very well, but I did not notice marked whiteness in my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Great but expensive.  </li>
            <li> It couldn&#x27;t cost more than a few bucks to manufacture these in mass quantities.</li>
            <li> (it is pretty strange at first), I say keep with it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth spending the extra money and buying the quality ones in store.</li>
            <li> I think the extra frustration may not be worth the savings.</li>
            <li> The packing is quite convincing, but the brush heads are clearly a much lower quality than the ones I usually get.</li>
            <li> The only drawback on these is that they do not last that long - maybe a couple months at the very most.</li>
            <li> This replacement head works just the way it should, but it&#x27;s sure not cheap.  </li>
            <li> I always go to amazon for these things because of the added savings (no tax, free shipping, etc) and without the need to run down to my local big box store and pay 20% more for a product</li>
            <li> Other than that, the quality is fine.</li>
            <li> It works, so it&#x27;s fine but just not exactly the one I was hoping for</li>
            <li> They work just fine though other than that.</li>
            <li> You will be surprised how much of a difference a new brush head makes.</li>
            <li> I can really tell the difference between an old head and a new one.  </li>
            <li> Two minor nits: On/Off button is right where my thumb wants to go</li>
            <li> Finally got the right one.  </li>
            <li> The one I purchased at Philips store has serial number on the brush neck and these don&#x27;t; The brush is too firm; The blue color on the top of the brush is designed to fade as you use to remind you when you should change the brush, and these brushes don&#x27;t fade!</li>
            <li> I am not sure if hard is supposed to be more effective.</li>
            <li> They do not last as long as expected but do a good job before they wear out.  </li>
            <li> I heat going to a store to buy these because I live out in the country and it makes life easier to order them .  </li>
            <li> I ended up getting new brush heads at target.</li>
            <li> Purchased a set of replacement brush heads when I purchased a new Sonicare.</li>
            <li> This marker is just there so that Philips can make money out of you by replacing a FULLY FUNCTIONAL head with a new one.</li>
            <li> (I never installed them when I bought the toothbrush new at BJ&#x27;s wholesale, it came with 2 toothbrushes and charger bases).</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the deal Amazon gives you when you sign up for the automatic shipment that delivers new brush heads every three months.  </li>
            <li> and I signed up to receive automatic shipments of new brushes &amp; this is so convenient.</li>
            <li> Maybe I could get a new one.</li>
            <li> I was told that no company extends their warranties or starts a new one based on a reoccurring problem.</li>
            <li> And with Amazon, we&#x27;re sent a new supply of brushes every three months without having to reorder.</li>
            <li> and it still performs as if brand new.  </li>
            <li> Bought these as replacements for my new Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> have also tried the new Sonicare \\&quot;diamond\\&quot; brushes, and find I prefer these (the Proresults).</li>
            <li> and the new ones do not compare.</li>
            <li> They hold up well to the denture cleaner too, come out like new.</li>
            <li> Had to buy new Sonicare toothbrush so went with the newer model using these brush heads.  </li>
            <li> and I use it whenever I need new brush heads.</li>
            <li> Phillips recommends a new brush head every three months.  </li>
            <li> Has a wear indicator to change to a new brush head.</li>
            <li> I always bought new brush heads on amazon, because they are cheaper than in a drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love my sonic care toothbrush, but it is getting hard to find the brush heads at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> These brush heads arrived promptly and are exactly like what I would normally buy at my local bb&amp;b.  </li>
            <li> They not only didn&#x27;t fit properly on the device</li>
            <li> The brush head didn&#x27;t fit well, the brush head cover didn&#x27;t fit, and after two uses, the brush head looked worse than brush heads</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft, and the heads do not snap onto the brush.</li>
            <li> but they are very soft.</li>
            <li> The last ones I got wore out very fast, they may have been a knockoff.</li>
            <li> Not sure if amazon used a different supplier for my order, but I received a cheap knock-off that didn&#x27;t last for more than 1 day.</li>
            <li> Luckily, the second head is not slipping off the shank.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too much of a hassle to pull it off every week or so and clean, but it seems like the problem is a little bit deeper than that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had three or four Sonicares back to the really old fat ones that had a huge replacement head on them, then the series that had a slightly smaller head, and now the newest that uses these heads.  </li>
            <li> first Sonicare lasted 8 years.&lt;br /&gt;Now, to one which will last 2 years is a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is great for the lazy among us, because who remembers when you last changed it, and how long it has been.  </li>
            <li> -- the brush heads don&#x27;t click on to the toothbrush as the fitting is too small.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare toothbrushes for the last 5-6 years and this is the first and</li>
            <li> I just used it last night for the first time.  </li>
            <li> Target&#x27;s version lasts only a few days, then the fastening mechanism loses its grip, and the heads fly off during operation!</li>
            <li> After several weeks this brush became non-usable compared to the original brush that came with device (when I bought it) which I used for several months before it needed a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still, when compared to what my periodontist charges for a visit, this is a small price to pay, since the sonicare has virtually eliminated most of the \\&quot;pockets\\&quot; around my gumline.  </li>
            <li> and it did the exact same thing.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;m submitting this review -- Amazon rejected the first one even though it met all of their guidelines.  </li>
            <li> I never realized how sub-par my standard toothbrush was until I bought my first Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I replace mine each time the light blue indicator bristles near the top of the brush head goes down, which is roughly once a month.</li>
            <li> Next time I will spend the extra money for the diamond clean ones...</li>
            <li> I used to get these Sonicare brush heads at Costco, but with the new items pushing out the old, they stopped carrying them.</li>
            <li> Why get a new model when the old one still works.</li>
            <li> Just pull off the old brush and push on the new one until it snaps</li>
            <li> I immediately opened the package, removed the old brush head and installed one of the new ones.</li>
            <li> Finally, after one-month&#x27;s use, the bristles on the first brush head look like the old ones did after the recommended three month use-cycle.  </li>
            <li> I then bought the next set of replacement brush heads from Target and the first head has lasted 2 months so far.  </li>
            <li> but I find that the blue strip of bristles fade to white pretty darn fast.</li>
            <li> These last a long time and are much better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> But since they actually shipped only two brushheads, the real per unit cost was much higher at Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The bristles of the third brush head wore out so quickly so that I had to throw that one away too after only about a month (and no, I didn&#x27;t brush my teeth four times a day).  </li>
            <li> More over, after using it for one week, they&#x27;re in worse shape than the brush heads I&#x27;ve worn down for many months.</li>
            <li> These brush heads dont fit (to tight)</li>
            <li> Original brushhead that came with the toothbrush lasted a long time, but finally figured I should replace it.</li>
            <li> Not nearly the same quality as the original brushhead.</li>
            <li> We will continue using the two brushes but already I can see the brushes are not going to last as long as the the original brushes lasted.</li>
            <li> They are loose (and consequently vibrate too much) and eventually these loosened up so much that the heads vibrated off of the handle and into my mouth.  </li>
            <li> but the little rings that come with the heads don&#x27;t fit well, but don&#x27;t affect the function</li>
            <li> These were in the same packaging, but the fit is loose and the quality nowhere near the official brush heads.</li>
            <li> they are not quite as large as the old toothbrush heads for my former sonicare toothbrush..</li>
            <li> A little expensive for toothbrush heads but works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> The packaging looked brand legitimate although different from the past ones - narrower vertical packaging of two on top and one at bottom, as to 3 side-by-side older packaging.</li>
            <li> I can confirm what many other have said about these brush heads - they are definitely not the same heads that came with the brush when I bought it new.  </li>
            <li> I went and bought a 5-pack replacement set from a local store, and the difference is clear: the ones that I ordered from Amazon just can&#x27;t be the real deal.</li>
            <li> These were very brittle and did not last for even a month.</li>
            <li> They are not made very well, especially for the cost!</li>
            <li> and I do not think they are too soft.</li>
            <li> I prefer soft toothbrush.</li>
            <li> When Sam&#x27;s club quit carrying the refills for my Sonicare brush heads ,I was pleasantly surprised to find them on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> The price is so much lower than the $40 per pack I paid recently at a drug store.  </li>
            <li> and it works, just like the old one.  </li>
            <li> What it does lack is instructions for removing the old brush.  </li>
            <li> so naturally one is reluctant to \\&quot;force the issue\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner than when I was using just a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel like I just had a professional teeth cleaning &amp; it seems to be helping tighten the gaps along my gumline.</li>
            <li> Now my teeth and gums are no longer sensitive.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is a knockoff of the real thing because the packaging looks exactly like the real ones</li>
            <li> However, they haven&#x27;t so far.  </li>
            <li> They also make about three times the noise of the old ones.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are so soft I cannot use them.</li>
            <li> Brushes were too soft and started fraying within a week.</li>
            <li> Very upset with this purchase, they are going back, used or not.</li>
            <li> Do you think the UV rays may be causing the blue indicator strip to fade away that much faster?</li>
            <li> Out of the 3 heads in the pack, 2 of them made this noise and were quite loud.       </li>
            <li> (thank you to those who mentioned it), but at least I&#x27;ll know that they&#x27;re authentic.</li>
            <li> When compared to genuine brush heads a nub of plastic is missing from the interior which prevents it from locking in place.</li>
            <li> I would definitely like a refund or to exchange for the real thing.</li>
            <li> My second purchase - not so much.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are way too soft to be sonicare.</li>
            <li> I am going back to Subscribe and Save of the real thing.</li>
            <li> Much prefer the Intercare, which last 4 months.</li>
            <li> Amazon was very cooperative in accepting them back.</li>
            <li> When our old Sonicare toothbrush died (it lasted over 3 years)</li>
            <li> They have not lasted nearly as well as others I have bought for the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Since I started using this brush the problem is completely reversed.  </li>
            <li> The bristles were extremely soft and ineffective</li>
            <li> the bristles were completely bent over and useless&lt;</li>
            <li> I revert to my manual toothbrush when the bristles go too soft.</li>
            <li> (I put my old brush head on, and it worked</li>
            <li> Just 5 days later, I had to change the brush head because the bristles became VERY frayed.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are so soft, they feel like they are over 3 months old already.</li>
            <li> As soon as I replaced the old head, my mouth/teeth felt 100% &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; again with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Also, with subscribe and save the packaging is far easier to open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought real Sonicare tooth brush heads to compare to these fakes and they are completely different.</li>
            <li> so I gave 2 stars, just surprised these came from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Do your teeth and gums a favor with floss, soft picks, and Sonicare brushes.</li>
            <li> It makes me use them far longer than I probably should</li>
            <li> Sonicare is a good system but the brush head 3 pack is $10 too expensive.</li>
            <li> It actually does make your teeth a little whiter and leaves a very clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad because i love my toothbrush but need to find the right bristles for it.</li>
            <li> I like the toothbrush (not better than my rotadent), but the order came quickly, and the brush heads were in the correct packaging for a much cheaper price than in the store.</li>
            <li> there is a little bump that is not on the original ones.</li>
            <li> Bristles are VERY soft, not like the normal Standard bristles i&#x27;ve been using for two years.</li>
            <li> As well,  bristles look completely aged prematurely after just 1 1/2 months unlike the original brush heads which last about in excess of &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> anyways, they clean the same and last the same.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because these are so powerful (used with the Sonicare system), thereby desensitizing me or some other reason.</li>
            <li> Just what we wanted, the same thing but new!  </li>
            <li> However, you&#x27;ve taken the plunge, so you may as well buy them as cheaply as possible, right here at the digital general store.</li>
            <li> The ProResults label also looks odd, crooked, some letters are in different size, done in what most resembles shimmer nail polish and already half-peeled off.</li>
            <li> Heads for my older style brush with larger diameter handle (ni-cad battery powered) lasted 4+ months.</li>
            <li> But after the first few times, they start going on much easier.</li>
            <li> These brush heads seem to last longer/perform better than with past electric brushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> recall my older model, the brush heads seemed to last a lot longer</li>
            <li> The head fits tight and ultrasonic vibration transmits through head adequately</li>
            <li> I do no floss as much as I should, so this goes a long way in helping to mitigate the effects of neglect.</li>
            <li> My brushes arrived with normal Sonicare packaging and are obviously legit.</li>
            <li> As for these replacement brushes, they&#x27;re exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that the blue use indicator seemed to run down faster than the original heads.  </li>
            <li> If the standard head (like a regular toothbrush) fits a normal sized, adult mouth, it seems that you&#x27;re gaining about twice the amount of cleaning action over</li>
            <li> I was so excited to be ordering more online with Amazon Prime, but when I got them it was such a disappointment.</li>
            <li> And the feature where the bristles change color when it&#x27;s time for a new brush head, is a definite plus.</li>
            <li> With the new model, I may take it next time.</li>
            <li> Simply pull off your used brush and pop a new one in its place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased Philips replacement heads where I used to get them, at a nearby big-box store and after several weeks of use, they still appear nearly new.  </li>
            <li> I just changed my brush for the second time since I got my new Flexcare toothbrush about five months ago.</li>
            <li> My whole family after using this for a few weeks, the whole family likes the way the brush cleans.  </li>
            <li> but since they can fit my handle and they are not total wastes of money, 2 stars.</li>
            <li> I now regret I haven&#x27;t made a picture of both the used brush and the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;After using all 3 in an unusual short period of time I bought another pack from a local brick and mortar store - and THOSE are like the brushes I used to have.</li>
            <li> Philips Sonicare HX6013 ProResults Brush Head Standard, 3-Pack is once again a good buy although too expensive.</li>
            <li> In just few days the brush became to deteriorate - curling in all directions and quickly became unusable.</li>
            <li> I got this after my very old Sonicare finally kicked the bucket.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been perfectly content going through about one head every quarter, which at ~$20-30/year isn&#x27;t bad!</li>
            <li> I had purchased these through Amazon once in the past from this seller and was pleased, but the second time I did it was a completely different experience.  </li>
            <li> Had no other choice but to use this inferior knock off.  </li>
            <li> (I brush 2-4 times a day) but they keep my teeth extremely white and clean in comparison to any other standard toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I was able to order at half the price and with the automatic reorder I requested, I don&#x27;t have to worry about reordering when mine are wore down.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say about these brush heads other than they are genuine Phillips parts</li>
            <li> I hope we can find a source for decent ones, otherwise it will be back to a regular tooth brush.</li>
            <li> However, by the beginning of the third week I noticed that the bristles were already wearing down, and towards the end of the third week the bristles showed significant signs of wear.</li>
            <li> They are the right ones for my handle but one of them did not stay on the handle and the other 2 flattened out in only 2 days each making them unusable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They are a little pointed at the tip, which is great for getting behind the back molars.  </li>
            <li> dentist told me that generally speaking, he sees a 30% improvement in gum health for people who purchase this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s mileage will vary with these heads, but I generally get 2-3 months out of one before I have to replace it.</li>
            <li> I floss generally 3 times a week, instead of nightly.....</li>
            <li> They last a long time and seem to do the job very well.</li>
            <li> Amazon and its sellers need to stop selling the counterfeits after so many people have complained for so long.  </li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare in fifteen years, and it has improved considerably.  </li>
            <li> The Sonicare ProResults brush heads improve on the old design by having a simple joint to connect it to the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Further, these are completely sealed units; so, they don&#x27;t trap liquid inside like the Advance and probably the Elite.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t brush back and forth like your old brush, let the machine do the work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finally though I broke the friggin thing trying to get the old brush off.</li>
            <li> Able to have this auto shipped at a regular interval at least $10 cheaper than I can buy this 3 pack anywhere locally</li>
            <li> There is no way these things will last three months, I&#x27;ll be surprised to get another week out of them.</li>
            <li> You absolutely will not regret the money spent on this (any Sonicare) brush.</li>
            <li> However daily use causes the heads to fray and get too soft.  </li>
            <li> Actually, we never really learned much about toothbrushing in dental school.</li>
            <li> and I use one instead of flossing, works just as well apparently.</li>
            <li> The third one completely well off every time I turned my toothbrush on.</li>
            <li> and it took forever to get the cookie out of my natural dips in my back teeth.</li>
            <li> So far I have only used one of the three heads.  </li>
            <li> So all is well as long as it is not a common problem</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not experienced any more brush pieces lodged in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Not bad, but not outstanding.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, if preferring a compact head and having a normal sized, adult mouth, you may want to compensate for less brushing action by increasing brushing time.</li>
            <li> I left on my trip mid September, 2010 with a new Flexcare.</li>
            <li> So only one of us gets the 3rd new one.  </li>
            <li> At less than ten dollars each, they are well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Got them a few weeks ago, using one of them right now</li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 4 star rating is based on the short life of the head, but they do a fantastic job of cleaning when they are in proper working condition, and there is no better feeling on your teeth, unless you are just walking out of the dentists office, for me, there is no  other brand.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve had three brushes wear out in less than 10 weeks.</li>
            <li> In the past, I&#x27;ve used the same Sonicare brush head for 6 months without a significant reduction in the brush&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I have used the ProResults brush heads for the past 18 months and they seem to do a better job than any of the other brush heads I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> After a week of use, the first head came apart, so I pushed it back together and use it very carefully.</li>
            <li> I have found that these brush heads do not last as long as the older e-series brushes.  </li>
            <li> I have used other electric toothbrushes which I do not like as much as Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping and everything expected when I bought this product!</li>
            <li> It is also much cheaper then the other stores that were selling it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only a month into the new brush head and it already went from blue to white indicating it&#x27;s time to replace it.</li>
            <li> The brushes fizzled out right away, the plastic cap barely fits on to the head, and you can easily pull the neck off from the base when trying to remove the whole brush.</li>
            <li> BTW, I gave away a brand new Oral-B spinbrush-style brush because the brushheads were uncomfortably large, so I&#x27;m not kidding about the small mouth.  </li>
            <li> I noticed some people complained that these were cheap imitations of actual Sonicare toothbrushes, but I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> The only downside is Amazon only offers every 6 month</li>
            <li> After only one week of use, these were completely frayed and all the blue color was gone.</li>
            <li> They shorten the bristles that makes it more difficult to brush my teeth, but they say &amp;#34;contoured pattern fits the natural shape of your teeth&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I have owned a sonicare toothbrush for the last 10 years, having recently bought the flexcare, since my old sonicare was plugged into 220, and died.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I changed to a different supplier (still on Amazon) thinking the old supplier had counterfeit products, and had the same problem.</li>
            <li> I have used sonicare toothbrushes on the advice of my periodontist, the electric toothbrush makes it easy to brush all areas, however, the brush heads are not heavy duty like my old manual toothbrush, they require periodic replacement, a bit expensive at around $10 a pop.  </li>
            <li> I have had no problem with these, but I think the price is too high because they don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> They come exactly on time and it makes my life a little easier not having to think about it.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m stuck without any brushes since my next subscription installment is not due until Jan</li>
            <li> changing to the new ones makes a big difference when you use one too long.</li>
            <li> Previously, I had the small head brushes, but these are much better for me.</li>
            <li> The price paid for this was far less than I would normally pay in a retail box store.</li>
            <li> Great :-(</li>
            <li> Make sure the toothbrush heads are compatable with your actual toothbrush and your cant go far wrong.</li>
            <li> but they do not fit exactly.  </li>
            <li> I like switching out the standard head for the compact head to better reach behind the teeth and in the back molars.</li>
            <li> While the price is about $2 less than walmart, the fit of these toothbrush heads is slightly off</li>
            <li> They were so frayed the whole brush head was compacted down and looked almost melted.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush heads get a bit pricey, especially since my husband and I both use them and they really do need to be replaced every three months (instead of every six, like conventional toothbrushes).</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fit down snug over the little metal nub on my Sonicare</li>
            <li> I mean I would much rather use my older brush head than use these.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s supposed to be the right pone but seems small.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers that say the price seems high for this tooth brush.</li>
            <li> they are soft as not to irritate your gums and they last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Replacement heads are very expensive in the stores, but more reasonable on Amazon.   </li>
            <li> The bristles  break down very soon after starting to use them.</li>
            <li> Had these less than month, and already the first replacement is flat, lost it&#x27;s shape, now moving on to the next one.</li>
            <li> Brushes fit base very snugly and offer a crisp brush of the teeth.  </li>
            <li> I like these small ones so much better than those lunky big ones from a few years ago.</li>
            <li> The original brushes lasted for a solid 6 months, These bristles have flattened out in less than half that time.</li>
            <li> It is something that is known going into buying the Sonicare package but pretty depressing when you spend over 100 for the original package.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t seem any more &#x27;complex&#x27; than a standard toothbrush which costs an order of magnitude less.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon, I can get these heads just a little bit cheaper than at Walmart or Target.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are specified for my new Sonicare Flexcare RS980 Toothbrush but also work on some other models.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m out of the purchase fee and three new brush heads due to this purchase.</li>
            <li> - one never snapped on completely, and the other stayed on for only thirty seconds or so while brushing.</li>
            <li> Perhaps this product is not the original because the brush head that came with the actual brush lasted longer and did not have broken and bent bristles.</li>
            <li> They appeared to be exactly the same as the ones I had ordered before, but it was a extremely inferior product compared to the one I previously purchased.  </li>
            <li> The main problem is that the brush does not fit properly on the Sonicare handle and, as others noticed, comes off while in motion.</li>
            <li> we have received the last 2 times, its like the brushes are recycled , or second hand,they do not last as long at all.</li>
            <li> I compared the new ones to the previous heads I purchased from Bed Bath and Beyond</li>
            <li> The color of the bristle are close in color but there are no identifying numbers on the new heads but all of the previous heads that I have used had numbers around the lower edge.  </li>
            <li> This third one won&#x27;t last long either I imagine.  </li>
            <li> I still change only after three months, which is how long they are supposed to last.</li>
            <li> There are some large numbers etched into the front of these, the ones format he store have small print.</li>
            <li> Nott too small , not too large</li>
            <li> even keep a spare 3-pack at home and whenever the subject of toothbrushes comes up (rare, but it happens) in a conversation, I force some of my friends to try a new one out, and at least 5-6 of them converted to the Sonicare after a single use.</li>
            <li> First, the tooth brush is hard.</li>
            <li> I frequently find these on sale locally for less.</li>
            <li> I did discover that the blue color had completely faded on both brushes I had used in less than a month each.</li>
            <li> At first, mine didn&#x27;t last so long, but I realized I was probably pressing too hard.</li>
            <li> around!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t go past the 3 months usage, it really decreases the quality of your oral cleaning.</li>
            <li> called Philips customer service to let them know of this issue, and apparently it is a common problem of which they are aware.  </li>
            <li> Do not be afraid to purchase these - they are the exact same as the one that came in yourf Philips Sonicare when you first purchased it.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t see any way they could last 3-months long without losing their effectiveness.    </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how long they last yet as I&#x27;ve not tried them, BUT</li>
            <li> It takes a long time for the power portion of the tooth brush to actually stop working.  </li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t last as long as they should.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have an issue with generic products so long</li>
            <li> UNFORTUNATLY, THEY DON&#x27;T LAST TOO LONG, BUT THEY WORK AT REMOVING PLAQUE.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had a sonicare for about 6 months, and I have no idea why I waited so long to buy one.  </li>
            <li> These are a little spendy for what they are, but I can&#x27;t live without my Sonicare</li>
            <li> At first I thought that I broke my toothbrush, but then I noticed that the attachment part of these heads is a little bit different than my previous ones-</li>
            <li> No major issues yet.</li>
            <li> I have been using the sonicare for a few years now and have to have new brush heads</li>
            <li> They also last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I have to wiggle and yank at it, and after brushing, it&#x27;s wet which makes it more difficult to get a grip on.</li>
            <li> Bristles frayed in less than 1 weeks use &amp; I am not a heavy brusher.</li>
            <li> So the previous brushes didn&#x27;t feel the natural shape of my teeth??</li>
            <li> After only a few days, the bristles became frayed, spread out and too soft to use.</li>
            <li> ; Once I finally realized these were not real Sonicare brush heads, i just sent an email to Amazon explaining what was going on, and Amazon credited my visa the same evening.</li>
            <li> And since they are not available in the Philippines, which is my home now, I hoped that I would get a few months use out of them, but they appear to degrade, both visibly, and in the fresh feeling you get after a brushing, in about a month.</li>
            <li> Risk the brush head coming loose mid brush and spraying (gunk) all over my bathroom &amp; face and C)</li>
            <li> They look exactly like the previous toothbrush heads I have used, but they do not fit all the way on the brush.  </li>
            <li> They also have a dark blue raised bristle tip at one end that gets right inside hard to reach areas.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this electric toothbrush for years now (was X-mas present) and finally got tired of paying too much money at local stores for one replacement head.</li>
            <li> I owned a Sonicare long ago, one of the big old plain looking ones.</li>
            <li> They work fine but are way too expensive for what you get which is why I&#x27;m giving them 3 stars.</li>
            <li> These things can be a little difficult to find and when you find them they cost more than double the price.</li>
            <li> So I compared them to one I&#x27;d gotten from another source, and saw that the bristle material was different - softer, a different color, and they poked out at a little different angle.</li>
            <li> I ordered them online because it was hard to find them in Target City, since it is smaller than the normal Target stores.</li>
            <li> For my original head i had the plastic ring in place and it was fine, but i noticed with the replacement heads if I use the plastic rings, the head actually eventually comes loose and actually come OFF of the base while i&#x27;m brushing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a good thing when you are on a first name basis with everyone in your dentist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li> Also, they have weird numbers on them that I&#x27;ve never seen on genuine Sonicare brush heads, and the letters look a bit blurry when viewed close-up.</li>
            <li> , just looks like it&#x27;s the wrong part since it doesn&#x27;t fit well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the off brands and they simply are not the same quality so not worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> and it won&#x27;t completely not useable.</li>
            <li> I have a few sensitive issues with my gums.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re still using an old fashioned toothbrush, you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re missing.  </li>
            <li> Received earlier than expected day.  </li>
            <li> Now the second handle has failed for the exact same issue 15 months later (6/12).</li>
            <li> Sonicare has been a leading product for a long time</li>
            <li> Again a minor nit.</li>
            <li> The three pack will last me roughly 6 months.</li>
            <li> These immediately became frayed and soft after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> These worked as expected but can now find them at Big Box stores.</li>
            <li> Just strange.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that I didn&#x27;t realize these were firm bristles rather than soft.  </li>
            <li> Also, after a short period of time they became very loose and would slip off the handle repeatedly.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take long at all, been looking all over for this product</li>
            <li> The bristles are firmly packed, but soft.</li>
            <li> but comes closed to a sale price at the local Walgreens.</li>
            <li> product is complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Thank you Amazon for carrying these even though my Sonicare is a few years old.  </li>
            <li> Disputing charge on credit card is a long process  for a $2.43 price difference.</li>
            <li> Clearly not a quality item, don&#x27;t be fooled.</li>
            <li> They only last a week or so before the bristles are no longer stiff enough to brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> would not recommend the compact version of this brush as it does not have the same bristle configuration and lasts even less time than the standard size brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only that, where the previous brush heads did last 3 months</li>
            <li> Until my new Sonicare HealthyWhite toothbush and this pack of replacement brushes arrived, I was not sure they worked together.</li>
            <li> I will continue to order again when I need new ones as I have in the past..</li>
            <li> How sad that these toothbrush heads need to cost so much money and last for only a short amount of time before they need to be replaced.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more expensive than a manual brush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the Philips Sonicare system even though I feel it is a bit extreme on pricing.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews here that said that they received a fake copy instead of the original product, and thought it wouldn&#x27;t happen to me.</li>
            <li> They slide on to the post with no resistance and then as you brush they fall off due to the vibration generated because the hole is too big..</li>
            <li> How long have these sonicare toothbrushes been out?!?  </li>
            <li> These toothbrush heads are expensive but they are definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> At the store, they are much more expensive!</li>
            <li> I have used the first one for only a few weeks, but it looks like I have used it for at least 6 months.</li>
            <li> What was really disturbing, though, was that my teeth didn&#x27;t feel clean.</li>
            <li> The sonicare toothbrush has been a wonderful way to help protect against expensive, and painful dental procedures.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is that the blue strip fades in a few weeks instead of 3 months.  </li>
            <li> The first brush I used from the package worked fine, but when I replaced it with the second one, I noticed that it did not fit as snug and would fall off the base when I used it.</li>
            <li> So I will have to order a much larger supply of them, my next round of purchasing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am unhappy that the brush heads are so small, but I am even more unhappy that I wind up with one or more bristles left in my mouth after almost every brushing.  </li>
            <li> I also seem to be a victim of counterfeit brush heads.</li>
            <li> oh that was a game show :&amp;#62;)</li>
            <li> They appear to be identical in size and shape to replacement heads I have purchased before, but the dark blue \\&quot;reminder\\&quot; bristles that were on earlier heads are now nearly indistinguishable to the pale green bristles on the rest of the head on this brush (you can tell from the photos on this product page), and they do not resemble the product literature included with the Philips toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Tried knockoff product and ended up with loose bristles in the mouth.</li>
            <li> It hangs loose and leaves a gap between the brush and the handle.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;d just wiggle loose part way through.</li>
            <li> After one use the bristles came loose.  </li>
            <li> If you are closing your mouth on the brush you are in for a shock on the back side but also smashing the bristles down.  </li>
            <li> well I may need to soon swop brands to bring down the overall cost, yes</li>
            <li> The rest of the bristles actually wore down, splayed out, and frizzed.  </li>
            <li> I hope that others with the same experience will also rate this vendor to bring down their over inflated rating.</li>
            <li> The bristles started breaking down after only 1 week.  </li>
            <li> This is not original product, it&#x27;s fake or very low quality copy of original brush.</li>
            <li> These are very very soft, so much so that pressing them onto my teeth the hard plastic hits teeth too!!!  </li>
            <li> being more minimalistic than previous styles they are less expensive</li>
            <li> Compared to the previous brush heads which would ACTUALLY last 3 months.  </li>
            <li> Usually the brush heads become more difficult to find and that is the reason that I upgrade.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in brush performance, plus these last longer and cost less versus the diamond version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They fit the brush poorly and I figured it was a &amp;#34;bad batch&amp;#34; but was too lazy to return them.  </li>
            <li> I found these brushes to be a big step up from the previous Sonicare brushes.</li>
            <li> Also the packaging looks different from usual packaging of such items.</li>
            <li> As opposed to my previous situation, which was about 1 head every 2 months for a total expense of ~$50 a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are expensive, but they hold up pretty well with constant use.  </li>
            <li> The shipment was received on time and the 3-Pack cost much less than a local purchase.</li>
            <li> I shared with them that the first brush had failed but that the second seemed to be working.</li>
            <li> So I went back to the previous supplier (both claimed the brush heads were from Philips)</li>
            <li> &quot; I&#x27;ve used them about a month now and they seem to be as durable as the old Sonicare heads - the reminder bristles change at about a month of use, in spite of being very pale to start with.  </li>
            <li> The standard heads are not as wide as a typical manual toothbrush head.  </li>
            <li> Noticed that the brush did not snap on as tightly when I changed it out, and it fell off within 10 seconds of starting the brush cycle.  </li>
            <li> It may only be a matter of time before the rubber breaks down due to this penetration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just a little extra muscle to make it work.  </li>
            <li> packaging should maybe be a little easier to open.</li>
            <li> Not original Philips pro results equipment, doesn&#x27;t seat on brush properly.</li>
            <li> I have only been using the product a little over a month, and there has been no color change in the bristles, so it isn&#x27;t that the brush head is worn out.  </li>
            <li> A little shopping around located this replacement pack, which was delivered a day later than expected.</li>
            <li> It is the most convenient and least expensive way to procure replacement brush heads for my Sonicare toothbrush</li>
            <li> Not really much else to say about this product is there?</li>
            <li> Only takes a few seconds.</li>
            <li> The brush heads are not readily available at my local drugstore or discount stores.  </li>
            <li> Be careful to order brush that fits your unit.</li>
            <li> The blueish green band and the greenish blue band have cause some confusion.</li>
            <li> Star off for waste packaging - they come in a box, nestled in a giant plastic clamshell, with plastic covers over the bristles, and a single-serving bag for the rings.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush head did not fit properly onto my Sonicare toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works like expected.  </li>
            <li> Not a whole lot to say here</li>
            <li> My next replacement lasted a few months.  </li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare Bush Heads that I purchased through Amazon were received well before I expected to receive the shipment.  </li>
            <li> I carefully matched this with my toothbrush</li>
            <li> Quality as expected.</li>
            <li> Works as expected and lasts as expected.  </li>
            <li> Product is just what I expected.</li>
            <li> These are very likely not genuine HX6013 brush</li>
            <li> These were not real Sonicare brush heads.</li>
            <li> A lot of widely varying reviews.</li>
            <li> NOT REAL Philips Sonicare brush head</li>
            <li> Total waste of money here.</li>
            <li> When the blue starts to fade after a few weeks, you can still get another 2-3 weeks out of it.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money - DO NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> Product was of the quality I expected.</li>
            <li> All that it  was advertised to be and arrived when expected.</li>
            <li> There is not much for me to say about this product, but I needed toothbrush heads to brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> They where what I expected</li>
            <li> They work as expected.</li>
            <li> Work just as expected.</li>
            <li> Not much to it.</li>
            <li> They are just what I expected.</li>
            <li> expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Brush head keeps slipping off.</li>
            <li> but all in all i just had to carefully take it off when switching toothbrushes with my housemates.</li>
            <li> But even at $8/each, they are well worth it if you save on really expensive periodontal procedures.</li>
            <li> about once a year, and I brush my teeth twice daily and still have my natural permanent&lt;br /&gt;teeth, except for one implant about 25 years ago&lt;br /&gt;due to a broken molar.  </li>
            <li> After only 2 weeks&#x27; use, these brush heads literally mashed down, were so worn they were not worth using for brushing teeth.  </li>
            <li> then you slide the other head back down onto the shaft and there you go!  </li>
            <li> these got to me quickly and were less expensive than the ones in target.  </li>
            <li> The large heads get the job done faster, but if you had your wisdom teeth removed due to space issues, the small head may be needed to get behind your last molar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is not much to say other than if you buy a Brush,Always by the name brand.</li>
            <li> The blue indicator seems a little lighter than my previous one but it still gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> But this time, the brush heads are fake, the brush hair is so week, not hard enough.</li>
            <li> complaint is on the design of these heads and the toothbrush in general.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands [cheaper] and found you get what you pay for in cleaning effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> The compact one is simply too small to brush with and as a result, takes longer to brush.</li>
            <li> Just easier/cheaper than getting it from costco or other outlet centers.</li>
            <li> No more gross feeling on my teeth</li>
            <li> Like all other toothbrushes, these wear out and need replacing.</li>
            <li> They should last 2-3 months, based on past experience and as stated in the product description.  </li>
            <li> Read the other 1 star reviews to see that these aren&#x27;t legitimate.</li>
            <li> I have never been more disappointed in a product ordered from Amazon.</li>
            <li> The other two brushes are working but the identifier colored ring does not snap into place.</li>
            <li> Judging by other reviewers of this product I suspect I was shipped counterfeits.</li>
            <li> Not sure if other reviewers have a different Sonicare than I do</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if these are actually made by sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Other off brand can damage your handle and/or your teeth.  </li>
            <li> other brands don&#x27;t hold up.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried other replacement heads and believe this one is best...unless i just bought a crappy set of off-brands??</li>
            <li> The brush heads I received were obviously counterfeit and not authentic Philips products.  </li>
            <li> It was cheaper then all other competitors.  </li>
            <li> In any case, while the second brush did last a couple weeks or so, it too, failed, as did the third one, almost immediately.</li>
            <li> The brush costs a lot on its own with its charging base (about $70 list); and even more if you get the UV sanitizer (I paid over $100 for the brush, replacement heads, base and sanitizer).  </li>
            <li> In addition, the label on the heads look very rough.</li>
            <li> The old design tended to accumulate water, toothpaste residual, and saliva inside it, which would then crust and get nasty if you didn&#x27;t clean it regularly.</li>
            <li> Either they got them cheap from Phillips because they were a crap batch or they are a total fraud.</li>
            <li> Only lasted a few days before completely dead.  </li>
            <li> so you have take extra care to push it securely onto the base</li>
            <li> I like that the design doesn&#x27;t waste a big half circle of plastic on every brush like my previous Sonic Care did.</li>
            <li> I like the size of the brush heads as it is small enough to maneuver around the hard to reach places (back teeth).</li>
            <li> I have a very small mouth, and the compact size generally works well for me</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t it time the price dropped down to about $5 bucks for a three pack, I mean, the price is ridiculous if you know how much each one of these cost to make!</li>
            <li> I used to change my heads every 3-4 months, now with the newest set I went from \\&quot;blue to clear\\&quot; (all the way down) in less than 1 MONTH!!  </li>
            <li> Its very hard to find the brushes for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Sonicare Flexcare beats all other toothbrushes hands down.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and I am fairly certain that it is a fake.</li>
            <li> Took a little getting used to, but the learning curve is minimal.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They are a complete waste of money and &amp;#34;Philips&amp;#34; should be very worried as I see by the bad reviews that I am only one of MANY people that have had the same BAD experience with these fake replacement</li>
            <li> When I compare them to other Phillips brush heads, there are slight differences in the name printed on the brush heads.  </li>
            <li> The key is not pressing too hard on the teeth.</li>
            <li> Only one complaint -</li>
            <li> I guess the sell real replacement brush but the also sell fake one.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is there&#x27;s not 4 of them.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the price I paid whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> Worse yet, the brush quality is far inferior.</li>
            <li> It went down 3 feet and landed on carpet.</li>
            <li> Hopefully years down the road.</li>
            <li> and hopefully that eliminates the need for gum surgery down the road.</li>
            <li> When is the price coming down?</li>
            <li> They break down after a month.</li>
            <li> The price also goes down with subscription which can be canceled any time.</li>
            <li> Either they changed the design, or the quality just went down for the pack of three, but go buy the two pack.....</li>
            <li> This is similar to other highly counterfeited products such as expensive hand bags and expensive sun glasses.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used Sonicare for several years now, and even though I am often late on getting my teeth cleaned, the dental hygienist always comments how little plaque I have.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love this 900 Series toothbrush even though the heads are rather expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received this item faster and for less money than if I&#x27;d bought it here in Canada...</li>
            <li> After less than one week of use, the bristles are all bent out of shape.</li>
            <li> say a 2 minute period as compared to using a compact brush head that is about half the size.</li>
            <li> They also appear to be softer than previous head replacements.  </li>
            <li> However, the brush heads need to be replaced in less than 3 months contrary to what they claim.</li>
            <li> and i think i feel less guilt throwing away</li>
            <li> Have not had this problem with previous orders</li>
            <li> I get a month and a half to two months per head</li>
            <li> but in comparison, the bristles of these are slightly lighter in color.</li>
            <li> These bristles are softer, shorter, and less dense than the originals.  </li>
            <li> I was actually looking for the compact heads but bought the standard heads because they were less expensive.  </li>
            <li> The rubber has odd nodules on it.</li>
            <li> A brush head that typically lasts for months was worn out in less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> It is the typical Magellan product.</li>
            <li> my previous order.  </li>
            <li> That leads to a slight rattling/humming.</li>
            <li> These brush heads were useless and wore out in less than 1 month and the last one simply fell apart after about 2 weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> Elsewhere on this site you can 6 heads for almost half the price.</li>
            <li> In less than a month it looked like 6+ months.</li>
            <li> These brush heads can probably be manufactured for less than $0.20 each and are sold for $8.00 each.  </li>
            <li> I ordered these and in less than a week the bristels were falling out and the brush head looked like it had been used for years.</li>
            <li> They are the typical sonicare heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using 1 for about a week and a half, twice a day and the bristles are already falling to the side.</li>
            <li> Bristles bend over and bend after less than one week.</li>
            <li> odd thing here is that I ordered from a vendor who ships from the UK, and their Amazon listing says nothing about this.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed...and a little concerned over what the brush heads that mashed down were made out of.  </li>
            <li> so I eased up, but when the second brush started wearing out again, I knew this was not a good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if these are defective or not really Sonicare brushes.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes these heads are a little difficult to attach to the main unit at first; once I thought I bought the wrong heads for it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to accompany my new Sonicare, unfortunately I had some issues with the delivery of the toothbrush</li>
            <li> These are just right for my electric toothbrush but so very expensive.</li>
            <li> Each brush head should last for at least 3 months, based on my past experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare for a little over 12 years.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads are a little pricey</li>
            <li> The bristles could be a little softer on the brushes.  </li>
            <li> With a little fiddling, they seem to work though.  </li>
            <li> Reason for 3 star rating is because they were a little pricey.</li>
            <li> He is pretty useless at buying me gifts!</li>
            <li> it was too weak only 3 times brush start to splits</li>
            <li> The replacements are a little pricey, but what did you expect when you bought the toothbrush itself?  </li>
            <li> so the little covers can&#x27;t be used because you pull the head off every time.</li>
            <li> These are nothing like the Sonicare heads I have ordered from Amazon in the past, and I agree with other reviewers who state</li>
            <li> I suspect that these are knock-offs and not true Sonicare heads based on their short life and poor construction.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re already worn down after just 1 week!</li>
            <li> Be careful not to brush too hard - the gums will start receding.</li>
            <li> However, the pricing of these which are just basically plastic is really kinda crazy.  </li>
            <li> I had a horrible experience with the knock off brands where while they fit initially, they start to become lose and come off in your mouth while brushing.  </li>
            <li> If you have a Philips Sonicare toothbrush, then you are stuck with buying these, which are NOT cheap by any means.</li>
            <li> these do not fit as well on my Sonicare HX6733 as the OEM brushes did.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to waste my time and gas running around purchasing the replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> and we have not been having much trouble with our oral health at all.</li>
            <li> They fit to my base</li>
            <li> I do approximately 75% of my shopping at warehouse clubs which is where I made my initial toothbrush purchase.</li>
            <li> I have a flexcare toothbrush (one listed on the package that it&#x27;s compatible with) and this time around it did not fit at all</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, the retail store private labelled alternatives we tried were worse - wore out in two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The bristles last approximately forty percent longer.</li>
            <li> We have been using these brush heads for a few years and buying them through Amazon.</li>
            <li> The Brush Head pack that was sent to me does not fit on my Philips Sonicare ProResults.  </li>
            <li> Purchased these replacement heads and 1) they do not fit like they should when you pop them on 2)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The bristles of the brush literally look like they were cut by hand, uneven, longer pieces sticking out here and there.</li>
            <li> These do not fit the power head as well, and almost seem like they might pop off during use.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to save some money, but that money has now been wasted and I have to buy another set.</li>
            <li> would not buy it again as the bristles just gave out after a few uses as compared to the one purchased at cvs</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on them!!&lt;br /&gt;S.F.M.</li>
            <li> These did not fit the brush head as they were supposed to.  </li>
            <li> Not as messy as the bulkier ones.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using one for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I am writing this for others so they don&#x27;t waste their time with this seller.</li>
            <li> I thought I would save a few bucks and buy the Target knock-off.</li>
            <li> Recommended by our dentist, we&#x27;ve been using it for a few years now.</li>
            <li> While these were inexpensive, after a couple of months of use I am concerned that they are not genuine Philips brush heads.  </li>
            <li> The poor performance has me concerned about the authenticity of the product since I have always purchased brush heads from traditional brick &amp; mortar stores before.  </li>
            <li> I like that it comes with different colored rings at the base of the heads, as my wife and I share the same \\&quot;handle\\&quot; but different heads.</li>
            <li> Does not fit into the SONICARE</li>
            <li> Although my unit was listed as accomadating these heads, they did not fit.</li>
            <li> They seem firm and deliver the cleaning power to my teeth, gums, and tongue.</li>
            <li> The quality was poor and they lasted about 3 weeks when they are suppose to last 3 months.</li>
            <li> Inside the shaft they were missing the bump that snaps them in place on the toothbrush so the brush heads would fall off</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.......</li>
            <li> These brushheads did not properly fit my Sonic Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I know is it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The cap does not fit.  </li>
            <li> These did not fit my toothbrush trying to use the one I opened but the stem is not covered on my toothbrush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Philips Sonicare ProResults system for a few years now.</li>
            <li> Price keeps going up a few bucks each year.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend these as they are a waste of money.</li>
            <li> am now going to try generics; they cannot be worse and if they last 3 weeks each, I will be ahead.</li>
            <li> These also are not cheap.</li>
            <li> but i did find some to break at the bottom from mounting it on my toothbrush everyday</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;wear indicator\\&quot; is a scam, and shows need for replacement within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> No more of that up &amp; down bull.</li>
            <li> The items certainly looked like they were a Phillips product, but once I opened the package and started to use it - FAKE!  </li>
            <li> and now I have gone through 3 brush heads in less than 1 month!</li>
            <li> The real ones have serial numbers and the ProResults lettering looks different not to mention that the bristles are also long and seem to be cut terribly on these fakes.</li>
            <li> I purchased these &amp;#34;Philips&amp;#34; brand replacement heads rather than a &amp;#34;aftermarket&amp;#34; brand because I wanted the original brush heads that came with my base unit.  </li>
            <li> I used to brush with a plain toothbrush</li>
            <li> My husband and I have noticed a dramatic improvement in our dental visits since starting using the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I put the first one on my toothbrush, and found it odd that the cap was nearly impossible to remove, and the brush head had to be forced onto my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The price of these toothbrushes were signifantly less expensive than at Kohl&#x27;s where I initially was going to get them.</li>
            <li> These ones are also less expensive, which is a big plus too.</li>
            <li> They are Sonic replacements, but less expensive then I can get locally.</li>
            <li> These replacement brushes were less expensive than the same ones Sonicare offered with a discount.</li>
            <li> Also, one in the package was faulty and didn&#x27;t stay in the brush base for the full use time</li>
            <li> Because they&#x27;re loose on the base, the vibrations are really subdued</li>
            <li> Whenever you go with an Electric toothbrush they are always expensive but ordering them online always comes out a little cheaper especially through Amazon.</li>
            <li> One broke in half immediately and they others were hard to put on.</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves do not fit snug onto the base, but for the price, it was worth it.</li>
            <li> They did not fit properly and using them was difficult.  </li>
            <li> Not good for Elite, or other ones.</li>
            <li> Because the Sonicare cycle commits to a longer brushing I am hopeful that it will mean less cavities in my teeth.</li>
            <li> If the brush loosens the least little bit, the seal ring flops around.</li>
            <li> These are NOT authentic replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I need to change it once a month.</li>
            <li> Sonicare recommends that change the toothbrush head every 3 months, but I usually push it to 4 or 5 months.</li>
            <li> These specific heads formy sonicare are difficult to find in my area for under 26.00...</li>
            <li> These are NOT authentic.</li>
            <li> No more words.</li>
            <li> I only wish the brush heads weren&#x27;t so expensive.  </li>
            <li> After only one week of use, the bristles became frayed, spread out and useless.</li>
            <li> THEY WILL NOT FIT!</li>
            <li> Been using these brush heads for the past 4 years and every time I brush my teeth, It feels like if I got a cleaning done by a Dentist.</li>
            <li> It is too difficult to open.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they are ripoffs or if Philips changed the design.  </li>
            <li> Shipping took longer than usual...</li>
            <li> I do not know if these were a fake brand, or a reject set that was not sent to stores, but I would not purchase this same set again.</li>
            <li> This makes the product useless at transmitting vibrations and functioning as a proper &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; toothbrush should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure why the picture doesn&#x27;t state that.  </li>
            <li> But then again the seller usually does know his sources,</li>
            <li> I am not sure why they continue to sell these items at $10 per brush head, knowing they are an inferior product.</li>
            <li> We usually arm wrestle for it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shame on Amazon for listing &amp;#34;Philips&amp;#34; below the product name because they are definitely not authentic Philips products but rather counterfeit lookalikes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately from now on I will inconveniently only purchase my replacement brush heads from a brick and mortar store that also sells the Philips tooth brushes</li>
            <li> Each brush head in the past that I have purchased has lasted for the recommended 3 month change period without any issues.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, the first brush head I used failed to pass the test.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t ever write reviews</li>
            <li> Not sure I can return them but will be writing Sonicare..</li>
            <li> And were difficult to find locally.  </li>
            <li> brush heads didn&#x27;t last a week of use, started laying flat and became useless, a big disappointment!  </li>
            <li> They are also cut very unevenly.</li>
            <li> I started using an automatic tooth brush at the recommendation of my dentist who believed my gum recession was due to a history of poor brushing technique and inadequate flossing.  </li>
            <li> Poor oral health can lead to other health problems.  </li>
            <li> I hated having to disassemble and clean out the Advance.    </li>
            <li> Note that standard sized brush is $5.00 cheaper than mini-sized brush using the same attachment base.</li>
            <li> Iam not real happy with  the supplies  </li>
            <li> I was past the 3 months replacement for the brush heads, but I felt like it was not necessary as they get as bad as other brush</li>
            <li> The routes are not always logical, and sometimes really stupid.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had to deal with this Chinese dupe crap for a long time, but it&#x27;s bound to happen eventually.</li>
            <li> I hate writing my first product review as a negative one, but this needs to be said.</li>
            <li> This is a hard to find item because of all the types of electric toothbrushes out there.  </li>
            <li> They are hard to take on and off, since me and my husband share the motor and change the heads.  </li>
            <li> (and I do not brush my teeth hard).  </li>
            <li> The increased length on the neck of the brush head allows for easier access to the molar region of your mouth allowing you to get at those hard to reach places.   </li>
            <li> when you push too hard the noise gets louder ..</li>
            <li> I can tell you that I don&#x27;t brush hard</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t press to hard on your teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to say anything negative about it because it&#x27;s a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> At least that is my experience.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for 15+ years when you could only buy it from the vendor and it has changed for the worst as far as replacement time as well as brush head replacement.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> This is in contrast to the Elite heads which lasted me at least 4 to 6 months, even tho my tooth brushing regimen did not change.</li>
            <li> The bristles were not too painful or soft.</li>
            <li> I saved at least $10.00 buying them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> at least they&#x27;re supposed to be.</li>
            <li> It arrived shoddily wrapped in a piece of plastic, taped by scotch-tape.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this online rather than in the store because it&#x27;s at least $10 cheaper.  </li>
            <li> These fake ones are worse than any regular tooth brush I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I have been disappointed with them, I have not complained, but, now is the time.  </li>
            <li> Minus one star as it is a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> I guess the projected delivery date assumes delivery via a slow boat to/from China!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather spend money on toothbrushes than fillings or other expensive dental work.</li>
            <li> there are other reviews claiming that this product is fake.</li>
            <li> I may consider looking at other brands, which is sad after 20+ years of loyalty.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money!!</li>
            <li> They are extremely soft and won&#x27;t snap attach to the base unit unlike the past ones.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very difficult to open the sealed plastic package.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not worth saving money if the product is useless.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this purchase and wished I had looked earlier instead of waiting to use them because I would have asked for my money back.  </li>
            <li> and I worry that it was the fake toothbrush heads that were wearing my gums down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be very disappointed if a number of these are defective like the first one!</li>
            <li> The battery on my previous Sonicare, the Elite model, started to fail.  </li>
            <li> The price seems ridiculous.</li>
            <li> less expensive.</li>
            <li> I think there are a lot of fake Chinese sonicare heads to be wary of.</li>
            <li> Just wish they were less expensive.</li>
            <li> I could have gone to &amp;#34;the Walmart&amp;#34; and purchased something less expensive.</li>
            <li> I have serious doubts about authenticity of this product.</li>
            <li> The brush head does not fit on the base properly.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the brush heads are expensive when purchased through local retailers.  </li>
            <li> But just a little bit expensive.</li>
            <li> A little difficult to pull the head off though.</li>
            <li> Brushes are a little expensive.</li>
            <li> I gave a review but reviewed wrong product a few minutes ago.</li>
            <li> So it not a good indication of when the brush needs to be replaced.</li>
            <li> but it really is not as good as using a sonicare.</li>
            <li> These were not genuine  but a fake.</li>
            <li> the brush head is not good price for Philips.</li>
            <li> :  problem was solved once i just got rid of the plastic ring tho and placed the head directly on the base.  </li>
            <li> This pack each brush does not really fir into the base as it did from the previous pack.</li>
            <li> First time buyer this brushes and very disappointed of a quality.</li>
            <li> Like other recent reviewers, I am very disappointed in these brush heads.</li>
            <li> Perhaps this was just a bad batch but none of the three that came in the package have stayed on the brush for long.</li>
            <li> , I can not say it enough how disappointed I am with these toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> with other fakes manufactured in questionable countries who knows what else may be wrong with these brush heads.....</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t snap onto my Sonicare toothbrush and the bristles are weak and spread out.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if i&#x27;m just using the heads wrong</li>
            <li> The base of the head does not go on easily, and when you remove the brush head from the brush, the base will separate and remain stuck on the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I removed a buildup of hard water deposits from the stem and that helped, but they&#x27;re still difficult to set and remove.</li>
            <li> Hopefully my days of not replacing my brush on the correct schedule are behind me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;s brush have a big gab between the rubber and the base.</li>
            <li> To me, this points to Philips lacking confidence in their product design and poor warranty program.</li>
            <li> The only nit is the the rubber moisture seal ring between the brush base and the removeable brush has no recess to seat it.  </li>
            <li> anyone help please, I am confused</li>
            <li> These brush heads are softer and poor quality.</li>
            <li> This happens OVER and OVER until you just finally give up trying to make it stay on the base</li>
            <li> So convenient to find them at Amazon, was so tired of driving around town and asking everywhere</li>
            <li> but brush head vibrates off and bristles are softer and poorly cut.</li>
            <li> Bristles poor.</li>
            <li> THIS IS FALSE ADVERTISING!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Very disappointed that one brush was a tiny child&#x27;s brush - so small I threw it out.  </li>
            <li> I do like the way the bristles change color when it&#x27;s time to replace them -- too bad it cost so much to do so :(.</li>
            <li> I saw a dramatic decline in cavities and plaque.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The brush head has faded print on it saying &amp;#34;ProResults&amp;#34; and the base of it, when I set it down on a counter without the base of the brush, is crooked.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed because these aren&#x27;t cheap :(</li>
            <li> Being the Sonicare brand I expected no problems, but one of the heads wouldn&#x27;t stay clicked on the brush base and fell off when it started vibrating.</li>
            <li> There are so hard they are killing my gums!!</li>
            <li> I will loose money as I will have needless base unit - but hey these brushes are leaving a hole my pocket and wanted to stop cavities.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that a few of the bristles fell off within a week of use.  </li>
            <li> , there was about a half inch gap between the bottom of the brush and the base.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads were worthless and have flattened out in less than a week so that they are no longer useable.</li>
            <li> but the replacement heads came with the little colored rings too to go between the base and the head.  </li>
            <li> Like another buyer here, I bought heads at Target and the difference is startling.</li>
            <li> What did we do wrong?</li>
            <li> Sorry about me.</li>
            <li> and I think they replacement heads are way too expensive.  </li>
            <li> But, we were  wrong.</li>
            <li> You know you need to change it when it gets all twisted.  </li>
            <li> They are really expensive though.</li>
            <li> Because the tooth brush itself is expensive.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, these brushes look and work well and came well packaged.  </li>
            <li> After logging onto Amazon and seeing some complaints about sellers selling fake sonicare toothbrush heads, I was leery of purchasing anything online.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY -- these appear to be fake.  </li>
            <li> I was unable to find these replacement brushes anywhere.  </li>
            <li> I bought the set sold by jinlan inc and they are 100% fake.</li>
            <li> These brush heads appear to be fake.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads do the job, but it always amazes me how expensive they are.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just bummed that they are so expensive.  </li>
            <li> Seems unfair that to take care of your teeth they charge you and arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> This was extremely disappointing as I have never experienced this with a Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Why so expensive?  </li>
            <li> This is NOT NICE!!!</li>
            <li> These are usually ridiculously expensive.</li>
            <li> fake brush heads.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush is expensive enough at $140, having to change the brush head every 3 months is very expensive!!!!  </li>
            <li> , it is difficult to remember to change your heads</li>
            <li> Maybe I ordered the wrong size??</li>
            <li> I have given 4 stars because these brushes are expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard others say they are too expensive</li>
            <li> WEREN&#x27;T SO EXPENSIVE, BUT</li>
            <li> These are defective or fake toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> This is clearly a FAKE product...</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t understand why they are so expensive to begin with.</li>
            <li> still too expensive.</li>
            <li> biggest problem with these heads is that they are generally expensive.</li>
            <li> Needless to say ended up returning it.</li>
            <li> you sold a FAKE</li>
            <li> So basically even if you do decide to return these fake tooth brush heads you will be losing money on shipping.</li>
            <li> These are fake brush heads that fray after 2-3 uses.</li>
            <li> Thsee are fake.</li>
            <li> Thickness of the &amp;#34;neck&amp;#34; is wrong, font is wrong size and pixelated where it says &amp;#34;ProResults&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> , maybe it is the wrong brand</li>
            <li> it was a fake, a very poor copy.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> No more crap building up inside the toothbrush.    </li>
            <li> if you have to pay shipping, they are CRAZY expensive.</li>
            <li> But what isn&#x27;t crazy expensive nowadays.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy how expensive the toothbrush was to begin with</li>
            <li> they are just too expensive, sorry Amazon baught a 5pck at Sams for 36 bucks, you cant beat that!</li>
            <li> anyways, I felt kinda crazy, but I called Amazon to return them and since I already opened it they just gave me a refund, but I still think it is awful and a waste of my time to buy fake products online.</li>
            <li> I have to hold onto the brush head to keep it intact with makes my finger numb B)</li>
            <li> Really disappointing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so expensive!</li>
            <li> We were sorely disappointed to find out that these brush heads are fake and a knock off.</li>
            <li> Counterfeit and fake do not buy!</li>
            <li> The quality is really poor!!</li>
            <li> These toothbrush heads are fake!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate for me because I will do what it take to use the toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t merely walk away from these...run!</li>
            <li> It is very weird.  </li>
            <li> But something was very wrong about these brush heads.</li>
            <li> And too bad for Philips because now I&#x27;m reconsidering another purchase with them.</li>
            <li> How could this be any bad?</li>
            <li> before I opened the package, I had a bad feeling.</li>
            <li> I would like to say that I got a bad package, but I purchased (3) three packs</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know what else to type to tell how bad was...</li>
            <li> , these would go bad after a day.  </li>
            <li> Again, it is probably just a bad batch</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand of toothbrush for about 5-6 years and have yet to be disappointed</li>
            <li> I am very UNhappy</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Again stupid that I have word requirement.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning it was also a pain because crap would get stuck up inside it</li>
            <li> The ring at the base won&#x27;t stay on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This item fits the Sonicare base (HX6950)</li>
            <li> fits the base.</li>
            <li> They are absolutely worthless; do NOT buy.</li>
            <li> Not a lot, but annoying.</li>
            <li> That makes brushing very difficult!  </li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED.  </li>
            <li> Fake.... !!!  </li>
            <li> How horrible can a company be.  </li>
            <li> If you hold the brush on with a finger it works, but it&#x27;s very annoying.</li>
            <li> These are, quite frankly, terrible.</li>
            <li> These heads are terrible!!  </li>
            <li> absolutely horrible.</li>
            <li> These were of the worst quality.  </li>
            <li> This is horrible.  </li>
            <li> And, the worst part is that I purchased 2 packs of these at once, so I am now out $36.50!  </li>
            <li> They are horrible.  </li>
            <li> I was really disappointed!!</li>
            <li> These Philips Sonicare hx6013 brush heads are terrible...</li>
            <li> It was very annoying.</li>
            <li> I purchased these replacements and they are the worst toothbrushes I have ever owned...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These were very brittle and did not last for even a month. Do not buy these cheap knock-offs!</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly.  No issues.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re doing the trick. Great for the price! Will reorder again when necessary.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t fit on my Sonicare handle properly.  They are loose (and consequently vibrate too much) and eventually these loosened up so much that the heads vibrated off of the handle and into my mouth.  I literally couldn&#x27;t brush my teeth.  Authentic replacement heads do not perform this way.  These are NOT authentic replacement heads.</li>
            <li> They attach correctly and work as well as they should.  Not really much else to say about this product is there?</li>
            <li> These newer design heads only last ~3 months of use for me (used 2-3 times a day).  Heads for my older style brush with larger diameter handle (ni-cad battery powered) lasted 4+ months.</li>
            <li> Phillips is the man.  Cleans my teeth quite well.  No more of that up &amp; down bull. The high speed vibrations knock the socks off plaque.</li>
            <li> My teeth are clean...?</li>
            <li> These brush heads dont fit (to tight) my Philips Sonicare Flexcare Plus, they come apart when you try to remove them.</li>
            <li> I picked this rating because the brush heads fit .  I heat going to a store to buy these because I live out in the country and it makes life easier to order them .  I had no problems with the brush heads and they came very fast after I had order them.</li>
            <li> Bought them for my FlexCare, it&#x27;s the same type as the one that came with the toothbrush. These heads have always been pricy but it&#x27;s still cheaper than having dental cavities treated, which happens a lot to me before I switched to Sonicare. The only downside is Amazon only offers every 6 month subscribe and save option when 3 heads could last you a total of 9 months at 3 months per head. So I can&#x27;t really take advantage of the discount.</li>
            <li> Do NOT buy this product. The brush head only last for about two weeks and it won&#x27;t completely not useable. I ended up getting new brush heads at target. They have way better quality then these. I have a picture and will upload later.</li>
            <li> We have used the various versions of Sonicare for perhaps 15 years. This one does a good job, but we had one brush (so far) that would not stay on the motor. We phoned Sonicare and they sent us two more. So all is well as long as it is not a common problem</li>
            <li> This is the third Philips Sonicare toothbrush I have purchased, the first through AMAZON,  and I find it excellent. It effectibely removes all plaque and is compact and easy to use. I love the fact that it stays charged for at least 10 days, making it easy to travel without worry. I recommend this product to anyone who wants to preserve the health of his teeth and gums.    Flexcare    Brush 465 usages fit perfectly and do the job well.</li>
            <li> Purchased a set of replacement brush heads when I purchased a new Sonicare. Always good to have spares. The Sonicare was a replacement for an older model that I had used for about 10 years. The new model is much better.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare electric toothbrushes for years; in fact, this Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush will be my third Sonicare.    The battery on my previous Sonicare, the Elite model, started to fail.  And you can&#x27;t just replace a battery.  So after quite a bit of mumbling I bought this FlexCare.  Is it any better than the Elite?  I don&#x27;t know, because I liked the Elite too.    The good news is that because the toothbrush portion of the unit is so much simpler, a replacement pack of three FlexCare toothbrush heads costs less than what I paid for a two pack of Elite replacement heads.</li>
            <li> If you have a Philips Sonicare toothbrush, then you are stuck with buying these, which are NOT cheap by any means. Philips say you should change them as soon as the blue marker disappears...YEAH RIGHT! If you are careful with your brush heads, they should LAST WAY MORE than what the marker indicates! This marker is just there so that Philips can make money out of you by replacing a FULLY FUNCTIONAL head with a new one. Don&#x27;t fall in this trap, as I have found that these heads are very well made and durable. I recommend them!</li>
            <li> I love these Sonicare brushes and they work well, I will plan on continue to use my Sonicare system all the time.</li>
            <li> These brush heads arrived promptly and are exactly like what I would normally buy at my local bb&amp;b.  I love the sonicare toothbrush, they really keep my teeth thoroughly clean. Change every 3 months, you can tell when they aren&#x27;t cleaning as well. I write it on the calendar.</li>
            <li> These obviously are designed for the Phiilips Toothbrush, the excellent toothbrush by Phillips, who produce the toothbrush that is like having your own Dental Hygienist in your bathroom.</li>
            <li> I have a few sensitive issues with my gums.  However, these toothbrush heads are great for me and I don&#x27;t have any issues even with my smaller sized mouth.</li>
            <li> These are the exact brand brush heads and are a great deal.  These are quite expensive, but the price with Amazon was much more affordable.</li>
            <li> No complaints, item as described.  Priced lower than what I can find it for locally.</li>
            <li> These brush heads, along with my Phillips Sonicare HealthyWhite toothbrush, make for a thorough, dentist like clean every time. The brush heads are stiff enough to get a great clean, but soft enough to be gentle on the gums. I make it a point to go over my gums each time I brush my teeth and not once have my gums hurt or been irritated by these brush heads. I feel like my mouth isn&#x27;t clean unless I use my Phillips HealthyWhite with these brush heads.  The two drawbacks are (1) the high price of these brush heads and (2) the longevity of each brush head. The price seems ridiculous. It couldn&#x27;t cost more than a few bucks to manufacture these in mass quantities. Also, the brush heads do not last 3 months before replacement as described. With daily use the brush heads probably last around 2 months at best. Either way, they are worth it. 4 out of 5 stars because of the two drawbacks mentioned above.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for my son, recommended by his dentist. He enjoys the thorough cleaning, almost as if a hygienist cleaned his teeth.</li>
            <li> Better check with Walmart.  They sell this same item for $20 (as of the date this was written).  The power unit for these Brush Heads only cost $82 (amazon).</li>
            <li> Great product. Great pricing.   I love my Sonicare toothbrush. Replacement heads are very expensive in the stores, but more reasonable on Amazon.   They last a good while, I have found that they don&#x27;t last very long if you do the ultralight cleaning too often.</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare in fifteen years, and it has improved considerably.  It is lightweight yet sturdy and very effective, especially with whitening toothpaste. Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare brush for five years. I used to have elite 9500 with screwed in brush heads. They worked fine but these Proresult snap ons are better. After every brush my teeth feel cleaner. Certainly I am saving trips to dentist.  My wife use the same brush heads and very happy with the result. We both have Flexcare HX6911. They don&#x27;t come with UV sanitizer. We thought they are not necessary, cleaning with water is enough.  We got the best prize from Amazon and free shipping, can&#x27;t ask more.</li>
            <li> I researched these tooth brush heads, Amazon had the best value, no tax, free shipping.  I have used an electric toothbrush for years, and get good reports from my dentist.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re still using an old fashioned toothbrush, you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re missing.  Once you start brushing with these Sonicare brushes, you&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
            <li> Arrived early &amp; fit perfectly! Super cheap &amp; convenient compared to purchasing from Dentist or Store. Would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Received earlier than expected day.  No problem</li>
            <li> These are the same brush heads that come when you buy your toothbrush new, they work fine and fit the sonicare flexcare perfectly</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with this product. My original brush head lasted me 3 months like it should and I ordered this to replace it. Within a month, the bristles for these began to wear out. At first, I thought I was being too aggressive with my brushing so I eased up, but when the second brush started wearing out again, I knew this was not a good product.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using this product and would buy it again.  Works as described. Amazon is very competent and the Phillips Sonicare toothbrush was sent quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li> Have been using this type dental care for years.</li>
            <li> These are replacement brush heads for the fine Philips Sonicare tooth brush.  I&#x27;ve been getting about 3 months&#x27;usage out of each of the brushes.  They are very good at cleaning your teeth.  I wish Philips would come up with improved packaging.  It&#x27;s very difficult to open the sealed plastic package.</li>
            <li> I had to buy the replacement brush heads since mine fell on the floor and broke. It went down 3 feet and landed on carpet. Who would have guessed it. They are not made very well, especially for the cost! As much as I love my Sonicare toothbrush when these heads run out I will replace the toothbrush...not the heads.</li>
            <li> What else can you say about a toothbrush that goes with the Sonicare Maxicare Toothbrush.  Just the best they can be.</li>
            <li> I got this after my very old Sonicare finally kicked the bucket.  It&#x27;s quite, smaller, comes with a UV sanitizer and has different modes for whatever floats your boat.  I&#x27;m not to fond of the \\&quot;massage\\&quot; function, which can be used separately or comes in intervals during the \\&quot;max care\\&quot; mode but I love it.   As for these brushes, you won&#x27;t find them cheaper anywhere else so that&#x27;s all I can really say.</li>
            <li> these are real Philips heads and cheapest price around.</li>
            <li> Definitely knock-offs - these do not fit as well on my Sonicare HX6733 as the OEM brushes did. Also, the brush heads don&#x27;t feel quite right too. I&#x27;m going to buy these at Costco going forward.</li>
            <li> Works great, easy to change. Only takes a few seconds.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re happy with these brush heads, and the price is exactly half of what we saw at Costco!  Philips have come up with a solid product here, but remember to replace the brush heads every three months to keep it working its best.  At this price, it&#x27;s doable!</li>
            <li> We feel that this product does a good job cleaning our teeth.  We checked around and feel that we receive the best price/shipping with Amazon.  We alternate days brushing with Braun Oral-B and feel that the combination of the two electric tooth brushes does a good job.</li>
            <li> This was equivalent to the original brush head I received with the Sonic Care HX6530 ProResults.  I did not install the color bands they sent because I don&#x27;t think the brush seats as well with them (I never installed them when I bought the toothbrush new at BJ&#x27;s wholesale, it came with 2 toothbrushes and charger bases).</li>
            <li> This is a hard to find item because of all the types of electric toothbrushes out there.  Price is good.</li>
            <li> These are to big to get things clean and they are pricy.</li>
            <li> These are perfect refill brush-heads (Standard) for the Philips Sonicare FlexCare. I bought the 3-pack along with my Philips Sonicare FlexCare and am very pleased with both the unit and the replacement brush heads. I prefer the Standard heads over the Compact heads as they are still relatively petite, but cover more tooth-surface and gum area when brushing. This is a great purchase at a great price for a well-made sonic toothbrush unit.</li>
            <li> I noticed some people complained that these were cheap imitations of actual Sonicare toothbrushes, but I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference. They work well and I do not think they are too soft.</li>
            <li> Purchased for about 1/2 the price on along lasting good cleaning toothbrushes &amp; got them quick with low shipping cost.</li>
            <li> Sonicare is a good system but the brush head 3 pack is $10 too expensive.</li>
            <li> These are bigger than the brush that the sonic care comes with.  I feel like they do a better job of cleaning my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> if you have to pay shipping, they are CRAZY expensive. even if you don&#x27;t pay shipping, they are way too expensive for what they are, but if you own and use this excellent tooth brush- what&#x27;re you gonna do?</li>
            <li> I recommend that everyone get this toothbrush, then when you need replacement heads, buy from Amazon.  I searched at COSTCO Warehouse Club and did an online price comparison.  You can&#x27;t beat the deal Amazon gives you when you sign up for the automatic shipment that delivers new brush heads every three months.  I saved money, got free shipping and I don&#x27;t have to waste my time and gas running around purchasing the replacement heads.  Thank you AMAZON!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great refill pack for the Sonicare toothbrush and much cheaper then buying it in a store.  The seller was great, very fast in getting it shipped.</li>
            <li> great deal on these with the subscribe and save offer. The other B&amp;M stores in the area have it for a lot more.</li>
            <li> This system worked!  My dental hygienst is increasing the spacing of my cleanings since I started using this product.  It is definitely better than the oral B.</li>
            <li> My wife is a fervent user of this toothbrush but everywhere we looked in town, the replacement heads weren&#x27;t available. It was terrific to get them so easily through Amazon. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Husband really needed these!</li>
            <li> This was great, I was looking for replacement heads for our electric toothbrush.  This gave me the right info to know it&#x27;s what I needed.  And best of all a super low price, half of some places!</li>
            <li> I was having a problem identifying the correct brush when purchasing at a drug store or at Fry&#x27;s so I am very pleased being able to have the brushes delivered on a predictable schedule but the confidence that I am going to receive the correct product that matches my machine.  Hopefully my days of not replacing my brush on the correct schedule are behind me.</li>
            <li> I suspect that these are knock-offs and not true Sonicare heads based on their short life and poor construction. Like another buyer here, I bought heads at Target and the difference is startling.</li>
            <li> Loose fit and pulls off easily</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves do not fit snug onto the base, but for the price, it was worth it. The blue indicator seems a little lighter than my previous one but it still gets the job done.  Overall, not a bad price for brush head replacements.</li>
            <li> I have had this sonic toothbrush forever and really like it, the heads work great they are just too expensive, sorry Amazon baught a 5pck at Sams for 36 bucks, you cant beat that! great brushheads though:)</li>
            <li> This is the only brush head that is compatible with my Philips FlexCare 900 series toothbrush.  The brush heads are not readily available at my local drugstore or discount stores.  It wasn&#x27;t even available at the Philips online store.  Also, it was definitely the best price I found with my online search--I didn&#x27;t have to pay postage.  The same price can be found on the Walmart online store but they charge for postage.  Also, the delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li> In order to qualify for the rebate and the free replacement head you have to return an original receipt and an original UPC symbol from the package.  No copies accepted!  Customer Service Representative suggested that if it were given as a gift I should have ask for original copies of receipts.   No suggest for the original UPC gifen for a gift.  Imagine that with online purchase and used for a gift.  How horrible can a company be.  Obviously, they do not want to honor any rebates or free replacement heads.  And to think I purchased five for gifts.</li>
            <li> We love this toothbrush. It actually does make your teeth a little whiter and leaves a very clean feeling.</li>
            <li> The head supposed to last for 3 months, but with me it lasts 2-3 weeks only. I brush 2-3 times a day.  It does an OK job in cleaning, but not much stain removal.</li>
            <li> This 3 pack of replacement brush heads works perfectly with my Philips Sonicare Proresults. It&#x27;s a standard item that you can find anywhere, but I found the best price here. It&#x27;d be great if Philips Sonicare offered different size heads or bristle types.</li>
            <li> Got here in a timely matter, they are what they are advertised to be, and the price is good.</li>
            <li> Sonicare makes an amazing electric toothbrush... buy-in is pretty costly $100+ ... then there&#x27;s the brush heads that need to be replaced regularly, every 3 months (recommended)... at $20+ per 3-pack... however it&#x27;s better than having to get cavities filled and plaque scraped off your teeth by the dentist so it&#x27;s all mostly worth it in the end.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended electric toothbrush - I get these on Subscribe and Save so they get changed every 3 months.  I have used other electric toothbrushes which I do not like as much as Sonicare.  If you want healthy teeth and gums, this is the place to start (also floss and pre-rinse help too!).</li>
            <li> If you price power toothbrush heads, sonicare floats to the top everywhere among brands.  I&#x27;ve used other brands [cheaper] and found you get what you pay for in cleaning effectiveness.  Also in terms of longevity, the philips system heads last longer, on the order of 4 months where some \\&quot;bargain brand\\&quot; heads are lucky at 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course all varies with technique.  If you are closing your mouth on the brush you are in for a shock on the back side but also smashing the bristles down.  I found I was doing this alot until I got the philips system which broke me of that habbit (dentists call it chewing your brush).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also make it a habit to rinse the brush in Deionized water then place it into the UV sterilizer after use.  This seems to remove all contaminates and kill any bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Size is a matter of preference.  The large heads get the job done faster, but if you had your wisdom teeth removed due to space issues, the small head may be needed to get behind your last molar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, sonicare&#x27;s plastic appears to be virgin (no regrind added to the mix) which in this day of injection molding is a rare item to find.  I sectioned an old brush and looked for signs of regrind additives and could no find one spek in the whole brush-head shaft 45 degree cut using polarized light and a 100x microscope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is also offering a good price compared to other sources, so I have to say this is overall a good product at a good price, and if treated properly it could last a year.</li>
            <li> Best price anywhere that I could find, I \\&quot;subscribed\\&quot; since this is an item that needs renewing every now and then, and ended up saving 40% off regular store prices! YAY!</li>
            <li> I like to brush my teeth atleast once a week and these brushes are perfect for me!</li>
            <li> Bought these toothbrush heads to replace the one that I had. They fit perfectly and the price was one of the cheapest I found online. Make sure the toothbrush heads are compatable with your actual toothbrush and your cant go far wrong.</li>
            <li> An electric toothbrush is only as helpful in keeping your teeth clean as the status of the brush head. Change it when needed!</li>
            <li> I love my Phillips toothbrush and the toothbrush heads! Feels like I just left the dentist every time I brush.</li>
            <li> These things can be a little difficult to find and when you find them they cost more than double the price. They are a perfect toothbrush , long lasting and durable. I&#x27;ve been using them for a year now and my teeth are healthy as ever.</li>
            <li> It is important to replace your Sonicare electric toothbrush heads about every 3 months so the brushing will remain effect at cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li> Love the sonicare toothbrush system.  My wife and I have had this system for 2 years now and only have to replace brusheads every 6 months.  The toothbrush works great and the results are noticed by our dentist.  Thanks Sonicare!</li>
            <li> This pack of 3 is good for this year. Seems the brush heads last about 3 months, and even though I would prefer 4 to a pack, 3 will do. Perhaps look into 4 to a pack for it&#x27;s a years supply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so expensive! Philips, lower the cost please. I feel like the cost of my toothbrush gets higher after every year. I&#x27;m a college student and I spend more money on my toothbrush then on school!     Well, it does.. feel more clean.</li>
            <li> HX6013 ProResult tooth brush head burshes tooth well. 6013 Larger brush head than 6023. Both work well. I alternate them. 6023 maybe better for guns. 6013 covers more of teeth area.</li>
            <li> I and my wife had been using the sonic toothbrush now for about 5 years. It is very easy to use and we both love it. It make our teeth feel very clean and fresh every day and night and we have not been having much trouble with our oral health at all. We have been buying the replacement brushes at costco but I just found out this great price on Amazon. Will start getting these here since its the best deal we can find.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of Sonicare toothbrushes. Brushing teeth has never been so much fun. My teeth health and color have improved since using Sonicare. These brushes are comfortable to use and hold up to all of the brushing minutes. I&#x27;m a believer!</li>
            <li> I own the Philips Sonicare that calls for these replacements which my husband and I like very much.  I could not find the replacements in our local stores so was delighted to see that they were available on line.  They arrived in good condition and in the time promised.</li>
            <li> These brush heads work great on my FlexCare+ toothbrush. The bottom of my brush has HX6950 on the bottom of it, hopefully that helps anybody looking for replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;These brushes work well and through a combination of better care and using this toothbrush, I&#x27;ve had better visits with my dentist and hygenist.</li>
            <li> They do their job just fine.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush heads work fine.  They are hard to take on and off, since me and my husband share the motor and change the heads.  Just a little extra muscle to make it work.  I love sonicare.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product and how quickly I received it. The toothbrush heads are just as described. The packaging wasn&#x27;t damaged at all and arrived very promptly!</li>
            <li> Want to have squeaky clean - just had a cleaning @ the dentist clean.  Well, this is for you!</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with receiving my Sonicare Brush Head in the mail. It helps me to remember to change the heads on time and the price is very reasonable compared to shopping in stores. This item does not go on sale very often and having it locked in to a regular price and delivered to my door is very nice!</li>
            <li> Shipped super fast (actually, it arrived before Amazon suggested which was super cool with the Christmas holiday being a factor), and was exactly as advertised...  Will order again.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I checked many local and internet stores and couldn&#x27;t find this item for a better price.  Also, shipping was fast and you&#x27;re buying from Amazon so you know it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> If this is anything like the original brush head that came with the Sonicare system, these will work beautifully. I was told to change brush heads every three months, so I will follow up in three months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these many times, but the ones I just opened are such soft bristles I tossed them in 1-week!</li>
            <li> Once I used a Sonicare Toothbrush, I can not go back to a regular toothbrush. My teeth feel so much cleaner with Sonicare and I know I&#x27;m brushing every area of my teeth for thirty seconds. Amazon provided me with the best price and I signed up to receive automatic shipments of new brushes &amp; this is so convenient. I have purchased many items from Amazon and never been disappointed, also, I take advantage of free shipping with a $25.00 or more order.</li>
            <li> First, the tooth brush is hard. I am not sure if hard is supposed to be more effective. I prefer soft toothbrush. I do not think they have soft ones for sonicare available  Second, the instruction on the box shows it is time to change toothbrush when the indicating brush change from blue to white. Dentists suggest changing toothbrush every three months. But the indicating brush changed from blue to white within a month. I am not sure if I need to change it once a month.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re buying replacement brush heads for a toothbrush you already own, why are you even reading these reviews?</li>
            <li> I was past the 3 months replacement for the brush heads, but I felt like it was not necessary as they get as bad as other brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received this new tooth brushes I could feel a HUGE difference! I could tell how stiffer they were compared to my older brush. I even feel my teeth cleaner for much longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely love them! With subscribe and save, there is no cheaper price around!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t go past the 3 months usage, it really decreases the quality of your oral cleaning.</li>
            <li> These heads are a lot better than the off brand heads.</li>
            <li> This is a decent product for the system. It works good for us and we would buy from again. Thanks for a quality item.</li>
            <li> These brush heads last longer than my regular toothbrushes ever did.  Even though it is recommended to change them every 2-3 months, I have used mine much longer because they don&#x27;t show signs of wear until the 4th or 5th month.  At least that is my experience.  If you get on the subscriber program, the price is better than what you would pay anywhere else.</li>
            <li> The heads were great except for one. It has 1/2 inch crack in the shaft. Maybe I could get a new one. Yes?</li>
            <li> I bought a set of Philips Sonicare Pro last year with 3 pk brush head. They fit to my base ok. This pack each brush does not really fir into the base as it did from the previous pack. Both my husband and I&#x27;s brush have a big gab between the rubber and the base. The power was shut off soon too.  What did we do wrong?</li>
            <li> Have been using Sonicare products for years since my dentist recommended them.  The system works well and their products are of the highest quality.</li>
            <li> Just like the originals</li>
            <li> They are toothbrush heads... what can you say about a toothbrush head?  The comment is not about the toothbrush heads but about the convenience of having them delivered automatically on a regularly scheduled basis.  This, in turn, forces me to remember when to change the heads as recommended by Philips.  Good for my dental health (and, at my age my teeth are about the only thing that still works right!)</li>
            <li> I love that you can change out the rings on the bottom for other colors, so you always know whose is whose. And the feature where the bristles change color when it&#x27;s time for a new brush head, is a definite plus. Sometimes these heads are a little difficult to attach to the main unit at first; once I thought I bought the wrong heads for it! But after the first few times, they start going on much easier.</li>
            <li> Fell apart in a year - thre away!</li>
            <li> Amazon has the cheapest price I&#x27;ve found for these toothbrush heads anywhere. Love my Sonicare brush and these replacement heads!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these replacement brushes for my Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush for over 2 years at retail stores before discovering Amazon&#x27;s incredible price.    Both the toothbrush and the brush heads work well, but contrary to Philips&#x27; claims, I don&#x27;t see any way they could last 3-months long without losing their effectiveness.    I replace mine each time the light blue indicator bristles near the top of the brush head goes down, which is roughly once a month.</li>
            <li> The price of these toothbrushes were signifantly less expensive than at Kohl&#x27;s where I initially was going to get them.</li>
            <li> First off, Sonicare makes the best toothbrushes around. I&#x27;ve been using Sonicares for years and they are simply the best toothbrushes available.    The Sonicare ProResults brush heads are great, and a huge improvement over the old design. The old design tended to accumulate water, toothpaste residual, and saliva inside it, which would then crust and get nasty if you didn&#x27;t clean it regularly. Cleaning it was also a pain because crap would get stuck up inside it and you&#x27;d need to fish it out with a q-tip or something.    The Sonicare ProResults brush heads improve on the old design by having a simple joint to connect it to the toothbrush. No more crap building up inside the toothbrush.    Sonicare recommends that change the toothbrush head every 3 months, but I usually push it to 4 or 5 months. A cleaning tip would be to always remove the toothbrush head from the toothbrush itself, rinse it with some water, then let it sit on a clean paper towel to dry.</li>
            <li> Nice value for the price. I just purchased the toothbrush about 2 months ago and absolutely love its&#x27; features. I do approximately 75% of my shopping at warehouse clubs which is where I made my initial toothbrush purchase. They did not sell replacement brush heads however, so I did an online Google search and after much comparison shopping found them at an affordable price from an Amazon.com vendor. They&#x27;re much cheaper than brushheads for my old Sonicare Elite which ran about $40.00 for a pack of 3. After many years of purchasing those brushheads, I thought I&#x27;d died and gone to heaven when I saw the price for these brushheads! The toothbrush itself is more updated,streamlined,efficient, feature laden and fun to use so I thought the cost of replacement brushheads would be more than the $40.00 I used to pay for those for the Sonicare Elite. Wrong!!!Again, excellent value for the price.</li>
            <li> When I buy these at the drugstore,I pay almost three times as much, I highly recommend this item for people who use sonicare replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love this 900 Series toothbrush even though the heads are rather expensive. But is anyone else having problems with the metal stem loosening and making noise? The original was purchased in 8/09. Philips replaced it within the 2yr warranty period on 1/11. Now the second handle has failed for the exact same issue 15 months later (6/12). Although the warranty is clear on the ORIGINAL date of purchase, it seems to me that Philips wouldn&#x27;t want to replace this handle and start a new warrant period. I was told that no company extends their warranties or starts a new one based on a reoccurring problem. To me, this points to Philips lacking confidence in their product design and poor warranty program. Sorry about me. And too bad for Philips because now I&#x27;m reconsidering another purchase with them.</li>
            <li> I had difficulty finding the correct brushes in the store I purchased the Sonicare Electric toothbrush.  I had to do a web search and found that they were sold on Amazon.  They are exactly what we needed.</li>
            <li> Sonicare has been a leading product for a long time and I can confidently say it has provided me with great results. I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare for a little over 12 years.My dentist confirms that my dental health is among the best in his practice.      It&#x27;s very easy to use and the new design is much lighter than it&#x27;s older models.</li>
            <li> These specific heads formy sonicare are difficult to find in my area for under 26.00...this was a great buy and the seller preformed perfectly.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I ordered the correct refills but I just pushed them in securely and they fit.  Great brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this exact same product in the past and it worked perfectly. I have a flexcare toothbrush (one listed on the package that it&#x27;s compatible with) and this time around it did not fit at all, there was about a half inch gap between the bottom of the brush and the base. I&#x27;m returning it and now I need to figure out where I can find a product that fits.</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare Brush Heads are some of the most expensive to replace and Amazon.com has the best deal. Since these always need to be replaced, you can save an extra 15% with \\&quot;Subscribe and Save.\\&quot; By taking advantage of this, you can also decide how often to have them replaced, so you don&#x27;t even have to remember to reorder. Not only this, but shipping is free! It&#x27;s totally convenient - delivered right to you - and a better price than picking them up at a local store.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for my Sonicare toothbrush. Fits like OEM (because it is OEM). No complaints. I always go to amazon for these things because of the added savings (no tax, free shipping, etc) and without the need to run down to my local big box store and pay 20% more for a product I know I can get online for cheaper.    THANKS AMAZON!</li>
            <li> This is not the official Philips product.  It appears to be, but it doesn&#x27;t fit quite right on the toothbrush and after using it for a while, it just pops right off.  Buy the Philips heads from your dentist to be certain.</li>
            <li> the only one drawback for this package is they dont&#x27; come with the color ring for each head, so it will get confuse sometimes if i have more than 2 brushes at home</li>
            <li> I ordered the replacement brush heads for my Sonicare.  I have bought before, but Amazon had the best price then any other place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received this item faster and for less money than if I&#x27;d bought it here in Canada... even if I did pay the custom taxes...</li>
            <li> Bristles are VERY soft, not like the normal Standard bristles i&#x27;ve been using for two years. Also the head does not snap onto the handle. After less than one week of use, the bristles are all bent out of shape.</li>
            <li> these got to me quickly and were less expensive than the ones in target.  yay.</li>
            <li> Came quick. It&#x27;s good to buy these in bulk. They come with the different color rings so you can differentiate when sharing the toothbrush handle between users.</li>
            <li> These are the same thing that comes with the brush and they work just like the originals. Sonicare/philips do a great job with their electric toothbrush line.</li>
            <li> as expected , good product , recommended.</li>
            <li> Compared to the previous brush heads which would ACTUALLY last 3 months.  These do not.&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare wants us to buy more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new top of the line brush for Flexcare is $35 for 3.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how long they last yet as I&#x27;ve not tried them, BUT this HX6013/90 brush head DOES NOT at 7.00 per head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for 15+ years when you could only buy it from the vendor and it has changed for the worst as far as replacement time as well as brush head replacement.&lt;br /&gt;My first Sonicare lasted 8 years.&lt;br /&gt;Now, to one which will last 2 years is a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The prices have more than doubled since my first one.</li>
            <li> Sonicare Flexcare beats all other toothbrushes hands down. Look no further!! Ever since my family has started using Sonicare our family dentist has been raving about our teeth and gums. They are healthier and feel cleaner!!</li>
            <li> Philips Sonicare HX6013 ProResults Brush Head Standard, 3-Pack is once again a good buy although too expensive. Tried knockoff product and ended up with loose bristles in the mouth.</li>
            <li> I love using the Sonicare, and the brushes are just fine, but why do replacement heads cost $6 each? The pro series heads are just a plastic mold with a brush on the end, not like the e-series which has magnets on each head replacement.</li>
            <li> Amazon was best price and free shipping when I got them. Sam&#x27;s Club did not even stock these (Dec 2007). I love the Sonicare Flexcare these go with. Be careful to order brush that fits your unit. The brushes are good for six months..3 months is just the recommended change date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips Sonicare ProResults HX6013 Brush Head Standard 3pk go with 900 series sonicare flexcare toothbrush. Not good for Elite, or other ones.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are vastly superior to Sonicare&#x27;s Advance series:    I was amazed at how well the sculpted contoured bristles fit the curves of my gumline and teeth.  I felt as if the brush head was custom made for my mouth.  They also have a dark blue raised bristle tip at one end that gets right inside hard to reach areas.    Further, these are completely sealed units; so, they don&#x27;t trap liquid inside like the Advance and probably the Elite.  I don&#x27;t own an Elite, but it looks like it could also trap liquid and toothpaste.  I hated having to disassemble and clean out the Advance.    Finally, these brush heads only work with Sonicare&#x27;s FlexCare series --  which is an amazingly light and manueverable brush handle, but that&#x27;s another review!</li>
            <li> I was looking for this in all the Publix and supermarket near my house, I finally found it on Amazon and is perfect! just what i was needing. :)</li>
            <li> Our Sonicare shipped with one brush, and sat in the closet for the longest time.  Now that my 9yo has braces, I bought these to make sure he brushes well.  He&#x27;s excited to brush his teeth, and I&#x27;m happy with the results on my own teeth.  Don&#x27;t brush back and forth like your old brush, let the machine do the work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size is fine for his mouth.  I don&#x27;t regret skipping the compact size.  These are smaller than most traditional toothbrush heads.  I don&#x27;t know if there are any true benefits to getting a whitening version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not giving these 5 stars because there are a couple things I&#x27;d like improved:  After a couple months&#x27; use, my brush is losing a couple bristles.  Apparently, I brush more vigorously than my wife and son.  Also:  the colored bands on the bottom need to be different colors.  The blueish green band and the greenish blue band have cause some confusion.</li>
            <li> What can you say about a toothbrush?  Only that these replacement brush heads cost about ten times what they should cost.  Philips is evidently taking its cue from the inkjet printer manufacturers -- lowball the main product, then charge all outdoors for the replacement parts.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare ProResults is the best electric  toothbrush ever made and the toothbrush heads which are very expensive, are very reasonable on Amazon&#x27;s subscription plan.  They come exactly on time and it makes my life a little easier not having to think about it.</li>
            <li> Convenient little devils; take them off the Philips Sonicare brush and they become perfect travel size brushes, and the color-coded rings are helpful for sharing the vibrating part. Heh. Star off for waste packaging - they come in a box, nestled in a giant plastic clamshell, with plastic covers over the bristles, and a single-serving bag for the rings. Could do all that with a simple paper box, I think.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s for flexcare tooth brush only. And it&#x27;s small, light, a very nice gadget. But just a little bit expensive.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare replacement brushes work just as well as the orignal units and the Sonicare is the best electric tooth brush that we have ever had.  The only nit is the the rubber moisture seal ring between the brush base and the removeable brush has no recess to seat it.  If the brush loosens the least little bit, the seal ring flops around. Again a minor nit. Bottom line is that I will buy this replacebrush and unit again.</li>
            <li> I like these they are not quite as large as the old toothbrush heads for my former sonicare toothbrush..</li>
            <li> Although still too expensive, this is one of the more competitive sources (price) for these replacement heads. This is my third lot from this source, They work well.</li>
            <li> I have been using Philips Sonicare tooth brushes for years.  It takes a long time for the power portion of the tooth brush to actually stop working.  Usually the brush heads become more difficult to find and that is the reason that I upgrade.  The ProResults model does a very good job, is light weight and the charger requires very little counter space (slightly larger than the size of the tooth brush).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After purchasing replacement brush heads from local stores and then from ebay, I decided to check pricing from Amazon.  That was two orders ago and I just placed another one.  Amazon pricing is better than I have found elsewhere and delivery is quick.</li>
            <li> I owned a Sonicare long ago, one of the big old plain looking ones. I stopped using it for a while because the cost of head replacement was just too great for my budget. I recently purchased one of the newer models and I enjoy it much more now that I have braces and it cleans my teeth up nicely. I do, however, have one gripe about Sonicare&#x27;s toothbrush line. They don&#x27;t offer firmer bristle brushes. If I replaced the brushes as much as I \\&quot;should\\&quot; according to how they feel and the wear marks, I would probably change them once a month.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say about these brush heads other than they are genuine Phillips parts and they are priced really good and ship very quick. The quality is what I&#x27;ve come to expect from the Phillips Sonicare product line. They are durable and they clean your teeth way better than brushing manually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking at these heads, then you more than likely already own the Sonicare system and already know how amazing the system is. If you don&#x27;t own a Sonicare system, look into it.  I was skeptical at first because of price, but I can honestly say after using it for about a year, it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare electric tooth brushes are pretty good and do make a difference for me.  It&#x27;s not a good thing when you are on a first name basis with everyone in your dentist&#x27;s office.  But, I think Philips has too many different models and I think they replacement heads are way too expensive.  It also bugs me that there is no way to replace batteries.  I&#x27;m going to look around for an alternative.</li>
            <li> Within 2 weeks the bristles were all bent over and looked like I&#x27;ve been using it for months or like a pet chewed on it (and I do not brush my teeth hard).  Perhaps this product is not the original because the brush head that came with the actual brush lasted longer and did not have broken and bent bristles.</li>
            <li> The brush-heads have taken a steep decline in longevity.  I used to change my heads every 3-4 months, now with the newest set I went from \\&quot;blue to clear\\&quot; (all the way down) in less than 1 MONTH!!  They cannot be made from the same materials as before.  I am very UNhappy and I am actively seeking a better solution.</li>
            <li> I should have been suspicious when a toothbrush head purportedly manufactured in the United States was shipped from China. Problems:&lt;br /&gt;1. The toothbrush head did not fit properly onto my Sonicare toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;2. I&#x27;m getting gunk/buildup in the bottom of the head that I&#x27;ve never gotten with a prior Sonicare head.&lt;br /&gt;3. The ring at the base won&#x27;t stay on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this toothbrush head and I&#x27;ve stopped using mine.</li>
            <li> Works like expected.  It is easy to clip on to the sonicare brush.  A little difficult to pull the head off though.</li>
            <li> I have a healthy white sonicare, I want to know if these will fit my brush? anyone help please, I am confused</li>
            <li> Hi! I ordered the toothbrush heads almost 1 month ago. I still have not received the package. Can you please contact me?</li>
            <li> I bought the three pack. This is the first part of a subscription.  The first 2 worked well. However, the third one just keeps on flying off. Seems like the mechanism in the brush is damaged.   Now I&#x27;m stuck without any brushes since my next subscription installment is not due until Jan</li>
            <li> When my Elite died after 6 years, I replaced it with a Flexcare because the smaller, lighter size and dual voltage made it great for traveling overseas.  I left on my trip mid September, 2010 with a new Flexcare. As of Jan 31, 2011, I have had to use 3 Flexcare heads, brushing twice a day and changing heads only when the indicator showed that I needed to. This is in contrast to the Elite heads which lasted me at least 4 to 6 months, even tho my tooth brushing regimen did not change.</li>
            <li> Actually, these are very good.  I have the phillip sonicare and these brushes match to that handle.  They last a long time and seem to do the job very well.</li>
            <li> Your teeth feel like you&#x27;ve been to the dentist for a cleaning every time you brush.  Compact and easy to use.  Wish they had a separate storage stand one could buy for additional brush heads since my entire family uses this brush (total of 4.)</li>
            <li> I enjoy that i don&#x27;t have to worry about making sure i have replacement brush head. It is so convenient and i recommend to subscribe to the automated delivery service.</li>
            <li> Great product and great price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All genuine too</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare products for about 10 years now, and really like them.  The new brush was purchased a couple of years ago and replacing brush heads every 3-4 months really helps on the visits to the dentist office.</li>
            <li> Not a whole lot to say here, they replacement heads, originals, they work, I love the tooth brush.  Nothing left to say.</li>
            <li> We have used these  toothbrushes very successfully for years because we thought all these kind of toothbrushes work the same. But, we were  wrong. We started using Sonicare 2 years ago and can&#x27;t imagine using anything else, even when we travel. Our kids use the Sonicare, now also since it is quite affordable, and just use them. Great price and product so it scores again with us and with another product priced significantly lower than anywhere else. I prefer the compact heads over the regular ones and you can&#x27;t beat this price. Not much to say about the heads without mentioning that the Sonicare very easy on your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> These are the larger brush heads for the Sonicare Series. They work great and provide the best brush I&#x27;ve ever had, especially as compared to a manual brush. The three pack will last me roughly 6 months. They contain a wear mark that will disappear when the are ready to be changed. It&#x27;s a little more expensive than a manual brush but well worth the difference in price. I like these heads better than the smaller heads. They cover my teeth much better and feel more like a regular sized toothbrush in my mouth. Don&#x27;t skimp and buy the generic version! There is a difference! I recommend these and they work great!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what we needed</li>
            <li> I ORDERED THESE SONICARE BRUSH HEADS FOR MY HUSBAND FOR CHRISTMAS.  DELIVERY WAS VERY PROMPT AND THIS IS EXACTLY THE SAME PRODUCT SOLD FOR A MUCH HIGHER PRICE ELSEWHERE.  WHEN I NEED BRUSH HEADS I WILL DEFINITELY ORDER THESE, AGAIN!</li>
            <li> Great value for the price</li>
            <li> I gave a review but reviewed wrong product a few minutes ago. I found these replacement heads to work very well. I waited longer than I should have and after installed and found teeth cleaning was better and faster. I will change next time when the white shows up on end of brush.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome toothbrush that came highly recommended by my dentist. Great price and fast delivery. This is the best toothbrush I have ever used. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> product was as described and for a great price. all seem to be original products.. will use this shop again</li>
            <li> Be careful not to brush too hard - the gums will start receding. I made this mistake. For this reason I decided to use regular brush once a day. Immediately got plague. So use Sonicare gently, exactly how they describe.    Arthur,  [...]</li>
            <li> These brush heads are specified for my new Sonicare Flexcare RS980 Toothbrush but also work on some other models.  This whole combination is a fantastic product for oral hygiene care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While extra 3-pack standard and compact heads were purchased when buying the Flexcare RS980 Toothbrush, I prefer the standard head. If the standard head (like a regular toothbrush) fits a normal sized, adult mouth, it seems that you&#x27;re gaining about twice the amount of cleaning action over say a 2 minute period as compared to using a compact brush head that is about half the size. Otherwise, if preferring a compact head and having a normal sized, adult mouth, you may want to compensate for less brushing action by increasing brushing time.</li>
            <li> When Sam&#x27;s club quit carrying the refills for my Sonicare brush heads ,I was pleasantly surprised to find them on Amazon.com. The price is so much lower than the $40 per pack I paid recently at a drug store.  Thank you, again, Amazon!</li>
            <li> I purchased these toothbrush heads for my Healthy White Sonicare toothbrush.  They look exactly like the previous toothbrush heads I have used, but they do not fit all the way on the brush.  It is very weird.  We tried all three and none would fit.  I called Philips and they agreed to send replacements but really didn&#x27;t give me an explanation of why the product was defective.  My model is #HX6710 and they claimed the ProResults Standard would fit my brush.  I&#x27;m hesistant to buy any more brush heads from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love electric toothbrush, and Phillips has the best so far.  These brush last about 6 months, so it&#x27;s good to have an auto refill.  What I don&#x27;t like about this product is the price... highway robbery if you ask me.  The whole system is about couple hundred bucks, but the heads is nearly 30 buck?</li>
            <li> I really like these toothbrush heads.  They are very comfortable and get into all the right places.  At first, mine didn&#x27;t last so long, but I realized I was probably pressing too hard. My next replacement lasted a few months.  I think they suggest replacing every three months.  I don&#x27;t think the dark blue strip is a good indicator of when to change.  You know you need to change it when it gets all twisted.  My husband and I both didn&#x27;t believe the claim that this system would actually whiten your teeth, but we have noticed good results. I&#x27;m getting excellent check-ups from my dentist.  I will continue to buy these very same replacements.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare toothbrushes for two years now and I have to say that the standard brush head is the best. The compact one is simply too small to brush with and as a result, takes longer to brush. Furthermore, when you are massaging your gums with the sonicare brush, the compact one just doesn&#x27;t work that well. I have only bought a compact 3-pack once and I will never go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the quality of the brush-head, it is superb. However, I dropped a star because it simply does not last 3 months. It lasts closer to 1.5 months for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had three or four Sonicares back to the really old fat ones that had a huge replacement head on them, then the series that had a slightly smaller head, and now the newest that uses these heads.  These are so much easier to clean and are cheaper.  Taking the heads off to clean the older ones was the main drawback and these are easier to clean and don&#x27;t get messy to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the increased portability.  I have never taken my Sonicare when traveling, but I do notice the difference in cleaning with a regular brush if I&#x27;m gone for two or three weeks.  With the new model, I may take it next time.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended the Philips Sonicare to us so we tried it. Not only do we love it, but we&#x27;re getting better checkups too! And with Amazon, we&#x27;re sent a new supply of brushes every three months without having to reorder.</li>
            <li> For thirty years I have used Sonicare toothbrushes.  I have used used my current&lt;br /&gt;brush (my most recent Sonicare brush) for at least&lt;br /&gt;8 years and it still performs as if brand new.  The two minute timed brushing session  (brush automatically stops after 2 minutes) keeps my&lt;br /&gt;teeth and gums in excellent condition. I am 82 years old and my dentist consistently praises&lt;br /&gt;me on my excellent teeth. This particular order&lt;br /&gt;was for two replacement brush heads only, which I&lt;br /&gt;order about once a year, and I brush my teeth twice daily and still have my natural permanent&lt;br /&gt;teeth, except for one implant about 25 years ago&lt;br /&gt;due to a broken molar.  My dentist recommended&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare when I asked which electric toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;I should consider.  Sonicare is the only one he&lt;br /&gt;mentioned, and am I glad!</li>
            <li> Phillips Sonicare HX6013 ProResults Brush Head Standard, 3-Pack, is a great product.  The replacement heads are quite pricey.  However, you don&#x27;t need to replace them every 3 months.  You can probably replace them every 6 months to get your money&#x27;s worth.  The brushes really do the job.</li>
            <li> I have no problem keeping my teeth clean now. This brush does a great job in keeping my teeth whiter.   Thanks Sonicare.</li>
            <li> ...at a fair price.    I&#x27;ve been using a Sonicare for several years now. I&#x27;m happy, but I&#x27;m afraid that my dentist is depressed, since a quick cleaning and checkup are all he gets to do to me.    I like the idea of being able to have these when I need them, so I signed up for the automatic delivery every three months. That saves time, money, and the hassle of having to find a local store that sells these brush heads.</li>
            <li> I bought these brush heads for a Sonicare FlexCare toothbrush.  The FlexCare toothbrush is very slender and compact compared to the older Sonicare toothbrushes.  These brush heads seem pretty comfortable to use and they seem to hold up about as well as the heavier Sonicare brush heads.  They seem to do a good job of cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li> The service is fast - I love being able to have it on auto order every three months!  Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> Simply replacement heads for specific Sonicare toothbrush handles (FlexCare &amp; ProResults), which I believe are the best electric toothbrush systems.  They appear to be identical in size and shape to replacement heads I have purchased before, but the dark blue \\&quot;reminder\\&quot; bristles that were on earlier heads are now nearly indistinguishable to the pale green bristles on the rest of the head on this brush (you can tell from the photos on this product page), and they do not resemble the product literature included with the Philips toothbrush.  They also appear to be softer than previous head replacements.  Someone had suggested they were \\&quot;knockoffs;\\&quot; I&#x27;ve used them about a month now and they seem to be as durable as the old Sonicare heads - the reminder bristles change at about a month of use, in spite of being very pale to start with.  They work great and I recommend them to Sonicare users.</li>
            <li> Great product!! I would recommend this product for anyone looking for a great tooth brush. This was a great price as well.</li>
            <li> Saved 25% purchasing it here instead of a Target store.  Saved 50% here instead of the Sonicare website.  I love saving money.</li>
            <li> Package came on time (quickly), product was exactly as described.  Just easier/cheaper than getting it from costco or other outlet centers.</li>
            <li> These brushes work perfectly.  They are really expensive though. But what isn&#x27;t crazy expensive nowadays. I love my sonic care system. I use it in tandem with my water pic, traditional brush, and floss. My teeth are healthy. It&#x27;s a good feeling.</li>
            <li> Another review on something that gets an A for doing the job that it was created to do. Amazon always has great prices and I needed replacements heads so here we are. They worked fine. The bristles were not too painful or soft. They stay on my toothbrush without any problems.</li>
            <li> I purchase the compact-size heads for myself as I have a smaller mouth and teeth, but my boyfriend has a big mouth and big teeth so these are great.  We can&#x27;t say enough good things about how awesome these or the toothbrush itself are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With every new set, you get more colored bands to denote whose is whose.</li>
            <li> Overpriced, overpriced, overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the retail store private labelled alternatives we tried were worse - wore out in two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe the technology is correct, but appears that manufacture has a lock on the market.  Will have to wait until the patent expires.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush out there.</li>
            <li> good quality brush head. My boyfriend use Philips sonicare for several months, he said it is very excellent on his tooth and also this brush head is fit on the philips sonicare.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon, I can get these heads just a little bit cheaper than at Walmart or Target. I use them with my Sonicare Flexcare. You will be surprised how much of a difference a new brush head makes. You think that your head isn&#x27;t worn down until you feel how much more powerful the toothbrush is with a fresh head.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the price and fast delivery for the brush heads for my sonic electric toothbrush.  I bought the 3 pack for a great price.</li>
            <li> Brush heads for my Philips Sonicare RS980. I wish it was a bit cheaper then its original price. Because the tooth brush itself is expensive.</li>
            <li> Bought these as replacements for my new Sonicare toothbrush. These are a little spendy for what they are, but I can&#x27;t live without my Sonicare so it works out.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to accompany my new Sonicare, unfortunately I had some issues with the delivery of the toothbrush but it was not a seller issue. To the product, these brush heads are much more hygienic than the precious brush head design. This version does not develop mold inside the casing. With this design being slightly more compact than the previous version as well and I feel it fits much better in the mouth. The increased length on the neck of the brush head allows for easier access to the molar region of your mouth allowing you to get at those hard to reach places.   Another amazing thing about these brush heads is I am amazed at how clean the bristles get the surface of the tooth without being rough on the gum line. Overall, I am very pleased with the shipment and inspite of the other issues with the order, I still was able to use this after an awesome in-store purchase for the same model Sonicare toothbrush I was going to get on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I had already purchased my first ever electric toothbrush.  It is the Philips Sonic Flex care with sanitizer.  I bought the extra brushes ahead due to the excellent price.  They are great.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.  Only one complaint - I don&#x27;t think the indicator is accurate on when to change the brush head...seems to run out much sooner than the 3 months.</li>
            <li> Got them a few weeks ago, using one of them right now and it works, just like the old one.  Orders arrived promptly and in good condition. Will order them again.</li>
            <li> I guess I must say that this is what it is...a tooth brush head. It is a great tooth brush and my wife loves to use it but in the end it is a tooth brush head...</li>
            <li> GREAT THIS IS FOR MY GRAND SON FOR CHRISTMAS  THIS IS HIGH QUALITY AND ALSO FAST SHIPPING HE WILL  LOVE IT</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare ProResults Brush Heads are amazing.  They make my teeth feel VERY clean.  I bought them on Amazon for such a great price with free shipping.  I saved at least $10.00 buying them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Keeps my teeth nice and clean</li>
            <li> The genuine HX6013 Philips Proresults Brush Heads are a good choice.  The only issue I have is that the blue strip fades in a few weeks instead of 3 months.  So it not a good indication of when the brush needs to be replaced.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean I am so pleased! No more gross feeling on my teeth and  I have used this brush with whitening paste and now they feel fabulous. The replacement heads are a little pricey but they are definitely are an investment because I am proud to smile my nice new smile! :)</li>
            <li> Great product and so much cheaper than the market or Costco!  Service was fantastic and I would recommend these brush heads and sonicare to everyone</li>
            <li> Brush heads for the Sonic toothbrush refills.  Great product and easy to find in Amazon.  Great price for the brush heads</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush, and it means that I need to use the replacement all the time. It is great to have a replacement, also was great to receive it within 3 days.</li>
            <li> Previously, I had the small head brushes, but these are much better for me. I love them! The sonicare rules!!</li>
            <li> I was happy to find these replacement heads for my Sonicare for such a reasonable price.  A great plus was that I received them extremely fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will order them again.</li>
            <li> Purchased a 3-pack of Philips Sonicare ProResults toothbrush heads from this seller.  Item arrived in original package as specified in sellers ad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned Sonicare toothbrushes for years. They keep my teeth so clean. And Philips backs up their products.  I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> This replacement brush worked perfectly in my sonic toothbrush unit.  Note that standard sized brush is $5.00 cheaper than mini-sized brush using the same attachment base.</li>
            <li> Another Happy Customer from Amazon. The product is top quality. I received quick service and it was priced right. Thank you Amazon for another Happy Customer. 5 Star Quality Service.</li>
            <li> The Price is Excellent. What it does lack is instructions for removing the old brush.  I&#x27;ve found on the Internet how to remove the Top from the Main Body of the Toothbrush but getting the old brush off the \\&quot;gearings\\&quot; is another story.  It&#x27;s made out of plastic so naturally one is reluctant to \\&quot;force the issue\\&quot;. Finally though I broke the friggin thing trying to get the old brush off. Resolution! Great :-(</li>
            <li> These are flimsy brushes that wore out in a week.  The &amp;#34;indicator&amp;#34; band does not appear to function, as it stays blue despite massive wear.  These brushes fall off the handle very easily.  I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the Philips Sonicare system even though I feel it is a bit extreme on pricing.  The brush costs a lot on its own with its charging base (about $70 list); and even more if you get the UV sanitizer (I paid over $100 for the brush, replacement heads, base and sanitizer).  And replacement heads cost about $10 per head retail).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I have to tell you that it is a system that I wouldn&#x27;t do without now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those (like my wife) who tried it and stopped because they didn&#x27;t like the feeling of the vibrating head (it is pretty strange at first), I say keep with it.  In my wife&#x27;s case I lost the battle, but my kids love the system now and, like me, they couldn&#x27;t do without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note about cost: using Amazon is a great way to save money.  I went on Philips and found a coupon (they&#x27;re offered periodically) and then applying that to the savings Amazon gives you.  And when it comes to the replacement heads, (which they recommend changing every three months or so) put them on a Subscribe &amp; Save schedule, and you&#x27;ll save even more.  You can not only save up to 15 percent on the S &amp; S, but you can also request a more liberal replacement subscription schedule if you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s most important, you&#x27;ll get a GREAT cleaning every time.  The system really works--I love my Philips Sonicare, and I couldn&#x27;t imagine NOT using it now.</li>
            <li> This rechargeable toothbrush is one of the best that I have ever used. I love that it can be put into the dishwasher to be washed as needed. It has made my teeth SO much cleaner (no plaque), my gums are in much better shape and my teeth are whiter. It has a UV sanitizer that also comes with it!</li>
            <li> Able to have this auto shipped at a regular interval at least $10 cheaper than I can buy this 3 pack anywhere locally and I don&#x27;t even have to remember to re-order.  Very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product, hassle free ordering. The exact product I was looking for at a great price. Would definitely order from here again.</li>
            <li> They look like the right brush heads but they do not fit exactly.  Maybe that is why they are discounted.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what happened because the package was still sealed on both ends, but there were only 2 brush heads inside. I made sure I wasn&#x27;t sent the wrong item; the box does in fact say 3 brush heads. Really needed new ones otherwise I would have sent it back. Other than that, the quality is fine.</li>
            <li> These are replacement brush heads for out Philips Sonicare ProResults Electric Toothbrush. Like all other toothbrushes, these wear out and need replacing. These fit our unit and work just like the original ones.  Wish they had some good generic ones, but by others reviews, that is not the case.</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare Bush Heads that I purchased through Amazon were received well before I expected to receive the shipment.  Product was as described and I will purchase that same product again through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Received in a short time, great price, appreciated the product availability which made replacing our product easy and quick.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! If I was stranded on a desert island I&#x27;d need a power source and my sonicare! :)</li>
            <li> I have been using the Philips Sonicare brushes for about ten years. The brushes had worn out too quickly. This new brush is great. The bristles last approximately forty percent longer.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes.. Really clean your whole mouth well.</li>
            <li> Not a name brand refill.</li>
            <li> the real thing, yes it costs more. but the right replacement parts are essential rather than cheap knock offs!</li>
            <li> I bought these refills for my Philips Sonicare HX6731/02 Healthywhite Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush.  It seems that Philips is phasing these out now (June 2015) in favor of their newer (and more expensive) toothbrush head.  These brush heads work very well.  They have an indicator stripe to tell you when it is time to change your brush.  This is great for the lazy among us, because who remembers when you last changed it, and how long it has been.  These brush heads do a great job cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> These work great, just like what came with my toothbrush originally.  I just wish the price was more in line with the cost of producing these.  They don&#x27;t seem any more &#x27;complex&#x27; than a standard toothbrush which costs an order of magnitude less.</li>
            <li> These are not legit. They don&#x27;t stay on the Sonicare handle and the blue bristles never fade. Look for the real Philips brand brush heads.</li>
            <li> Of the 3 brush heads, only one seemed to stay on once the toothbrush was turned on. Will be returning this product. Amazon has been good about paying for the return shipping.</li>
            <li> Very quick service and they fit my toothbrush exactly.</li>
            <li> I tried to save money with a generic brand and couldn&#x27;t finagle a way to keep the darned things on the handle!</li>
            <li> We have been using these brush heads for a few years and buying them through Amazon. There has never been a problem until our last order, very obvious corners have been cut in quality. Upon removing them from the package the bristles looked noticably finer and softer than they used to be. After about one week the bristles are flayed out and look like they need to be replaced. There is no way these things will last three months, I&#x27;ll be surprised to get another week out of them. We bought two 3-packs and are returning the second unopened one. We won&#x27;t be ordering these again. I hope we can find a source for decent ones, otherwise it will be back to a regular tooth brush.</li>
            <li> After a week of use, the first head came apart, so I pushed it back together and use it very carefully.</li>
            <li> Since starting to use this particular &#x27;standard size&#x27; brush head I believe my teeth are being cleaned better than ever before. In addition to the Sonicare motion, the cut and angle of the bristles are probably the difference makers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is that I cannot get 3 months use out of a brush head.  I probably get only 2 months use at best before the &#x27;reminder bristles&#x27; fade to the point where Sonicare recommends replacement. That&#x27;s why I gave this product four stars rather than five. The price here at Amazon is much better than what I&#x27;ve been able to find in stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend the compact version of this brush as it does not have the same bristle configuration and lasts even less time than the standard size brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist told me that generally speaking, he sees a 30% improvement in gum health for people who purchase this product. My experience backs this up.</li>
            <li> I love my Philips toothbrush. However, the brush heads need to be replaced in less than 3 months contrary to what they claim. The service of the merchant though was very good, always on time.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent. My teeth feel very clean. Similar to getting a cleaning at the dentist office. The only con, is having to replace the brush every 8 weeks.</li>
            <li> I am a total convert to the Sonicare toothbrush. My teeth have never been, or felt cleaner except right after a professional cleaning. These brush heads last longer than regular brushes but the price Philips puts on them is way out of bounds. However, you&#x27;ve taken the plunge, so you may as well buy them as cheaply as possible, right here at the digital general store.</li>
            <li> Great product. Fits my sonicare perfectly and the brush is nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Great for braces, these LARGER Sonicare brushes are a lot better for braces than the smaller ones. My ortho and I noticed a difference:)</li>
            <li> Product is very good, I was for a friend, a friend like after use, next time will be in to buy, thanks</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for and needed!  This is a quality product and perfect replacement part for my toothbrush!!</li>
            <li> I got these to replace the head on my \\&quot;Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush\\&quot;.  They fit perfectly.  The bristles seem like they might be a little different shape than the original brush, but it works just fine.</li>
            <li> Sonicare heads for the sonicare vibrating handle.  If you own the brush these are the larger head vs. the smaller head.  The color on the bristles lasts as long as the original that came with the toothbrush.  They fit inside the UV light holster.  As with anything that is a MUST or a NEED to make it work they charge you an arm and a leg for the brushes.  It is something that is known going into buying the Sonicare package but pretty depressing when you spend over 100 for the original package.  Will buy them though until the vibrating handle dies.  Hopefully years down the road.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in only two days in perfect condition. I will use this site again to purchase this product in the future.</li>
            <li> But, they all are. No matter where you buy them. Sometimes seems to last longer than others. Still love my Sonicare</li>
            <li> bought these replacement brush heads for my sonic toothbrush, they are what they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they fit and work fine on my brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles turned to a grayish color right away.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, these brushes look and work well and came well packaged.  However, the pricing of these which are just basically plastic is really kinda crazy.  I love my Phillips sonicare toothbrush, but it&#x27;s really a luxury at these prices.  I therefore use them a little longer than recommended though and make myself feel better about the price. Toothbrush is amazing I have to say.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush now for about 2 years. The more I use it the more I like it. It&#x27;s easy to clean. My wife and I both share it. We have bought the extra replacement brushes with no problem finding. It has enough speeds to find one you feel comfortable with. I think you get a great gum massage with an electric like this and hopefully that eliminates the need for gum surgery down the road. It holds a good charge and the fact that you cradle it each time, it&#x27;s always ready.</li>
            <li> The Brush Head pack that was sent to me does not fit on my Philips Sonicare ProResults.  I have tried to return the item to Amazon but it does not allow me to click the appropriate button.</li>
            <li> brush heads didn&#x27;t last a week of use, started laying flat and became useless, a big disappointment!  Was asked to change my review of product and get a refund if I mentioned I returned the unused brush heads for testing and never did. I would not buy these again!</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product from this shipper before, simply because I cannot find them ANYWHERE!  They are, as the name implies.........Sonicare...........the best in the business.  They say change every 3 months, but, I think that is a bit much, 6 months is fine, but, if you see your  brushes flatten out, or appear spindly, then, of course change them.  Thank you for providing this important product.........KUDOS!</li>
            <li> The heads fit the [[ASIN:B000UK2W4C Philips Sonicare HX6932/10 FlexCare RS930 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]], and are very simple to replace. Simply pull off your used brush and pop a new one in its place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare recommends that you switch out your brush head every 3 months, but this depends on how vigorously you brush. You&#x27;ll want to replace the head once the bristles start spreading out. This might take 2 months or 6.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare products are great. You&#x27;ll really notice how much cleaner your teeth feel and whiter they look if you&#x27;re coming from a traditional tooth brush.</li>
            <li> LEGIT TOOTHBRUSH HEADS; SONICARE THE REAL THING BUT SUCH A GREAT PRICE.  I WOULD DEFINTELY BUY AGAIN BECAUSE ALL WENT WELL WITH THE BUYING AND SHIPPING ALSO.</li>
            <li> While I like my Sonicare toothbrush, I don&#x27;t like having to pay the price they charge for replacement heads. So, I tried some of the low cost generics (this one: [[ASIN:B007MCT5SC Philips Sonicare ProResults Compatible GENERIC (Standard) Brush Head - 2 Pack]]). It really made me appreciate the performance of the real thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still wish these were cheaper, but the originals work well, and allow the Sonicare to perform as it was intended to perform. The generics didn&#x27;t come close in terms of performance. I gave the generics only one star (and they deserved none); I consider these to be 5-star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also tried the new Sonicare \\&quot;diamond\\&quot; brushes, and find I prefer these (the Proresults). I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in brush performance, plus these last longer and cost less versus the diamond version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend if you want to get the most out of your Sonicare.</li>
            <li> These are good brush heads I go through them in about 3 months so this 3 pack does the job.  Whenever you go with an Electric toothbrush they are always expensive but ordering them online always comes out a little cheaper especially through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I carefully matched this with my toothbrush and it&#x27;s supposed to be the right pone but seems small. It works, so it&#x27;s fine but just not exactly the one I was hoping for</li>
            <li> Purchased these replacement heads and 1) they do not fit like they should when you pop them on 2) they have an identifier on the handle I have never seen before on heads, and 3) THEY LAST MAYBE 3 WEEKS!!!!!  What a rip off. I would like my money back. These are not quality replacement heads and I have purchased many before. Either they got them cheap from Phillips because they were a crap batch or they are a total fraud.</li>
            <li> I had been putting off replacing my toothbrush head and knew I needed to buy one soon. I have gone to several different stores and could not belive the prices! The last store I went to wanted $44 for a pack of three. After logging onto Amazon and seeing some complaints about sellers selling fake sonicare toothbrush heads, I was leery of purchasing anything online. I took a chance with these and am pleased! These are legit, and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY -- these appear to be fake.  Only lasted a few days before completely dead.  These are NOT authentic.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised, works well with my sonicare without issue. Read carefully and make sure this is the right replacement head for your sonicare</li>
            <li> I have used this tooth brush and heads for a number of years and don&#x27;t plan on changing. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Worked with my current sonicare and I would recommend to anyone looking for a great deal for replacement brush heads</li>
            <li> I was unable to find these replacement brushes anywhere.  So glad to have found them on this site.  I love this toothbrush system.</li>
            <li> Love it! I hope to get this in the future!  It is cheaper online in then in the stores like Target.</li>
            <li> A very reasonable price for this item! It fits the Healthy white model that I use, Can not go wrong.</li>
            <li> Works with my toothbrush</li>
            <li> well designed heads. well packaged. packaging should maybe be a little easier to open. heads wear well and do last the three month reccomendation</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a year now and haven&#x27;t had any cavities. My teeth feel so much cleaner than when I was using just a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> They work well, and hold up decently.  I couldn&#x27;t rate a 5-star because of cost (I&#x27;m just think they&#x27;re over priced for what they are).</li>
            <li> I really like these tooth brush heads. I have sensitive gums and these are great. They do not make my gums hurt at all.</li>
            <li> Brushes fit base very snugly and offer a crisp brush of the teeth.  Couldn&#x27;t find them at our local stores...will order online from now on.  Very convenient.</li>
            <li> I love our Sonicare toothbrush and these heads fit it.  However, I found these for cheaper (per brush head) at Costco.  I believe it was about 2 dollars cheaper per brush head.</li>
            <li> There is not much to say other than if you buy a Brush,Always by the name brand.They fit better,feel better and last longer.This is my second time buying Philips Sonicare ProResults Brush Head after buying a generic brand.I will never again buy a generic replacement after buying ProResults.You pay more but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> My brush heads easily fell off while brushing. I tested all three that came in the package. If you hold the brush on with a finger it works, but it&#x27;s very annoying.</li>
            <li> Got my son these extra heads to go with his toothbrush  It was a good deal and easier than going out looking for the right one.&lt;br /&gt;Convenience and a good product</li>
            <li> These are very good brush heads but they don&#x27;t last as long as they should. If they did I&#x27;d say they were well worth it.</li>
            <li> I really like the Sonicare BUT it does not work any longer so I gave the brush heads to my son.  He also has one and his still works!</li>
            <li> i have owned every brand electronic toothbrush made. the Sonicare ProResults is by far the best. noisy .. yes. but that&#x27;s what makes it work so well. you can&#x27;t have vibrations without noise. when you push too hard the noise gets louder .. good feedback for the correct brushing pressure. the brushes go one easy and are simple and stay nice and clean. being more minimalistic than previous styles they are less expensive and i think i feel less guilt throwing away (others have lots of plastic and metal and magnets). nice price, 2 day Amazon prime delivery ... Amazon prime ROCKS!</li>
            <li> This rechargeable toothbrush is one of the best that I have ever used.  I love that it can be put into the dishwasher to be washed as needed.  It has made my teeth SO much cleaner (no plaque), my gums are in much better shape and my teeth are whiter.  It has a UV sanitizer that also comes with it!</li>
            <li> On recommendation from my dentist I purchased the Sonicare and I really like it. My teeth feel like I just had a professional teeth cleaning &amp; it seems to be helping tighten the gaps along my gumline. It holds a charge for longer than a week!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had very sensitive teeth and gums my whole life. These took some getting used to. Now my teeth and gums are no longer sensitive. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because these are so powerful (used with the Sonicare system), thereby desensitizing me or some other reason. I do know that this powerful system with these brush heads really do the trick for me. I now don&#x27;t fear that morning ah-ha! when I first start brushing my teeth. Awesome product.</li>
            <li> I bought these thinking they were the &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; tooth brush heads but these particular ones and cheap. I literally could only get two uses out of each head before they starting falling apart. It&#x27;s worth spending the extra money and buying the quality ones in store.</li>
            <li> They work and that&#x27;s what this is all about.  So many toothbrushes now on the market so if you have an older one, Amazon is the place to get replacements.</li>
            <li> What can I say? It&#x27;s a tooth brush. It brushes fine. How could this be any bad? If you need it, get it.</li>
            <li> It was like buying them from a store. they arrived in excellent condition and work great with my flexcare brush!</li>
            <li> Picked this up on the recommendation of a good friend.  My whole family after using this for a few weeks, the whole family likes the way the brush cleans.  Personally, my gums feel better after using this for this short time.      The different modes were a bit tricky to get everyone to understand, but we now all have our favorites.    Recommended buy for anyone who would like to step into using a sonic toothbrush and prefers a well made product.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Sonicare electric toothbrush for about three years. I am thrilled with it! It gets my teeth cleaner than I can clean them with a manual brush, and it is both very effective and easier on my gums. It is very easy to use. These replacement brushes securely and easily attach to the unit. They are not cheap when compared to some other brushes, but how much is it worth to you to easily keep your teeth clean? In that sense, these brushes are a bargain!</li>
            <li> I had purchased these through Amazon once in the past from this seller and was pleased, but the second time I did it was a completely different experience.  Two of the three brush heads in the package I received kept popping off the toothbrush - one never snapped on completely, and the other stayed on for only thirty seconds or so while brushing. I had to throw them both away.  The bristles of the third brush head wore out so quickly so that I had to throw that one away too after only about a month (and no, I didn&#x27;t brush my teeth four times a day).  They appeared to be exactly the same as the ones I had ordered before, but it was a extremely inferior product compared to the one I previously purchased.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Like other recent reviewers, I am very disappointed in these brush heads. Although they came in an authentic-looking package, I have to assume they&#x27;re knockoffs, because I&#x27;ve bought Sonicare replacement heads in the store before and they&#x27;ve lasted forever. After only one week of use, these were completely frayed and all the blue color was gone. Also, they have weird numbers on them that I&#x27;ve never seen on genuine Sonicare brush heads, and the letters look a bit blurry when viewed close-up. I will not be ordering from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.  They fit over my Sonicare tooth brush very easily.</li>
            <li> I put one of these on last week when I received them and it seems immediately the bristles are all worn and it already needs to be replaced.  Not sure if this is a knockoff of the real thing because the packaging looks exactly like the real ones so I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a knockoff. The last ones I purchased were through a different seller and they were perfect.  I will not buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> These things have a very loose fit. They don&#x27;t fit down snug over the little metal nub on my Sonicare so they slip off all the time while I&#x27;m brushing and fall on the floor and then they get hair on them and I have to wash them off and my mouth is still full of toothpaste--it&#x27;s a nightmare. It makes me wonder if these are knock-offs but they came in what looked like legit Panasonic packaging. They definitely don&#x27;t fit right though. And yes, they are the correct heads for my brush--or at least they&#x27;re supposed to be.</li>
            <li> How sad that these toothbrush heads need to cost so much money and last for only a short amount of time before they need to be replaced. Not Amazon&#x27;s fault but Sonicare should consider selling the replacement heads for less overhead and keep folks brushing their teeth with good quality brushes.</li>
            <li> I needed a replacement head for my toothbrush so I checked on Amazon. I love the package of three - now I don&#x27;t need to order again for a while.</li>
            <li> On time. Quality as expected.</li>
            <li> The product is good, although pricey.  The bristles could be a little softer on the brushes.  Six packs for a cheaper price would be nice.</li>
            <li> Great price after shopping online and at local retailers for a sonicare replacement head but it seems you get what you pay for. I matched the specs on the type &amp; model of the Sonicare I own but found within less than a week I was having to hold onto the toothbrush head to keep in intact while I brush. Oh joy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For you that may be concerned, I&#x27;m not even using pressure-I get that the brush and vibrations are supposed to do most of the work but it un-attaches before I&#x27;ve finished even a light brush cycle, which means that A) I have to hold onto the brush head to keep it intact with makes my finger numb B) Risk the brush head coming loose mid brush and spraying (gunk) all over my bathroom &amp; face and C) Makes me wonder why I bought a brush head totally malfunctions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not my favorite way to spend 1-2 minutes several times per day....</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t already have a sonicare, get one!&lt;br /&gt;The price on these replacement heads was great.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Very nice well-priced toothbrush heads.  But there is a diamond head now which is supposed to clean even better.  I&#x27;ll be looking for that.</li>
            <li> They fit my Sonicare perfectly. They also last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Maybe just a problem with the distributor, but this is not the standard Sonicare ProResults toothbrush refill.  Noticed that the brush did not snap on as tightly when I changed it out, and it fell off within 10 seconds of starting the brush cycle.  Spend the extra dollar, and buy elsewhere.</li>
            <li> excellent product, no plaque at my cleanings, my dentist is dumfounded how clean the toothbrush make my teeth so immaculate</li>
            <li> Would buy these heads again. This is a Good product. I would recommend this to any one looking to replace the one that came with the tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Works well and saved money buying these.</li>
            <li> As good as it is, well packed with protection. A great shopping experience if with more discount. No more words.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews here that said that they received a fake copy instead of the original product, and thought it wouldn&#x27;t happen to me. I thought, for sure Amazon would have fixed this by now. No luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even before I opened the package, I had a bad feeling. It arrived shoddily wrapped in a piece of plastic, taped by scotch-tape. The package itself looked fine, but when I opened it, it was immediately obvious it was a fake, a very poor copy. The bristles of the brush literally look like they were cut by hand, uneven, longer pieces sticking out here and there. The ProResults label also looks odd, crooked, some letters are in different size, done in what most resembles shimmer nail polish and already half-peeled off.</li>
            <li> I bought the set sold by jinlan inc and they are 100% fake. The brushes fizzled out right away, the plastic cap barely fits on to the head, and you can easily pull the neck off from the base when trying to remove the whole brush.</li>
            <li> The package arrived on time and didn&#x27;t have any problems.  I had ran out of Sonic Heads for my toothbrush and these were just perfect.</li>
            <li> The brushes we received seem like knockoffs.  Our 3 month old brushes that came with the unit are in better shape than these 1 week old replacements.  These immediately became frayed and soft after a few uses.  Next time I&#x27;ll buy them in the store.</li>
            <li> Love my Sonicare.  This is the best electric toothbrush we have ever used.  This was a great deal on replacement heads.</li>
            <li> The heads fall off while brushing, do not clasp the Philips Sonicare vibrating handle well. All 3 doing the same.  As well,  bristles look completely aged prematurely after just 1 1/2 months unlike the original brush heads which last about in excess of &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62; 3/4yr.</li>
            <li> Love Sonicare Electric Toothbrush for extra care for teeth.  I only wish the brush heads weren&#x27;t so expensive.  They are easy to install.</li>
            <li> The quality of the brush is good and lasts.  The price is good, I always get my replacements from amazon.  Fits our Sonicare perfect.</li>
            <li> Tried Oral-B and was happy with noted improvements until I gave the Sonicare a try...there&#x27;s no going back, now!  My teeth have never been cleaner on a daily basis.  And it is achieved so effortlessly.  Took a little getting used to, but the learning curve is minimal.  These brush heads are easy to pop on or off for sharing the handle with others.  You absolutely will not regret the money spent on this (any Sonicare) brush.</li>
            <li> Despite being described as Philips Sonicare brush heads, I do not believe that these are an official product.  After only one week of use, the bristles became frayed, spread out and useless. These are, quite frankly, terrible. They should last 2-3 months, based on past experience and as stated in the product description.  After receiving a refund by the seller (they did so quite promptly and without any hassle) I purchased Philips replacement heads where I used to get them, at a nearby big-box store and after several weeks of use, they still appear nearly new.  I originally wanted to purchase the brush heads from Amazon because the price at the big-box stores has increased significantly but it&#x27;s not worth saving money if the product is useless.</li>
            <li> While the price is about $2 less than walmart, the fit of these toothbrush heads is slightly off so you have take extra care to push it securely onto the base and then I really have trouble pulling it off. I have to wiggle and yank at it, and after brushing, it&#x27;s wet which makes it more difficult to get a grip on. I think the extra frustration may not be worth the savings.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads do not seem to be the same quality as the ones that I have been using.  These do not fit the power head as well, and almost seem like they might pop off during use.  However, they haven&#x27;t so far.  They also make about three times the noise of the old ones.  Finally, after one-month&#x27;s use, the bristles on the first brush head look like the old ones did after the recommended three month use-cycle.  (Bristle color gone and bristles bent back.)&lt;br /&gt;Do they work? Yeahhhh....but they sound like junk immediately, and look like junk after a month.  I suspect that the reviewer who thought these were &amp;#34;factory seconds&amp;#34; was probably right on the money.  I will definitely not buy these again at any price.</li>
            <li> I am returning my three pack because they are FAKES. I haven&#x27;t had to deal with this Chinese dupe crap for a long time, but it&#x27;s bound to happen eventually. DO NOT PURCHASE THESE FROM THIS SELLER. THEY WILL NOT FIT!</li>
            <li> These work great on my old sonicare body. They are cheaper than the heads in stores, but appear to be the same quality, so I am happy.</li>
            <li> We were sorely disappointed to find out that these brush heads are fake and a knock off. The packaging all makes it look like it&#x27;s coming from Philips but if you look closely their logos are blurry, the brush heads don&#x27;t fit, and they have to be replace every 2 weeks. Clearly not a quality item, don&#x27;t be fooled. Read the other 1 star reviews to see that these aren&#x27;t legitimate.</li>
            <li> Works as expected and lasts as expected.  You can get these anywhere, it is just easier here and usually a bit more cost effective.</li>
            <li> Love the sonicare brush.  Fits as promised and not a knock off. I would recommend for anyone with any history of cavities.  I feel clean all the time.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit our Healthy White toothbrush.  Have not had this problem with previous orders -- the brush heads don&#x27;t click on to the toothbrush as the fitting is too small.  Got a refund.  From now on will probably have to buy in a store?</li>
            <li> These brush heads are supposed to last three months.  They lasted about 3 days.  The bristles basically disintegrated.  I will purchase from a store from now on.</li>
            <li> Been using these brush heads for the past 4 years and every time I brush my teeth, It feels like if I got a cleaning done by a Dentist.</li>
            <li> These brush heads appear to be fake. The packing is quite convincing, but the brush heads are clearly a much lower quality than the ones I usually get. The bristles are very soft, and the heads do not snap onto the brush. In addition, the label on the heads look very rough. For reference, I ordered these from GOODTIMETOBY.</li>
            <li> I have been using Philips Sonicare ProResults for about 4 years now, but the brush heads I&#x27;ve just received don&#x27;t compare at all to the ones I used to get. They are extremely soft and won&#x27;t snap attach to the base unit unlike the past ones. More over, after using it for one week, they&#x27;re in worse shape than the brush heads I&#x27;ve worn down for many months. Either the manufacturer created defective latest batch or they are very convincing fakes. The packaging looked brand legitimate although different from the past ones - narrower vertical packaging of two on top and one at bottom, as to 3 side-by-side older packaging. I&#x27;m going to go to a local store to find the genuine (older?) ones I&#x27;m more familiar with, as these will get trashed. I won&#x27;t be ordering online anymore.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, these are identical to the original head that came with the tooth brush---no complaints from me.</li>
            <li> These heads are almost certainly counterfeit.  Almost as soon as my wife and I put these on our toothbrushes, the bristles started to fray (some even pulled out) and began becoming compressed.  In a week, these heads looked like they had been used for months.  Would strongly recommend purchasing from a reputable retailer where you can be sure of their provenance.</li>
            <li> They work really well.  I like this size so much better than the compact heads. :)  I would recommend these to my friends.</li>
            <li> They worked perfectly even though I&#x27;m always skeptical.</li>
            <li> Philips&#x27; brush head quality has gone downhill. These heads are wobbly on the brush. They stay on just fine, but they don&#x27;t compare to the ones available four years ago.</li>
            <li> The bristles are so soft I cannot use them. I bought these cause I wanted to save some money, but that money has now been wasted and I have to buy another set.</li>
            <li> I like that the design doesn&#x27;t waste a big half circle of plastic on every brush like my previous Sonic Care did. The only drawback on these is that they do not last that long - maybe a couple months at the very most. I use this twice a day until it feels like I just stepped out of a dentist&#x27;s office after a cleaning. I love these kinds of toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> It was simple to order on line, and I will do it again! The brushes arrived in great shape and just as good as at Costco! Came in record time.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare tooth brush is wonderful.  However daily use causes the heads to fray and get too soft.  Finding replacement heads at a very reasonable cost is great.  They also seem to last longer, though I have no way to prove that.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe these are Philips Sonicare brush heads, but they do fit and look official with a part number printed on them. After only a few days, the bristles became frayed, spread out and too soft to use. Each brush head should last for at least 3 months, based on my past experience. This is a ripoff. Don&#x27;t buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a similar 3-pack at Bath &amp; Beyond yesterday. The list price is $31.95. With a 20% discount coupon and a $5 rebate, it ends up being cheaper than the one I bought from Amazon ($25.95).</li>
            <li> Good brushes, hold up pretty good as long as you don&#x27;t apply to much force (which you should not do anyway). All in a good product.</li>
            <li> I like these small ones so much better than those lunky big ones from a few years ago. Glad they changed the style...it&#x27;s much easier to clean!</li>
            <li> Sonicare brushing saved my gums and teeth. I love my Sonicare toothbrush. These replacements should last several months. Need to change about every 3 months. Same as a regular toothbrush. I will never go back to a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Brushes were too soft and started fraying within a week. Both my wife and I had the same experience. Bought some at walmart and have had them in for two weeks w/ no issues.</li>
            <li> These replacement brush heads work as advertised.  They do not last as long as expected but do a good job before they wear out.  I get a month and a half to two months per head but I brush quite vigorously</li>
            <li> More cost efficient in the 3-pack, these sonic brush-heads last a while and leave your teeth feeling smooth.  A good brush for those with braces.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted for my Sonicare, it came to me fast, and and it was a good price!</li>
            <li> I have never been more disappointed in a product ordered from Amazon. I&#x27;m pretty sure I got the shaft on this one. OK, the package looks identical to the one that I purchased from a grocery store. They look relatively the same but in comparison, the bristles of these are slightly lighter in color. There are some large numbers etched into the front of these, the ones format he store have small print. Now, I put the brush head on my Sonicare Toothbush, turned it on and the thing went flying off and across the bathroom! Well, lets try it again, put it on, turn it on, vibrated right off again. I&#x27;m giving the brush heads the benefit of the doubt so I switch heads and try it again...same thing. I also purchased 2 packages as gifts, so I call the recipient and ask them to try these out on her toothbrush...what an embarrassment when she told me that her&#x27;s also instantly vibrated off of her toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several attempts to get the thing to stay together I finally hold pressure on it with my hand. The brushes where extremely soft, too soft to actually clean your teeth, I can not say it enough how disappointed I am with these toothbrush heads. I would like to say that I got a bad package, but I purchased (3) three packs and all were the same. I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare toothbrushes for the last 5-6 years and this is the first and the last time I purchase them from the internet. Very upset with this purchase, they are going back, used or not. I&#x27;m pretty sure these are knockoffs of the original.</li>
            <li> I received counterfeit brush heads that do not work on the HealthyWhite brush and I see from other user reviews now that many others have also been ripped off.  Amazon and its sellers need to stop selling the counterfeits after so many people have complained for so long.  Take a look at the brush head closely and you&#x27;ll see not only a bolder font where it says &amp;#34;ProResults&amp;#34; (compared to the real brush heads with have that in a finer font, but even the model number &amp;#34;HX6013&amp;#34; is missing from the counterfeit brush heads.  I&#x27;ve reported this to  Amazon and the seller, Blue Bulls Ranch, and I&#x27;m awaiting a reply.  Do NOT buy these until Amazon and its sellers stop selling the fakes.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and seem to be cheaper than in the stores.  Its very hard to find the brushes for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I chose the rating that I did because the sonicare toothbrush that I bought them for is a great one.  Not one of the newer ones but still good none the less.</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes in April 2013. They fit the brush poorly and I figured it was a &amp;#34;bad batch&amp;#34; but was too lazy to return them.  I only found out much later after I went to the store and bought them that the brushes from Amazon were counterfeit garbage yet they were packaged in Phillips Sonicare packaging!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have an issue with generic products so long I know they are generic and they work, but counterfeit is unacceptable.  From now on I will go to the store and buy brush heads in person.  Amazon should be taking a closer look at whomever was the reseller in April 2013.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed by this toothbrush. It cleans very well, but I did not notice marked whiteness in my teeth.  I had not been to a dentist in six years, and within a month of using this brush my dentist said that my teeth looked excellent.  I would recommend the Sonicare highly.</li>
            <li> These were much better priced than at my local store and they work perfectly in my Sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I do not like the packaging. It is too difficult to open.</li>
            <li> I like my Sonicare. Best brushing results from a dental appliance I&#x27;ve found. Two minor nits: On/Off button is right where my thumb wants to go so I often turn off the machine while brushing. They say the heads last 3 months. No way. I get 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li> Until my new Sonicare HealthyWhite toothbush and this pack of replacement brushes arrived, I was not sure they worked together. They do. I&#x27;m now good for a year or two.</li>
            <li> Product came as 2-pack instead of 3.</li>
            <li> Because the Sonicare cycle commits to a longer brushing I am hopeful that it will mean less cavities in my teeth. I guess I won&#x27;t know until my next visit to the dentist.</li>
            <li> Have had a lot of problem finding replacements locally.  Yours fit the bill perfectly.</li>
            <li> I found these brushes to be a big step up from the previous Sonicare brushes. These ones are also less expensive, which is a big plus too. The only one thing that I have a problem with is the blue indicator strip that is \\&quot;supposed\\&quot; to let you know more-or-less when it&#x27;s time to change your brush head. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s only me but I find that the blue strip of bristles fade to white pretty darn fast. I just changed my brush for the second time since I got my new Flexcare toothbrush about five months ago. I&#x27;m only a month into the new brush head and it already went from blue to white indicating it&#x27;s time to replace it. I can tell you that I don&#x27;t brush hard and I do the two-minute &#x27;Clean&#x27; mode twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, based on my observations this particular added feature to the ProResults brush heads are inaccurate and would not recommend going by this to decide when it&#x27;s time to change heads. I also noticed that this blue indicator strip feature is not mentioned anywhere on the packaging or listed in the &#x27;product features&#x27; on this Amazon page. I find that a bit surprising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I was just thinking that maybe the reason for this may be from placing my brush head in the UV Sanitizer to be cleaned after every brushing, which is twice a day. Do you think the UV rays may be causing the blue indicator strip to fade away that much faster? ...I was wondering if anybody else has had this problem as well.</li>
            <li> Original brushhead that came with the toothbrush lasted a long time, but finally figured I should replace it. Had these less than month, and already the first replacement is flat, lost it&#x27;s shape, now moving on to the next one. Not nearly the same quality as the original brushhead. Beware.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered the ProResults brush heads from Amazon before and these are not the same quality. These brush heads are softer and poor quality. They&#x27;re already worn down after just 1 week! I may have to purchase my next brush heads from my dentist.</li>
            <li> would not buy it again as the bristles just gave out after a few uses as compared to the one purchased at cvs</li>
            <li> I bought this brush head before. I was fine so I reorder the brush head. I even purchased four boxes. But this time, the brush heads are fake, the brush hair is so week, not hard enough. The entire brush was flatten after one week. I guess the sell real replacement brush but the also sell fake one.</li>
            <li> Good buy and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Counterfeit and fake do not buy!</li>
            <li> I love brushing with Sonicare.  Teeth feel cleaner, almost like walking out of the dentist&#x27;s office, just without having a stranger stuff their hands in your mouth.</li>
            <li> This item fits the Sonicare base (HX6950) I have perfectly.</li>
            <li> fits the base. less expensive. does a good job.  Again stupid that I have word requirement.  I like it. Is that good enough?</li>
            <li> Work well with the Philips Sonicare toothbrush! My teeth have never look so clean! Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I purchased these &amp;#34;Philips&amp;#34; brand replacement heads rather than a &amp;#34;aftermarket&amp;#34; brand because I wanted the original brush heads that came with my base unit.  These heads are terrible!!  After the first couple of uses the heads repeatedly come off as you are trying to brush.  This happens OVER and OVER until you just finally give up trying to make it stay on the base unit!&lt;br /&gt;They are a complete waste of money and &amp;#34;Philips&amp;#34; should be very worried as I see by the bad reviews that I am only one of MANY people that have had the same BAD experience with these fake replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love my toothbrush but, NOT these counterfeit replacement heads!!  Don&#x27;t waste your money on them!!&lt;br /&gt;S.F.M.</li>
            <li> I can confirm what many other have said about these brush heads - they are definitely not the same heads that came with the brush when I bought it new.  These bristles are softer, shorter, and less dense than the originals.  I&#x27;m not sure if they are ripoffs or if Philips changed the design.  I haven&#x27;t used them yet so I can&#x27;t speak to performance.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that a few of the bristles fell off within a week of use.  I&#x27;ve started another one, and so far so good.</li>
            <li> I did suspect if this type of head could match my HX6932 Philips Sonicare toothbrush. Knowing that Amazon has the best return policy, I took the risk with the lowest price I could ever find. Yes, no doubt, it is working perfectly right now. So for those of you have the same type of toothbrush and maybe the same question, please be rest assured-this is EXACTLY what you are looking for.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads do the job, but it always amazes me how expensive they are. I guess I really have no choice in the matter unless I want to give up my sonicare.</li>
            <li> I have the Sonicare ProResults toothbrush but could not find replacement brushes anywhere in stores. I was thankful to find the product at Amazon. I don&#x27;t know if you aqcuired the product [[ASIN:B000WHNI2I Philips Sonicare ProResults HX6013 Brush Head Standard 3pk]]    as \\&quot;seconds\\&quot; from Philips or if it was intended to be perfect.  One of the brushes does not \\&quot;connect\\&quot; to the handle at all. The other two brushes are working but the identifier colored ring does not snap into place. It hangs loose and leaves a gap between the brush and the handle. We will continue using the two brushes but already I can see the brushes are not going to last as long as the the original brushes lasted. Is there any way to pass this review on to Phillips? I would appreciate a response. Thank you. Peg Riley</li>
            <li> The heads work great. I&#x27;m just bummed that they are so expensive.  Seems unfair that to take care of your teeth they charge you and arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> Product is just what I expected. Shipping took longer than usual...I think because of a mistake at USPS.</li>
            <li> I WONDER IF THIS PRODUCT IS A FROM THE ORIGINAL MANUFACTURER????&lt;br /&gt;BRUSH HEAD DOES NOT SEEM UP TO QUALITY</li>
            <li> This pack I purchased has stray bristles that look like they have unfolded and make the brushing experience a bit less enjoyable.</li>
            <li> High quality at a good price.</li>
            <li> Love sonicare, they take all the guesswork out of brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li> Love the sonicare system and these replacements work just fine.  Prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> Appears to be the perfect replacement and fits well.  Showed up in Philips packaging.</li>
            <li> Makes me want to smile more.</li>
            <li> The brushes deteriorated fast and appear to be counterfeit.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think these are authentic ProResult brush. The one I purchased at Philips store has serial number on the brush neck and these don&#x27;t; The brush is too firm; The blue color on the top of the brush is designed to fade as you use to remind you when you should change the brush, and these brushes don&#x27;t fade! I don&#x27;t like them but since they can fit my handle and they are not total wastes of money, 2 stars.</li>
            <li> Softer, more reach; can&#x27;t ask for more. Seem more durable than older models. Sonicare seems to improve its products all the time. Now that&#x27;s a nice trend. Wish they made a travel oral irrigator...</li>
            <li> I used to get these Sonicare brush heads at Costco, but with the new items pushing out the old, they stopped carrying them. So, here I am on Amazon looking for them. I went with the Philips brand because I didn&#x27;t want to hassle with sub-par product (i.e. other reviewers say off-brand comes apart or doesn&#x27;t fit right, etc.). These work like they should. Wish they would put 4 in a pack, however and lower the price.</li>
            <li> My dentist&#x27;s office wanted to sell me a package of 2 for basically the same price as this 3 pack. I used to brush with a plain toothbrush but it really is not as good as using a sonicare. It takes a while to get used to the fact that you don&#x27;t have to move this brush all around as you go over your mouth. The point is to let the head do the work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Sonicare user for over ten years and I&#x27;ve purchased numerous replacement heads. This is the first time I&#x27;ve had three brushes wear out in less than 10 weeks. In the past, I&#x27;ve used the same Sonicare brush head for 6 months without a significant reduction in the brush&#x27;s effectiveness. When started using the first brush in the pack I noticed that the bristles were softer than brushes that I had used in the past. Nevertheless, for the first two weeks the brush did a fairly good job cleaning my teeth (I brush twice daily). However, by the beginning of the third week I noticed that the bristles were already wearing down, and towards the end of the third week the bristles showed significant signs of wear. What was really disturbing, though, was that my teeth didn&#x27;t feel clean. My bottom teeth continued to feel \\&quot;gritty\\&quot; no longer how many times I went over them with the brush. This was extremely disappointing as I have never experienced this with a Sonicare toothbrush.  I thought (hoped) that this was just a defective head, but the remaining two heads in the pack followed the same pattern. $16.50 for three heads that last only 9 weeks is unacceptable! Sonicare electric toothbrushes have been such great products, I truly hope this is not a ploy by Sonicare to spur sales of replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li> These did not fit the brush head as they were supposed to.  With a little fiddling, they seem to work though.  And the brush seems to wear out quickly.  I will not be buying these again from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have ordered Phillips Sonicare replacement brushheads off of Amazon before and they have been fine. This time however, the bristles come off while brushing- EVERY TIME. It&#x27;s actually really gross. I feel like I need to brush with a different toothbrush after brushing with the sonicare to get all the bristles off my teeth and tongue.&lt;br /&gt;Will NOT buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are an imitation/ knock off. They slide on to the post with no resistance and then as you brush they fall off due to the vibration generated because the hole is too big.. I compared the new ones to the previous heads I purchased from Bed Bath and Beyond and the new ones do not compare. The color of the bristle are close in color but there are no identifying numbers on the new heads but all of the previous heads that I have used had numbers around the lower edge.  I am very disappointed with this purchase and wished I had looked earlier instead of waiting to use them because I would have asked for my money back.  Now I&#x27;m out of the purchase fee and three new brush heads due to this purchase.</li>
            <li> Real sonicare brushes</li>
            <li> Cheap, don&#x27;t fit into toothbrush properly (they fall off).  Regrettable purchase.</li>
            <li> The brush heads I received were generic knockoffs of the actual brush heads. These were in the same packaging, but the fit is loose and the quality nowhere near the official brush heads. DO NOT BUY THESE!!!!!</li>
            <li> Sonicare is the only way to brush, anything else is primitive.</li>
            <li> I love my sonic care toothbrush, but it is getting hard to find the brush heads at a reasonable price.  I am happy to find them reasonably priced through your website.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best toothbrush for a totally clean mouth. I wouldn&#x27;t stop using Sonicare. It truly makes you confident all around.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush heads. I only with they came in smaller packs of two.</li>
            <li> Good quality OEM equipment.</li>
            <li> I purchased these heads because of the price and the fact that they were Phillips brand.  When first using them they seemed to make an odd humming noise which the original heads did not make.  Out of the 3 heads in the pack, 2 of them made this noise and were quite loud.       I also noticed that the blue use indicator seemed to run down faster than the original heads.  I do not know if these were a fake brand, or a reject set that was not sent to stores, but I would not purchase this same set again.</li>
            <li> What can I say?  It goes with my Sonicare toothbrush which is awesome.  My dental exams/cleanings have been much better since I started using this product.  These replacement brush heads work great and I am pleased with the results.  I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I have a very small mouth, and the compact size generally works well for me (I ordered some with my original handle purchase).  However, for this style brush refill, the standard size works better.  BTW, I gave away a brand new Oral-B spinbrush-style brush because the brushheads were uncomfortably large, so I&#x27;m not kidding about the small mouth.  And Oh! how I love the newer style brushes; much easier to remove and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;09/08/12 - The most recent batch of brushes has a VERY snug fit on the stem of the handle; I wonder if they (whoever actually makes these) have changed suppliers or something.  I removed a buildup of hard water deposits from the stem and that helped, but they&#x27;re still difficult to set and remove.</li>
            <li> These brushes are perfect for the new Sonicare toothbrush.  Much cheaper and easier to use than the brush heads for the older model Sonicare.</li>
            <li> These are just what the dentist ordered: replacement heads for my Sonicare.  They fit, just as stated.  This was the cheapest way to buy these that I could find.  No one had them cheaper online, and in stores...forget it.  Not even close.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the fast service from Amazon. The product was exactly as I had ordered. Thanks again for your excellent response.</li>
            <li> The first one I used was good, but then neither of the other two would stay on my toothbrush when I was brushing. They&#x27;d just wiggle loose part way through. I am now using one of my wife&#x27;s &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; brush heads so it appears that the toothbrush is still fine. I was very disappointed because these aren&#x27;t cheap :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this electric toothbrush for years now (was X-mas present) and finally got tired of paying too much money at local stores for one replacement head. Found this 3-pack, which is about 1/2 the price at big box stores (I know, I&#x27;ve bought a 3pack there too...), and it is an excellent price, shipped fast, and works wonderfully. I will buy these online from now on and recommend everyone else does too!</li>
            <li> The replacement brush 3-pack for the Philips Sonicare are $30 and up in stores. I was able to order at half the price and with the automatic reorder I requested, I don&#x27;t have to worry about reordering when mine are wore down. Free shipping! Lowest price guaranteed! The Philips Sonicare brush is of high quality and with the ease of reordering brush heads through Amazon, I am happy!</li>
            <li> I got this toothbrush as a birthday present for myself last year.  I think that the brushes do a great job on keeping my teeth clean and it is very easy to use and the brushes have a good wear indicator on them.  Overall, a very good product.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind a little splashing then this large head is good and gets the job done fast. Just wish it were cheaper.</li>
            <li> Great but expensive.  Why so expensive?  Because they can, that&#x27;s why.  Just starting to see after market brands around.  I&#x27;ll have to give them a try...</li>
            <li> I also seem to be a victim of counterfeit brush heads. The first brush I used from the package worked fine, but when I replaced it with the second one, I noticed that it did not fit as snug and would fall off the base when I used it. Same with the third one. Now I&#x27;ll have to pay even more money ordering from Bed Bath and Beyond (thank you to those who mentioned it), but at least I&#x27;ll know that they&#x27;re authentic.</li>
            <li> We purchased the Sonicare years ago and always buy the standard size for adults.  It is a very nice toothbrush and I highly recommend it with the sanitizer.</li>
            <li> they are what they are</li>
            <li> The brushes are good quality for my electric toothbrush and it was offered at a competitive price.</li>
            <li> I forgot why I moved away from these heads, and loved the &#x27;diamond clean&#x27; head as soon as I tried it!  These are very very soft, so much so that pressing them onto my teeth the hard plastic hits teeth too!!!  Next time I will spend the extra money for the diamond clean ones...maybe even before I open the second head...</li>
            <li> These are very likely not genuine HX6013 brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have noted in the review section, they do not lock in place properly. When compared to genuine brush heads a nub of plastic is missing from the interior which prevents it from locking in place. Worse yet, the brush quality is far inferior. The bristles are abnormally soft when compared to genuine HX6013 brush heads. They are also cut very unevenly. This makes the product useless at transmitting vibrations and functioning as a proper &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; toothbrush should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This combination of errors, and a comparison to brush heads I just purchased in a brick and mortar shop lead me to believe that these are clever knock-offs, not just representative of some drop in quality on Philips manufacturing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearly many people seem to be happy with this product if you check the positive reviews. However, buyer beware, as you appear to be rolling the dice when you order from this seller.</li>
            <li> Good product and price</li>
            <li> These were not real Sonicare brush heads. I&#x27;ve used Sonicare toothbrushes for over a decade, and I love them. But something was very wrong about these brush heads. I put the first one on my toothbrush, and found it odd that the cap was nearly impossible to remove, and the brush head had to be forced onto my toothbrush. Then it just didn&#x27;t feel right - the bristles felt too soft, and my teeth didn&#x27;t feel clean. After using the thing for a couple of weeks, it finally occurred to me that these brush heads might be counterfeit. So I compared them to one I&#x27;d gotten from another source, and saw that the bristle material was different - softer, a different color, and they poked out at a little different angle. The blue indicator bristles showed no sign of changing color. And the brush head was wearing differently than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this two stars because Amazon was great about taking them back. I bought the brush heads through a 3rd party (R&amp;MX), and the order was &amp;#34;fulfilled by Amazon.&amp;#34; Once I finally realized these were not real Sonicare brush heads, i just sent an email to Amazon explaining what was going on, and Amazon credited my visa the same evening. Thanks, Amazon, for making that right!</li>
            <li> A lot of widely varying reviews. My brushes arrived with normal Sonicare packaging and are obviously legit. I feel there may be manipulations going on but I don&#x27;t want to sound paranoid. And I will save my wrath for something more important.</li>
            <li> All Sonic care products are great quality Philips products and I recommend them highly. Far superior to manual tooth brush, this product is very effective in maintaining healthy teeth.</li>
            <li> Amazon was the only source I could find for our HX6013 Sonic toothhbrushes,  Our dentist kept trying to sell us a newer model  Why get a new model when the old one still works.</li>
            <li> What is there to say about a toothbrush head?  I have bought this same product 3 times because I just keep replacing the same heads on the same toothbrush.  My teeth feel nice and clean after brushing and these heads to not wear out particularly quickly.</li>
            <li> Comfortable brush head.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what some people are talking about. I have now bought these several times. If they aren&#x27;t from the manufacturer, they are too close to differentiate. They&#x27;re perfect, high-quality, and just what they&#x27;re supposed to be.</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Good price- good product-</li>
            <li> These are great to keep you teeth clean. Amazon is a little high, but when you figure in the free shipping, perfect!</li>
            <li> Very poor quality. Purchased on/about 8/20/14 &amp; am already on the 3rd head. Bristles frayed in less than 1 weeks use &amp; I am not a heavy brusher.</li>
            <li> The product fits and works great.</li>
            <li> I really like these better than the &amp;#34;bulkier E Series&amp;#34; replacement head. Not as messy as the bulkier ones.  I oly use the &amp;#34;sonicare&amp;#34; products.</li>
            <li> My cheaper to buy these online then in the store.  They fit and they last.  I am glad I bought the electric toothbrush and the replacements.</li>
            <li> These are great for everyday use though Philips Sonicare have recently brought out sensitive toothbrush heads so I&#x27;ll be trying those as well.  Still a great product, especially if you don&#x27;t need sensitive brush heads.</li>
            <li> This product says it is Care by Mail - USA, but it ships from the UK.  I ordered on January 30th.  It arrived today February 20th.  This is very misleading that it states USA but ships from the UK.  The heads appear to be the same as those made in the USA but they are not made in the USA.  BUYER BEWARE!</li>
            <li> Present for my son in NYC. He needed and like them. Delivery went fine. The toothbrush replacements work perfectly and he was pleased with this gift.</li>
            <li> The quality is really poor!! NOT REAL Philips Sonicare brush head AT ALL but charge for it. This is NOT NICE!!!</li>
            <li> These do not appear to be authentic Phillips brand brush heads and are too soft, look completely worn out after about 1 weeks use.  I would definitely like a refund or to exchange for the real thing.</li>
            <li> These work just fine on my Sonicare brush</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare products for years and my dentist checks ups are the proof that the Sonicare works.  According to my dentist, I have great looking teeth, and very healthy gums as well and it&#x27;s in large part to my Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to anyone looking to improve the oral hygiene, and in the process take great care of their teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABM</li>
            <li> Although its been along time since I ordered this but it was perfect ,it was the original and perfect ,thanks</li>
            <li> works perfect good price shipped immediately.  These are usually ridiculously expensive. now I can just use these and replace more frequently because they are cheaper and they ship so quickly!  Great!</li>
            <li> Not original Philips pro results equipment, doesn&#x27;t seat on brush properly. Has about a quarter inch space and looks generic.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t made right. All three of them fall off, even from the vibrations. Don&#x27;t order these. Get the ones made by Philips if you can.</li>
            <li> This does not look like a genuine product. In just few days the brush became to deteriorate - curling in all directions and quickly became unusable.Also the packaging looks different from usual packaging of such items. I now regret I haven&#x27;t made a picture of both the used brush and the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;After using all 3 in an unusual short period of time I bought another pack from a local brick and mortar store - and THOSE are like the brushes I used to have.</li>
            <li> The brush heads keep detaching from my FlexCare+ tooth brush while brushing. Because they&#x27;re loose on the base, the vibrations are really subdued and I can&#x27;t get a good clean. Total waste of money here. Judging by other reviewers of this product I suspect I was shipped counterfeits. Really disappointing.</li>
            <li> fake brush heads.  After one use the bristles came loose.  The graphic on the boxing was printed on.  The print the bush head is obviously forged.</li>
            <li> These are just replacement brushes.  They are just like the original.  They hold up well, and they are high quality. I&#x27;ve had no problems with them.</li>
            <li> Overall excellent price for these. I looked around, and these were even cheaper than Kohls...</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is expensive enough at $140, having to change the brush head every 3 months is very expensive!!!!  I was thrilled to find this seller selling sets of 3 brush heads for close to $21! Thanks!  Shipping was quick as well... Another Thank You!  Hope the price will get lower over the years....</li>
            <li> I bought the standard size ProResults brush heads for my Sonicare Flexcare.  I was actually looking for the compact heads but bought the standard heads because they were less expensive.  The standard heads are not as wide as a typical manual toothbrush head.  They are a little pointed at the tip, which is great for getting behind the back molars.  They are soft and comfortable.  Most importantly, they fit my Flexcare.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers that say the price seems high for this tooth brush. However, since I gladly pay for it and believe that it provides superior cleaning of my teeth I can&#x27;t complain. The best way to drive the price down on this product is to not buy it. :) Supply and demand works every time.</li>
            <li> These worked as expected but can now find them at Big Box stores. It is nice to be able to order them and not have to go out to buy them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a toothbrush head and works just fine.  Didn&#x27;t get 5 stars because the indicator bristles fade after about 6-8 weeks but I use it for 3 months before replacing.</li>
            <li> Of the set of 3 brush heads I bought from Amazon, the brush began to &amp;#34;spread out&amp;#34; within 2 weeks of use.  This was the same for all 3 pieces in the set.  I then bought the next set of replacement brush heads from Target and the first head has lasted 2 months so far.  I cannot tell whether the Amazon ones were counterfeit or there had been a product improvement by Philips; the markings on the 2 sets are different.  However, I&#x27;m inclined to buy only from Target from now on.</li>
            <li> The price is right - oh that was a game show :&amp;#62;)</li>
            <li> Look if you have the Philips Sonicare, you need these brushes, and I might add they are pretty good and leave you feeling you have really cleaned your teeth and hence my rating. However, the price of brush heads have gone way up. There is no reason for this apart for pure greed.Leaves me thinking well I may need to soon swop brands to bring down the overall cost, yes I will loose money as I will have needless base unit - but hey these brushes are leaving a hole my pocket and wanted to stop cavities.</li>
            <li> These Phillips sonicare  replacement heads are great. I purchased the sonicare electric brush, I love it! Feels like you have had your teeth cleaned at the dentist office every day.It&#x27;s nice to have the replacement heads to pop on about every 3 months,when the old one needs replacing. Also when you order at Amazon, you get the best price!</li>
            <li> The refills do exactly what they are supposed to:  provide replacement for the Sonicare brush, which is itself a great tool.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the brush heads, but I returned the product to get the Oral-b which I like much better.</li>
            <li> How long have these sonicare toothbrushes been out?!?  Isn&#x27;t it time the price dropped down to about $5 bucks for a three pack, I mean, the price is ridiculous if you know how much each one of these cost to make!</li>
            <li> I really love my sonicare toothbrush but the replacement brushes at the store are just way too expensive Im glad I was able to get three replacements for the price of one I also ordered this product and received it quickly.</li>
            <li> Great place to get your replacement sonicare brushheads - can&#x27;t beat the price with subscribe and save! My husband and I have noticed a dramatic improvement in our dental visits since starting using the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> These Sonicare brushes was just as stated. The price could have been better. Could be the name accounts for most of it.</li>
            <li> These brush heads seem to last longer/perform better than with past electric brushes I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve been perfectly content going through about one head every quarter, which at ~$20-30/year isn&#x27;t bad! As opposed to my previous situation, which was about 1 head every 2 months for a total expense of ~$50 a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the option for smaller/larger heads as well, and Amazon definitely has the best price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints at all. Good quality, good value, good stuff.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and was exactly what I ordered and expected. Very Satisfied, I would definitely order again from this company.</li>
            <li> They are exepensive.... but this is something where I take \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; into consideration.  The toothbrush heads DO NOT last more then two months though (I brush 2-4 times a day) but they keep my teeth extremely white and clean in comparison to any other standard toothbrush.  When the blue starts to fade after a few weeks, you can still get another 2-3 weeks out of it.</li>
            <li> Actually, we never really learned much about toothbrushing in dental school. Oh well. As to this product? It&#x27;s adequate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like my Sonicare toothbrush. I like that it is more sleek and trim than my wife&#x27;s e-Series. I like that 3 of these heads cost about as much as 2 of the e-Series heads. Overall, these heads do a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My complaint is on the design of these heads and the toothbrush in general. These heads leave a gap between them and the handle of the toothbrush where toothpaste residue can easily accumulate. It isn&#x27;t too much of a hassle to pull it off every week or so and clean, but it seems like the problem is a little bit deeper than that. This gap allows buildup to accumulate around the rubber diaphragm that surrounds the vibrating metal core. A few weeks ago when pulling the head off my toothbrush and cleaning the residue out, I noticed that this residue/bacteria has been infiltrating or absorbing into that rubber diaphragm. The rubber has odd nodules on it. So it appears that the rubber is not impervious to penetration by bacteria. It may only be a matter of time before the rubber breaks down due to this penetration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, while the design of these heads and the toothbrush is nice, it does require continual removal and cleaning. This may prevent the above situation. The design of the e-Series, while bulkier, does not have this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it is difficult to remember to change your heads so I put a reminder in my calendar if that helps. Otherwise the heads from the subscribe-and-save just pile up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review was helpful. If there are questions or if there is anything I can clarify, please leave me a comment.</li>
            <li> Love these they work perfect.</li>
            <li> I purchased these brush heads several months ago and they were great. My second purchase - not so much. A brush head that typically lasts for months was worn out in less than 2 weeks. All 3 of them were the same this time around. I would have returned them and raised the issue to Amazon, but I&#x27;d already thrown away the box. Beware of purchasing these.</li>
            <li> Just what we wanted, the same thing but new!  It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> It is the typical Magellan product. Not bad, but not outstanding. The routes are not always logical, and sometimes really stupid. Google Maps and anything on a smart phone would create smarter routes, but this thing does not need the internet. It is a nice backup in places where you have no signal, but if it disagrees with your smartphone, just disregard its instructions.</li>
            <li> Super product.  My dentist recommended Sonicare a long time ago and remarks each time I see him how good my teeth look.  Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare, but the heads are way too pricey.  Also, one in the package was faulty and didn&#x27;t stay in the brush base for the full use time so I had to discard it earlier than promised.  I do like the way the bristles change color when it&#x27;s time to replace them -- too bad it cost so much to do so :(.</li>
            <li> Brush head seems smaller then my previous order.  Maybe I ordered the wrong size??</li>
            <li> these work as well as the originals.&lt;br /&gt;I love the color strands that indicate when it is time to replace.&lt;br /&gt;These are just the right size. Nott too small , not too large</li>
            <li> How do you review a replacement head. They the same as the ones that came with the Sonicare. So I got it. Its fine.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy.  Fake.... !!!  Broke my charger after using this it.  Save your money, save your time.  Buy at Costco.</li>
            <li> The product came exactly as advertised.  The packaging was sealed and in good shape, and the product itself is exactly like the original that came with my toothbrush.  I&#x27;ve been using one for a few weeks now and it&#x27;s holding up very well.</li>
            <li> Product is fine. Reason for 3 star rating is because they were a little pricey. I frequently find these on sale locally for less.</li>
            <li> Lasts about six-months, but I use these only on my teeth and have separate manual toothbrush to brush tongue. Wifey uses hers on tongue and teeth and it lasts only about three-months. I drop these into a water glass with denture cleaner about once a week to clean them and my manual toothbrush. They hold up well to the denture cleaner too, come out like new.</li>
            <li> This is a great value for 3 brush heads.  I couldn&#x27;t even find the brush heads for the PRO in the store, so this is really convenient.</li>
            <li> Continue to use these with the electric toothbrush &amp; my dentist is pleased @ the overall improvement</li>
            <li> The brush head says, &amp;#34;Sonicare&amp;#34; on it in the picture, but when I received the 3 pack, it says, &amp;#34;Pro Results&amp;#34; on the head.  Not sure why the picture doesn&#x27;t state that.  I just used it last night for the first time.  Not sure if other reviewers have a different Sonicare than I do but no problems with it.  The head just snaps into place.  I decided to buy this online rather than in the store because it&#x27;s at least $10 cheaper.  For now, it seems to do what it&#x27;s supposed to do so I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> These toothbrush heads are fake! I ordered them online because it was hard to find them in Target City, since it is smaller than the normal Target stores. I was so excited to be ordering more online with Amazon Prime, but when I got them it was such a disappointment. These brush heads are way too soft to be sonicare. Also, they are not as pictured either. The word sonicare on them is blurry and there is also numbers on it (I have never seen numbers on the real brushes and I have had my toothbrush for over 2 years now)...anyways, I felt kinda crazy, but I called Amazon to return them and since I already opened it they just gave me a refund, but I still think it is awful and a waste of my time to buy fake products online. I hope Amazon flags this seller and doesn&#x27;t use them again. I mean I would much rather use my older brush head than use these. There is something nice and exciting about brushing your teeth with a new brush head..feels like you just went to the dentist how clean my teeth get. These fake ones are worse than any regular tooth brush I have ever used. It&#x27;s like whats the point?! Why brush my teeth?! Thank you Amazon for the refund. I am writing this for others so they don&#x27;t waste their time with this seller. I will be buying new REAL tooth brush heads elsewhere from now on.</li>
            <li> My sonicare is great &amp; Phillips has honored the warranty wonderfully. With free super saver shipping, these are a good price for the &#x27;consumable&#x27; part, and it&#x27;s a convenient way to get them.</li>
            <li> i found the heads very good but way to pricey. the cost is so high, you might not want them.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy the 3 pack since I was unsure if it would fit the toothbrushing unit but I wanted to get the best deal so I took a chance.  They work well and the different colored rings around the bottom of the brushing heads help me know which head belongs to which family member.  My oldest son uses the gray one and my youngest one uses the blue one and they come on and off fairly easily.  All you have to do is pull upwards on the toothbrush head and it comes off...then you slide the other head back down onto the shaft and there you go!  Pretty good buy after all!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I thought I would save a few bucks and buy the Target knock-off. Learn from my mistake! Target&#x27;s version lasts only a few days, then the fastening mechanism loses its grip, and the heads fly off during operation! (Yes, I bought the right ones.) I am going back to Subscribe and Save of the real thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Sonicare toothbrush for years and love it.  Never had any problem with the replacement brushes but the brushes in this package would not insert into the toothbrush.  I called Sonicare and they confirmed they were the correct brushes for the toothbrush, and said they obviously were faulty.  Amazon gave me credit for them.  I received another set and they work fine.  Just strange.</li>
            <li> Great replacements without having to go to the store.  Whats the downside?</li>
            <li> Great price for these - great product</li>
            <li> These are counterfeits. They only last a week or so before the bristles are no longer stiff enough to brush my teeth. Note to self: go buy replacement heads at Costco.</li>
            <li> arrived quickly and as described.  Good price for this product.</li>
            <li> These replacement brushes are exactly what I needed. The price is good and my dentist recommended them. Now I am sure to replace them every three months!</li>
            <li> merchandise was as advertised, and arrived in good time</li>
            <li> Sonicare has proven to be effective in promoting tooth/gum care. I have been using Sonicare for almost 5 years and I have never been more satisfied with any other toothbrush. The replacement heads are easy to find at Amazon at a cheaper price than what we have here on Guam...</li>
            <li> Had to buy new Sonicare toothbrush so went with the newer model using these brush heads.  I have found that these brush heads do not last as long as the older e-series brushes.  Although they are cheaper, if I had a choice I would have stayed with the older model if it had not broken.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads worked perfectly with my Sonicare 6712. They are the same as the original heads that came with the toothbrush. Only \\&quot;issue\\&quot; is that you will need to replace these heads more often than you would change a regular toothbrush. I would estimate that, at $17 for 3 heads, you will be spending $51-$60 on brush heads annually.</li>
            <li> Bristles fell out and brushes really stunk.. Absolutely junk!</li>
            <li> This product is not the standard size brush like it claims to be it is compact model. On top of that the packaging is different than normal and it doesn&#x27;t seem to fit on the tooth brush quite right. It makes me wonder if this is a counterfeit product. Do not buy</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare is a great product for excellent dental care. Recommended by our dentist, we&#x27;ve been using it for a few years now. It&#x27;s easy to use and does a much better job than the manual toothbrushes used for so many years. Replacing the standard brush every 90 days for each of us, allows us to keep the product at its maximum advantage.</li>
            <li> First time buyer this brushes and very disappointed of a quality. Not Philips. Just second week in use and bristles fell out already. Complete waste of money. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Bought a 3pk for my sonicare flexcare+ 6072/6950 brush model, fit perfectly and looks the same as my default old brush head that came with the toothbrush itself when I first bought it.</li>
            <li> You need this toothbrush! Just awesome your teeth will feel so clean! The brush heads last for a while and I cannot believe how clean my teeth feel!</li>
            <li> While these were inexpensive, after a couple of months of use I am concerned that they are not genuine Philips brush heads.  The blue indicator bristles never faded.  The rest of the bristles actually wore down, splayed out, and frizzed.  While they worked well enough at the beginning, they only lasted about a month.  The poor performance has me concerned about the authenticity of the product since I have always purchased brush heads from traditional brick &amp; mortar stores before.  This in turn makes me wonder about the materials and manufacturing standards.  I will not purchase this item again now that I need my next set of brush heads.</li>
            <li> These must be knock offs.  The bristles fell out after 2-3 days of use. Complete waste of money. I thought they were Philips Sonicare but they are not. Don&#x27;t be duped like I was. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> THIS IS FALSE ADVERTISING!!&lt;br /&gt;I received a generic set for the same price as branded product.  This item will be returned immediately.</li>
            <li> the brush head the original tooth brush came with had strong bristles and loved it so after 6 months of usage, it was time to get new brush heads and I went ahead and ordered these. After using one of the three brush heads only a couple of times, I had already damaged it and it looked like I had used it and abused it! I&#x27;m sad because i love my toothbrush but need to find the right bristles for it.</li>
            <li> Good product but a bit overpriced.</li>
            <li> The price for the three sonic brushes was the same as for only two at Target and Rite Aid.</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare ProResults HX6013 Brush Head Standard 3pk is the best dental product I ever used for dental hygine. I strongly recomended it</li>
            <li> Of course it&#x27;s a lot of money for a piece of plastic, but hey Philips has to make benefits on the supplies after discounting the initial electronic brush purchase.</li>
            <li> Well, they should be identical to what comes with the original toothbrush but somehow I have a feeling that they fit not as snug as the original two that came with the unit. That leads to a slight rattling/humming. Most people probably wouldn&#x27;t notice anything though - and perhaps it&#x27;s just my imagination... anyways, they clean the same and last the same.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and fits perfectly.  Free shipping and no taxes are a plus.  I can wait a week to save some extra cash.  Amazon&#x27;s free shipping is what I look for.</li>
            <li> Nothing special to write about. You get exactly whats shown. I like the product overall. I like that it comes with different colored rings at the base of the heads, as my wife and I share the same \\&quot;handle\\&quot; but different heads.</li>
            <li> My husband will only use these.  They are expensive, but they hold up pretty well with constant use.  He is happy, so I am happy!!</li>
            <li> The brush heads work great!</li>
            <li> These brush heads were useless and wore out in less than 1 month and the last one simply fell apart after about 2 weeks of use.  The last set of brushes I brought from Costco I might add contained 6 bushes and each one lasted for 6 months or more.</li>
            <li> Good and reliable product</li>
            <li> Finally got the right one.  It works well.</li>
            <li> I like it and a good price.  Second time i buy them.</li>
            <li> Product frayed after 5 uses. The bristle feels very soft than the original brush head. Overall, this product is counterfeit.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GOOD ORIGINAL REPLACEMENT THAT WORKS VERU GOOD.</li>
            <li> This product has worked very well for years.  Hasn&#x27;t saved any teeth, but You only have to brush the ones you want to keep.</li>
            <li> Simply the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  My dentist told me he wouldn&#x27;t be going to Hawaaii this year if everyone used this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand of toothbrush for about 5-6 years and have yet to be disappointed and now I make sure I always have refills and these were a great price!</li>
            <li> Love my sonicare toothbruh and these toothbrush heads are awesome and are priced right on Amazon. These last a long time and are much better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used Sonicare for several years now, and even though I am often late on getting my teeth cleaned, the dental hygienist always comments how little plaque I have.  And I&#x27;ve had no cavities in years.  I&#x27;ll never be without one of these units again... truly a product that delivers what it promises!</li>
            <li> Iam not real happy with  the supplies  we have received the last 2 times, its like the brushes are recycled , or second hand,they do not last as long at all. I have been disappointed with them, I have not complained, but, now is the time.  The bristles  break down very soon after starting to use them.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d have an easy time finding and buying the replacement heads so I purchase these replacement 3-pack because I felt they were a good deal. I like switching out the standard head for the compact head to better reach behind the teeth and in the back molars. Fine product.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a powerful brush, then use these heads.  The other tiny heads are great for nooks and crannies, but you cover more surface area with these bristles, meaning each tooth receives more brushing in the same time period.  Makes sense to me.</li>
            <li> These are just right for my electric toothbrush but so very expensive. When is the price coming down? Maybe i&#x27;ll shop for them at Costco.</li>
            <li> These work fine, fit the toothbrush fine.  The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that I didn&#x27;t realize these were firm bristles rather than soft.  I may have missed that in the description somewhere but I thought these were soft and found out when I started using them that they were substantially stiffer than expected.  They work just fine though other than that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with my new Flex-Care Plus toothbrush.  After about a month, I can feel an improvement in my gums.  In a cleaning last week, the hygienist also commented on the improvement.</li>
            <li> Theses toothbrush heads fit perfect. They work great and last a long time. I use them on the Sonicare Healthy White.</li>
            <li> I have given 4 stars because these brushes are expensive. They brush well and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> This was bought as a gift for me by my husband as a stocking filer. He is pretty useless at buying me gifts! Ok so these are practical and do the job, but not great as a gift for someone&#x27;s birthday! These are good replacement head though and I have had no problems with them. At least I got something useful lol.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if these are actually made by sonicare.  Every time I brush my teeth the bristles fall out.  Do not buy!!!</li>
            <li> Not the same quality as the brush which came with my Sonicare, but for the price, I do not mind replacing more often.</li>
            <li> The price is cheaper than the store, get them quick, and they are perfect-what more can I ask for? I like this company!</li>
            <li> I like the toothbrush (not better than my rotadent), but the order came quickly, and the brush heads were in the correct packaging for a much cheaper price than in the store.</li>
            <li> My mouth is small and I have ocasional bleedings so this is the best to go with your Philips sonicare. Overpriced ,in my opinion.</li>
            <li> bought these because they are much cheaper than the stores.. and they work just as good.  I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t the real deal.  Bristles started falling out within the first week.  Also, after a short period of time they became very loose and would slip off the handle repeatedly.  That makes brushing very difficult!  Ended up throwing them away and just buying them at the store.  Stay away from these fakes!</li>
            <li> These were not genuine  but a fake. The heads are loose and the bristles are extremely soft and get bent out of shape after 2 times of uses at most.I think there are a lot of fake Chinese sonicare heads to be wary of. Even a seller may not know as the packaging looks so real. But then again the seller usually does know his sources,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if these are defective or not really Sonicare brushes.  They are the right ones for my handle but one of them did not stay on the handle and the other 2 flattened out in only 2 days each making them unusable.&lt;br /&gt;I bought these because they were the cheapest but not too sure what happened.</li>
            <li> Work great. Best toothbrush on the market. Practically flosses for you. Would never use anything else now. This toothbrush will clean your teeth like the professionals at the dentist.</li>
            <li> These are packaged as regular brush heads but they are very soft. Would be great for sensitive teeth. They work fine and are a good price.</li>
            <li> This is not original product, it&#x27;s fake or very low quality copy of original brush. After several weeks this brush became non-usable compared to the original brush that came with device (when I bought it) which I used for several months before it needed a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this product!</li>
            <li> You gotta buy the original ProResults replacements.  Other off brand can damage your handle and/or your teeth.  Recently bought some off-brand and ended up injuring my gums.  Not going there anymore!  Only authentic replacements from now on!</li>
            <li> The bristles started to come out after first use.  First time I have had an issue with these heads.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this product 0 stars. DO NOT BUY! These are clearly counterfeit!!!</li>
            <li> absolutely horrible. Does not fit into the SONICARE</li>
            <li> Standard heads, good quality, worked as expected.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and buy these now.  I had a horrible experience with the knock off brands where while they fit initially, they start to become lose and come off in your mouth while brushing.  These fit great, and the real Phillips brand, and this price cannot be beat.  I highly recommend buying from this seller.</li>
            <li> They did not fit properly and using them was difficult.  They would stop vibrating on my toothbrush.  I ended up getting new heads much sooner.</li>
            <li> These were great a couple of years ago.  I have since switched to the diamond brushes, which I prefer.  However, if the diamonds weren&#x27;t available, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to order these again.</li>
            <li> These toothbrush heads don&#x27;t quite fit the Healthy White, despite being the &amp;#34;official&amp;#34; replacement heads for that brush. The base of the head does not go on easily, and when you remove the brush head from the brush, the base will separate and remain stuck on the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Philips customer service to let them know of this issue, and apparently it is a common problem of which they are aware.  I am not sure why they continue to sell these items at $10 per brush head, knowing they are an inferior product.</li>
            <li> Not only was this cheaper in price than the stores we shop at but the service and quality was great!!!</li>
            <li> Just received and is working as it states...Now the heads has colors that when it is time to change wears away. I believe this will really help me.</li>
            <li> Yes these work good for my sonicare toothbrush.  These are the same ones I always buy, just sometimes I order them in larger packs.  They are always a bit cheaper to order than to buy at the store.</li>
            <li> i wish i knew how great electric toothbrushes were years ago.  a great product.  i like being able to purchase the replacement heads online.  they&#x27;re a great product</li>
            <li> So convenient to find them at Amazon, was so tired of driving around town and asking everywhere I went... My family bought the toothbrush for me at radio shack two Christmas&#x27;s ago.. then I believe it was discontinued for another type...</li>
            <li> I buy these on Amazon and just about everything else because of the value.  It&#x27;s hard to say anything negative about it because it&#x27;s a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It is the most convenient and least expensive way to procure replacement brush heads for my Sonicare toothbrush and I use it whenever I need new brush heads.</li>
            <li> Works great.  That is all.  Have not tried other kinds to compare, but do love this one.  Nothing else to say, it just works.</li>
            <li> genuine parts, the full size, and work well. It was a good price. i&#x27;ve read that some of the generic ones don&#x27;t fit well so i look for the cheapest OEM ones.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t get these again. They break down after a month. Much prefer the Intercare, which last 4 months.</li>
            <li> Just wish they were less expensive.</li>
            <li> I have been using the sonicare for a few years now and have to have new brush heads occasionally I know it adds up but its sure better than the dentist</li>
            <li> I think these may be counterfeit. The original brushes lasted for a solid 6 months, These bristles have flattened out in less than half that time.</li>
            <li> These tooth brush heads give a good cleaning. First time sonciare brush user. Never used an electronic brush till now, but I love it. my teeth are squeaky clean. I bought the Philips Sonicare HX6921/30 Flexcare Plus Rechargeable Electric toothbrush here on Amazon back in August 2014. These tooth brush heads go with it well and give my gums a good cleaning.</li>
            <li> Perfect, and a good price!</li>
            <li> Work great brushes your teeth</li>
            <li> A little expensive for toothbrush heads but works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Although my unit was listed as accomadating these heads, they did not fit. Amazon was very cooperative in accepting them back.</li>
            <li> Product as advertised, recommend purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product; will be buying these in the future from now on.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended I get a Sonicare as it would help keep my teeth and gums in better shape between cleaning if I use it regularly.  I have used the ProResults brush heads for the past 18 months and they seem to do a better job than any of the other brush heads I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> These brushes work great. They are Sonic replacements, but less expensive then I can get locally. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I use these replacement brush heads with [[ASIN:B000UK2W4C Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush with Sanitizer]]. The best price I found is on Amazon. The price also goes down with subscription which can be canceled any time. I like the standard size rather than the compact which is a personal preference and depends on the size of your mouth. They all come with three different color rings that are easy to snap on or off which is useful in a household with more than one toothbrush that uses this type of brush head.</li>
            <li> Good Product.  Came quick. I think I like the Diamond Clean heads better.  I should know after using for a while</li>
            <li> What do you buy as a stocking stuffer when your kid&#x27;s top Christmas wish list item is an electric toothbrush? Thanks for making it affordable!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my Sonicare toothbrush and couldn&#x27;t live without it.  These replacement heads are the same as the one that came with it (I have a Healthy White model).  It is necessary to replace them regularly to make the most of the toothbrush.  I&#x27;ve heard others say they are too expensive but they&#x27;re worth every penny to me.</li>
            <li> When our old Sonicare toothbrush died (it lasted over 3 years) we replaced it with a new one and was happy to see that we could get the replacement brushes from Amazon.  The replacement brushes are exactly like the one that came with the new handle. I added these brushes to our automatic subscription to take advantage of the added discount and free shipping. I highly recommend these Sonicare brush heads for your Sonicare system.</li>
            <li> I have RA and this really helps with holding a toothbrush and reaching all areas of my teeth. I especially like the timed brushing to be sure I do get two minutes of brushing done.</li>
            <li> Great product, packaged in original packaging and good pricing! Shipped very quickly and we are happy with the overall experience. Thanks!</li>
            <li> kind of pricey....but it really gets in between the teeth and gum lines.  For you dentists out there, it has really solved my gingivitis problems......I would never go back to a regular tooth brush.........and it cleans your teeth fast..........</li>
            <li> These toothbrush heads are expensive but they are definitely worth it! After brushing, my teeth feel exceptionally clean and I could never go back to a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have used sonicare toothbrushes on the advice of my periodontist, the electric toothbrush makes it easy to brush all areas, however, the brush heads are not heavy duty like my old manual toothbrush, they require periodic replacement, a bit expensive at around $10 a pop.  I can really tell the difference between an old head and a new one.  Still, when compared to what my periodontist charges for a visit, this is a small price to pay, since the sonicare has virtually eliminated most of the \\&quot;pockets\\&quot; around my gumline.  I also recommend flushing with a dental irrigator aka Waterpick after brushing, it is very effective and I use one instead of flossing, works just as well apparently.</li>
            <li> other brands don&#x27;t hold up. i&#x27;ve tried other replacement heads and believe this one is best...unless i just bought a crappy set of off-brands?? I&#x27;ll continue paying extra for something i know works.</li>
            <li> My Sonicare toothbrush was stolen out of my luggage on an airline flight recently and I&#x27;ve ordered another. No matter how many times I brush with a manual brush, I cannot achieve the clean feeling I get after using a Sonicare. They are over-priced IMO, but some things are worth splurging on.</li>
            <li> the brush head is not good price for Philips.</li>
            <li> They work fine but are way too expensive for what you get which is why I&#x27;m giving them 3 stars. Elsewhere on this site you can 6 heads for almost half the price.</li>
            <li> Great replacements to my original brush. They seem firm and deliver the cleaning power to my teeth, gums, and tongue.</li>
            <li> These brush heads work well and are more reasonably priced than in our local stores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame these say they are from Philips because they obviously are fakes. The first two brushes wore out within a week and had errant bristles falling off. Neither fit my Sonicare well either. The third one completely well off every time I turned my toothbrush on. Total waste of money - DO NOT BUY. Purchase a 6 pack from Costco for ~ $40.00 instead. Much better quality and worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Philips Sonicare brush since 3 years now. Love it, no complains.</li>
            <li> Will never go back to a traditional toothbrush. These brush heads are wonderful and last longer than three months.</li>
            <li> can never have enough!</li>
            <li> They fit perfectly on our Sonicare Whitening brushes so A+ from us! Seem to last 4-6 months depending on how clean you like your mouth.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than buying in store!  The only complaint is there&#x27;s not 4 of them.  I buy these for me and my wife.  So only one of us gets the 3rd new one.  We usually arm wrestle for it and i win by sucker punching her in the boob.&lt;br /&gt;Save some money and buy these.</li>
            <li> We needed replacement heads for this toothbrush and found the best prices here. The product was just as described and I would purchase again. The product shipped quickly. I would recommend this product for the quality, price and prompt shipping.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect such a good quality I&#x27;m very pleased and I&#x27;ll buy from here only</li>
            <li> UNFORTUNATLY, THEY DON&#x27;T LAST TOO LONG, BUT THEY WORK AT REMOVING PLAQUE.  i WISH THEY WEREN&#x27;T SO EXPENSIVE, BUT WHAT PRICE CAN YOU PLACE ON DENTAL HEALTH</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying brush replacements for the ProResults Sonicare model and have never had one wear out so quickly. In less than a month it looked like 6+ months. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> These were of the worst quality.  I would believe that they were counterfeit.  I&#x27;ve been using a Phillips Sonicare for over 2 years and have gone through many brush head replacements.  These brush heads lasted at most 2 weeks. The bristles instantly began to flay out and flatten.  Genuine brush heads usually last in excess of their three month lifespan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to request a refund for this merchandise.  I hope that others with the same experience will also rate this vendor to bring down their over inflated rating.</li>
            <li> it was too weak only 3 times brush start to splits so I don&#x27;t buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what else to type to tell how bad was...</li>
            <li> Great item. Quick shipping. A++++++</li>
            <li> I ordered this to replace my aging brush heads and they arrived in perfect condition.  I would highly recommend this to any of my friends.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find these any cheaper in the stores, excellent product at a great value.  Why would anyone shop anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Exactly as stated, they are exactly as they appear in the ad and to the one in the grocery store.  Do not be afraid to purchase these - they are the exact same as the one that came in yourf Philips Sonicare when you first purchased it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like the one that came with your sonicare. If you expect it to do anything more special, it wont.</li>
            <li> these heads are very durable.  they are soft as not to irritate your gums and they last a long time.  ive been using the first one now still for months already.</li>
            <li> I should have know that these brush heads were too good to be true considering their price.  They have not lasted nearly as well as others I have bought for the Sonicare.  The quality was poor and they lasted about 3 weeks when they are suppose to last 3 months.</li>
            <li> Product was of the quality I expected.</li>
            <li> These are good brushes. The last ones I got wore out very fast, they may have been a knockoff. If you need brushes, get these ones!</li>
            <li> great item, pleased with seller and with the product</li>
            <li> These are great for my Sonicare Toothbrush.  They fit which was my biggest concern.  I ordered my Sonicare through my doctors office when I worked there as a dental assistant.  I had no idea where to get the replacement brushes.  Here they are!</li>
            <li> Does a great job. One of the better prices around.</li>
            <li> Its amazing how much better your sonic brushing is with a new head... these work just fine!</li>
            <li> These must have been counterfeit. They not only didn&#x27;t fit properly on the device but they literally fell apart. I had to throw them out.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and I am fairly certain that it is a fake. The brush head has faded print on it saying &amp;#34;ProResults&amp;#34; and the base of it, when I set it down on a counter without the base of the brush, is crooked. I went and bought a 5-pack replacement set from a local store, and the difference is clear: the ones that I ordered from Amazon just can&#x27;t be the real deal.</li>
            <li> There is no way that these brushes cost even 5% of the price charged to make, but like razor blades, the company could give away the handle for free and make a fortune selling just the brushes.  I started using an automatic tooth brush at the recommendation of my dentist who believed my gum recession was due to a history of poor brushing technique and inadequate flossing.  Since I started using this brush the problem is completely reversed.  But here&#x27;s a tip --- the brushes never truly wear out, they just become misshapen.  Don&#x27;t replace them every 3 or 6 months --- use them for a year or more, they work just fine even after that long --- and my dentist can back me up.</li>
            <li> This is horrible.  Not worth the price I paid whatsoever.  I bought these brush heads a year ago, and the difference between then and now is huge.  They shorten the bristles that makes it more difficult to brush my teeth, but they say &amp;#34;contoured pattern fits the natural shape of your teeth&amp;#34;.  So the previous brushes didn&#x27;t feel the natural shape of my teeth?? Did they just decide to screw me over a year ago so they could come up with something better now?  My theory is that they shorten the bristles to save money on material, and the prices for these brush head still went up!  Not only that, where the previous brush heads did last 3 months, these would go bad after a day.  The second brush I used from this pack of 3 lasts about 2 weeks.  This third one won&#x27;t last long either I imagine.  Amazon needs to pull this product off the shelf!</li>
            <li> Great product and consistent quality.</li>
            <li> All that it  was advertised to be and arrived when expected.</li>
            <li> Bristles seem to soft and inconsistent to be authentic. Buy from Amazon only to avoid knock offs.</li>
            <li> i ate oreo cookies and took the brush test and it took forever to get the cookie out of my natural dips in my back teeth. The effectiveness of these replacement heads are about as same as a toothbrush from the dollar tree!</li>
            <li> The Sonicare tooth brush is a tremendous asset because these brushes clean so well and leave your mouth feeling great.  The replacements are a little pricey, but what did you expect when you bought the toothbrush itself?  A little shopping around located this replacement pack, which was delivered a day later than expected.</li>
            <li> Great factory branded brushes.  They work as well as the ones at walmart/bestbuy etc.  they cost less on here and work great!</li>
            <li> Love these. It is a great deal for the set of three. You would pay so much more if you purchased them at a retail store.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the product and price.</li>
            <li> The brush heads I received were obviously counterfeit and not authentic Philips products.  Although the packaging was very convincing and official looking and actually said &amp;#34;Philips&amp;#34;, the performance of the brush heads was nowhere near the stock heads that came with the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The bristles were extremely soft and ineffective&lt;br /&gt;- After a week of use the bristles were completely bent over and useless&lt;br /&gt;- Inside the shaft they were missing the bump that snaps them in place on the toothbrush so the brush heads would fall off easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shame on Amazon for listing &amp;#34;Philips&amp;#34; below the product name because they are definitely not authentic Philips products but rather counterfeit lookalikes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with other fakes manufactured in questionable countries who knows what else may be wrong with these brush heads.....toxic paint, lead, etc...  For something that I am going to put in my mouth twice a day I&#x27;m not going to take that risk.  Unfortunately from now on I will inconveniently only purchase my replacement brush heads from a brick and mortar store that also sells the Philips tooth brushes so I know they will be authentic Philips brand brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips has created a perfect scenario for counterfeiters by charging such extremely high prices for a product that is extremely cheap to manufacture.  This is similar to other highly counterfeited products such as expensive hand bags and expensive sun glasses.  These brush heads can probably be manufactured for less than $0.20 each and are sold for $8.00 each.  It&#x27;s a counterfeiters dream scenario with a 4000% markup.</li>
            <li> Love the electric toothbrush. Sonicare is as good as it gets. When Philips joined with (or bought?) Sonicare, quality went downhill. The brush heads became smaller, therefore less tooth surface is getting cleaned at a moment, and the bristles wear out more quickly. I still change only after three months, which is how long they are supposed to last. If I changed more often than that, I&#x27;d just be providing a larger profit for Philips Sonicare. I revert to my manual toothbrush when the bristles go too soft.</li>
            <li> This is the replacement brush head to use with the [[ASIN:B000UK2W4C Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush with Sanitizer]].  It&#x27;s a snap to use (literally):  Just pull off the old brush and push on the new one until it snaps and you&#x27;re ready to enjoy your FlexCare.  Phillips recommends a new brush head every three months.  You&#x27;ll know it&#x27;s time to replace the brush when the old bristles start to spread out, but just to be sure, the replacements come with handy little month stickers that you can put on your charger base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The FlexCare is a great toothbrush, and these replacement brushes will keep you and your dentist happy for nine months.  At less than ten dollars each, they are well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This multi-pack of brush heads are excatly what you need to have. They will give you the brushes you need to change every 3 to 4 months. They work great and fit the handle like a glove.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take long at all, been looking all over for this product and I finally found it on Amazon.   It was cheaper then all other competitors.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Or rather, if everybody starts using these, dentists all over will go bankrupt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are my favorite brush heads for the Sonicare line of toothbrushes. I&#x27;ve owned several over the years and tried almost all head options.&lt;br /&gt;The HX6013 last long (3 month lifespan is the manufacturer recommendation, but they can easily last 5-6 months if treated properly), they fit with a (literal) snap of your fingers and do the best job of all the competitors I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a person with a long history of cavities and tooth/gum issues, I can proudly say since I started using these I saw a dramatic decline in cavities and plaque.&lt;br /&gt;I even keep a spare 3-pack at home and whenever the subject of toothbrushes comes up (rare, but it happens) in a conversation, I force some of my friends to try a new one out, and at least 5-6 of them converted to the Sonicare after a single use. I let them keep the head :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you found this helpful!</li>
            <li> I stopped using my Sonicare shortly after these arrived.  These heads seemed a lot softer then the original head my Sonicare came with, and I eventually realized that the Sonicare wasn&#x27;t so great anyway, I couldn&#x27;t get between my teeth with it.  Since stopping, I went back to my Oral B, it&#x27;s faster, more efficient, gets everywhere it should, and my teeth feel a lot cleaner.  My dentist advised me to go back to the Sonicare.  No way.  It just doesn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li> I used to buy refills at bed bath and beyond, it was like $50-60 for 3. You could by the off brand replacements at Smiths and it was $35. These are the same thing as the OEM, and a fraction of the cost. Cheapest replacements you can find!</li>
            <li> These go with a variety of Sonicare brushes and seem to last longer than the package says.  changing to the new ones makes a big difference when you use one too long.</li>
            <li> The shipment was received on time and the 3-Pack cost much less than a local purchase. I immediately opened the package, removed the old brush head and installed one of the new ones.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are great in quality, but unfortunately they didn&#x27;t fit perfectly in my Sonic base.  I&#x27;m still able to use them though.</li>
            <li> These frayed in 4 weeks for both my husband and me. We had to replace two of these within a month. Are these knock offs? This never happened to me until I ordered here. Next time I&#x27;m buying them from that store.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and everything expected when I bought this product! Especially good to replaces every month if you have braces like me. Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> These work just fine if they fit.  Being the Sonicare brand I expected no problems, but one of the heads wouldn&#x27;t stay clicked on the brush base and fell off when it started vibrating.</li>
            <li> Well made. Easy to replace. Has a wear indicator to change to a new brush head. Recommended brand - Philips Sonicare.</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED.  Had no other choice but to use this inferior knock off.  I could have gone to &amp;#34;the Walmart&amp;#34; and purchased something less expensive.</li>
            <li> These are defective or fake toothbrush heads. They don&#x27;t snap onto my Sonicare toothbrush and the bristles are weak and spread out.  What a waste of money.......</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to see that these refills appear to be OEM and at a fraction of the cost compared to Wal-mart and other retail stores!</li>
            <li> I did some real searching for saving on purchasing my brush heads and certainly made a good find with this purchase.  Item came exactly as described, brand new, brand name brush heads, and at a much cheaper price than I could find in any nearby stores.</li>
            <li> I have serious doubts about authenticity of this product. I purchased these for my EasyClean Sonicare toothbrush which I have had for over a year. I always bought new brush heads on amazon, because they are cheaper than in a drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These head brushes kept sliding off when in use. At first I thought that I broke my toothbrush, but then I noticed that the attachment part of these heads is a little bit different than my previous ones- there is a little bump that is not on the original ones. (I put my old brush head on, and it worked perfectly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought maybe this is a newer version of heads or something, but I bought new heads from Duane Reade again, and they work perfectly.</li>
            <li> These brushheads did not properly fit my Sonic Toothbrush. Yes, they were the right ones. One broke in half immediately and they others were hard to put on. I should have returned them but ran out to Harmon, bought them again and they fit fine. Buyer Beware!!!</li>
            <li> Brand name is the way to go !  When you&#x27;ve purchased the best - you should buy the original replacements to go with it instead of generics (I tried them and it wasn&#x27;t worth it).  Stay with the brand name.</li>
            <li> I love these. It is about the best price that I&#x27;ve been able to find for it and they are perfect for my toothbrush. This is the second order I&#x27;ve purchased of these. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> These heads rattle on the toothbrush more than the $16 knockoffs I bought on Groupon. Either they changed the design, or the quality just went down for the pack of three, but go buy the two pack.....</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted.  Top notch heads, cheaper then anywhere else, and you own the Philips Sonicare system already.</li>
            <li> was what I needed. does what I want. I do not have much more to say about it than that.</li>
            <li> Great heads for a wonderful toothbrush!  I&#x27;ve only had a sonicare for about 6 months, and I have no idea why I waited so long to buy one.  It&#x27;s amazing, I can&#x27;t believe how clean my mouth and teeth feel all the time!</li>
            <li> I have been using a Sonicare Flexcare system for 4 years now and have gone through about 16 brush heads.  Each brush head in the past that I have purchased has lasted for the recommended 3 month change period without any issues.  But, with the brush heads I purchased from the seller &amp;#34;GOODTIMETOBY&amp;#34;, I noticed when I put the brush head on, it didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;lock&amp;#34; into place like all the prior ones had.  And, after using it for the first time, the bristles looked rather frayed...  Just 5 days later, I had to change the brush head because the bristles became VERY frayed.  They were so frayed the whole brush head was compacted down and looked almost melted.  So, I tried the second brush head in the pack and it did the exact same thing.  In fact, on the second brush head, the metal ring fell off after a couple days use.  These are OBVIOUSLY counterfeit items.  The performance is abysmal compared to the prior brushes I have purchased  And, the worst part is that I purchased 2 packs of these at once, so I am now out $36.50!  Do not buy from the seller &amp;#34;GOODTIMETOBY&amp;#34;....  Guess I should have paid more attention to the seller&#x27;s name as they can&#x27;t even spell &amp;#34;BUY&amp;#34; correctly!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my automatic shipping of the Sonicare brush heads for our toothbrushes. It is so easy to forget to replace them as often as one should. This is a constant reminder. I replace the brushes the day the package arrives. As a result, we are maximinizing the benefit of our electronic products. I have to admit, I am not as good remembering to replace at the right time inbetween the shipments.</li>
            <li> Works well and fits my toothbrush and it looks good and cleans good and all that stuff that you want.</li>
            <li> Sadly, the first brush head I used failed to pass the test. I ended up with plastic brush pieces in my mouth. Others have had this experience as well. A family member works for Phillips so we&#x27;ve used this product for years. This is the first time I&#x27;ve had this happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11/9/13.  The replacement head has turned out to be satisfactory. I&#x27;ve not experienced any more brush pieces lodged in my mouth. I would order these again.</li>
            <li> Fit my Sonicare toothbrush perfectly! I thought this would be a long shot in getting it to fit my toothbrush, but luckily they fir perfectly</li>
            <li> There is not much for me to say about this product, but I needed toothbrush heads to brush my teeth. So they work, they were new, and I was satisfied.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this purchase.  The brushes are good, just a wee bit soft for my taste, but are adequate.  The price is quite good for the true Philips brand.  I&#x27;ve tried the off brands and they simply are not the same quality so not worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t seem as sturdy as the head that came with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is clearly a FAKE product... Even the printing looks cheap compared to genuine Philips Sonicare brushes. The main problem is that the brush does not fit properly on the Sonicare handle and, as others noticed, comes off while in motion. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> These work well with my toothbrush. The bristles are firmly packed, but soft. I like that each one comes with a cover.</li>
            <li> They where what I expected</li>
            <li> I was happy in receiving these on a time to have extra heads.&lt;br /&gt;What I like the best was they come in a little cover for the heads</li>
            <li> After researching with several local dentists we purchased our second family of Sonicare brushes. The Sonicare Pro offered all the modes we wanted particulary the massage. These replacement brushes were less expensive than the same ones Sonicare offered with a discount.</li>
            <li> Worked one day, wouldn&#x27;t stay on shaft, material, design or manufacturer defect? Who knows, all I know is it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Love it, does the job right. You can see the difference in a very short time. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love these brush heads Always ordering more since I can&#x27;t get enough of them and need extras for traveling and stuff.</li>
            <li> The brush heads work well but the little rings that come with the heads don&#x27;t fit well, but don&#x27;t affect the function, just looks like it&#x27;s the wrong part since it doesn&#x27;t fit well.</li>
            <li> Sonicare brushheads are great. They clean your teeth and make you feel as if you had just been to the dentist for a cleaning.</li>
            <li> This is the best deal I have found for these replacement heads and I absolutely LOVE the Phillips Sonicare system!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> These are standard Philips Sonicare heads. I love my sonicare toothbrush and this alows me to purchase replacement heads much cheaper than local department stores offer. I just don&#x27;t understand why they are so expensive to begin with.</li>
            <li> Great! No issues here. Work well and fit our electric brush nicely. Some reviewers here suggested that these are knock offs but I do not think so.</li>
            <li> Excellent supplier. Just as promised and timely. Thank you, kindly.</li>
            <li> I have used one of the brush heads for 6 days.  They are horrible.  The cap does not fit.  It pulls the brush head apart.  The bristles are so soft, they feel like they are over 3 months old already. The brush head does not fit on the base properly.  I will never buy these from here again.  I have used a Sonicare toothbrush for about 12 years now and have never had this issue with the brush heads before.  I have bought them from many different places.  I even used some &amp;#34;compatible&amp;#34; ones from Groupon and they are even better than these.</li>
            <li> These fit the Philips Sonicare HX6733/80 HealthyWhite 3 Mode Premium Edition Rechargeable that I bought. Love both very much. So much better than the E series ones with that cap like brushes that get moldy underneath. No problems with this toothbrush or replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Easy on and easy off. Just like the original one that came on the brush. 3 pack makes it easy to keep up with having a fresh brush.</li>
            <li> These did not fit my toothbrush trying to use the one I opened but the stem is not covered on my toothbrush So had to order from the manufacture</li>
            <li> They work. What else is there to say.</li>
            <li> Not much to report other than these are great! As soon as I replaced the old head, my mouth/teeth felt 100% &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; again with this toothbrush. Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as everyone else says.... just with they were cheaper!</li>
            <li> Decent price but comes closed to a sale price at the local Walgreens. I always tend to go local when I can.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t exactly need 3 of these at once, but it&#x27;s the best option. Perfect replacement for my Sonicare. They work as expected. No major issues yet.</li>
            <li> Purchased for use with a Sonicare brush. These are OEM replacements so work just fine. Would recommend to others and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> We love our Sonicare tooth brush products.  These brushes were a great deal and worked flawlessly.  This order shipped quickly, the products were packaged wonderfully, thus making the entire experience fabulous.</li>
            <li> Based on Amazon reviews I bought these brush heads at the same time I bought the Sonicare HX6711/02.  I am unhappy that the brush heads are so small, but I am even more unhappy that I wind up with one or more bristles left in my mouth after almost every brushing.  I have only been using the product a little over a month, and there has been no color change in the bristles, so it isn&#x27;t that the brush head is worn out.  The tiny size of the brush head makes it feel like I need to spend longer brushing my teeth than should be necessary.&lt;br /&gt;August 3, 2012  I contacted Phillips, and they are going to send me another box of brush heads.  I did discover that the blue color had completely faded on both brushes I had used in less than a month each.</li>
            <li> Great product, use them for past 2 years and see considerable improvement in my oral health. Cheaper replacement than Costco or Sams</li>
            <li> Glad there is a replacement for my electric toothbrush since I paid so much money for it.  The replacements come in a package of three so you always have a spare.  The electric toothbrush does a much better job on my teeth than manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed that one brush was a tiny child&#x27;s brush - so small I threw it out.  Also had a hard time fitting this on to my Pro, but extra force did it and worked OK.  That is, the two usuable ones.</li>
            <li> This is a great price for these replacement heads and the quality is just the same as the ones that came with my Phillips Toothbrush. You pay alot more for the same product at CVS, Rite Aid or even Target or Walmart. Amazon will be the only place I continue to buy these replacement heads !!</li>
            <li> I hv been using the smaller sonicare heads and I don&#x27;t care for them as much as these. I loved these larger heads and the price beat those of the large chain stores! I def recommend!</li>
            <li> still too expensive. but i like using the sonicare better than manual brush.</li>
            <li> Work just as expected.</li>
            <li> Bought these because of the price. These are authentic Philips brush heads and they come with several color rings to label users. Great deal, i&#x27;ll buy them from here again.</li>
            <li> These brushes need a QC (quality control) test. The handle of my unit vibrates, however the brush doesn&#x27;t!  I will be calling Sonicare. I have been using my Oral B instead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Philips Sonicare ProResults system for a few years now. I love the level of cleaning I get when I brush with this toothbrush. These brush heads are critical to getting the results you are looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problem with these heads is that they are generally expensive. However, with subscribe and save, you get the best price going. Also, with subscribe and save the packaging is far easier to open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s mileage will vary with these heads, but I generally get 2-3 months out of one before I have to replace it. It really just depends. The don&#x27;t feel cheap and tend to hold up well. Overall, I would recommend.</li>
            <li> What else would one order for a Sonicare toothbrush?  They hold up well, and are a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Sonicare ProResults toothbrush for about two years now. Every time I go into the dentist, she tells me how great my teeth and gums look. Every. Time. And the toothbrush itself is very high quality. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with function. The toothbrush heads get a bit pricey, especially since my husband and I both use them and they really do need to be replaced every three months (instead of every six, like conventional toothbrushes). However, I try to frame the cost in terms of the savings I accrue by taking such good care of my teeth. I&#x27;d rather spend money on toothbrushes than fillings or other expensive dental work. The toothbrush and the replacement heads are definitely worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I feel like this is a very good product.  And they were at a good price.  I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY! KNOCK OFFS!&lt;br /&gt;Quality with amazon products is a luck of the draw AMAZON please do something to qualify your vendors!&lt;br /&gt;All packaging looks like original- but brush head vibrates off and bristles are softer and poorly cut. I cannot see phillips putting such a defective lot on the market, they must be knock offs.</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare ProResults toothbrush has helped to reduce plaque and has halted my gum disease substantially.  Unfortunately, the brush heads are expensive when purchased through local retailers.  This supplier offered an excellent price for this excellent product.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Not aftermarket like some were when I was searching for them.</li>
            <li> Works as described at a fraction of the cost</li>
            <li> I have had no problem with these, but I think the price is too high because they don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> These are factory sonicare brushes, so expect the same quality as you got with your original brush that came with the sonicare unit.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare! However, if I replaced brush heads as directed, I would have to buy a new 3-Pack every 3 months! They wear out WAY TOO QUICKLY! After 2 months, the brush doesn&#x27;t clean very well so I am going through a 3-Pack every 6 months. It&#x27;s unfortunate for me because I will do what it take to use the toothbrush! Thanks!</li>
            <li> It fit my sonicare toothbrush perfectly at a much lower cost.,will definitely buy more..delivery was fast . can&#x27;t think of anything else.</li>
            <li> Not sure if amazon used a different supplier for my order, but I received a cheap knock-off that didn&#x27;t last for more than 1 day. Needless to say ended up returning it.</li>
            <li> I ordered these and in less than a week the bristels were falling out and the brush head looked like it had been used for years. It didn&#x27;t maintain its shape at all. I&#x27;ve used this toothbrush for years and not had this problem before. I&#x27;m going to get mine at Costco now. I&#x27;m returning these to the seller.</li>
            <li> I made sure these were the proper head replacements for my toothbrush.  They fit going on, but as soon as I turn my toothbrush on and start brushing they slide right off!</li>
            <li> I like the toothbrush but the price of the heads is high.  Have to say that they have made it easy to order online though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Sonicare for many years but this is a new model.  I&#x27;ve always ordered replacement heads thru Amazon, most of the time in the bulk package to save a little.  These were what I needed at a good price.</li>
            <li> They were really cheaply made! They come apart all the time.  I&#x27;ve purchased these in the past &amp; they were great! I was really disappointed!!</li>
            <li> Perhaps this was just a bad batch but none of the three that came in the package have stayed on the brush for long. To the vendor&#x27;s credit they did contact me soon after the order was received asking to be allowed to fix any concerns. I shared with them that the first brush had failed but that the second seemed to be working. I have searched my email but there does not appear to be a reply from them regarding the faulty first brush. In fairness, they probably receive hundreds if not thousands of emails. In any case, while the second brush did last a couple weeks or so, it too, failed, as did the third one, almost immediately. None of these brushes would stay on the handle. Again, it is probably just a bad batch but I will probably try to find another vendor for the next order. I should say the brushes themselves were fine, otherwise. If they had stayed on I would have given them a 4 or 5.</li>
            <li> this is a knock off.  the bristles won&#x27;t last a week.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure this is not the genuine replace heads from Philips. Doesn&#x27;t fit very well with my Sonicare tooth brush, brush went soft and dis formed after a couple weeks of use. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> Shame on you seller!! you sold a FAKE product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The bristles were extremely soft and in a month they are not straight anymore.&lt;br /&gt;- The brush is not holding the brush head after couple of weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is complete waste of money. DO NOT buy this item.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THESE ARE FAKE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I purchased these toothbrush heads thinking that they were legit only to find out that they are cheap FAKES and do not work. I bought real Sonicare tooth brush heads to compare to these fakes and they are completely different. The real ones have serial numbers and the ProResults lettering looks different not to mention that the bristles are also long and seem to be cut terribly on these fakes. The seller accepted my return request, but to send back it&#x27;s another fee for return shipping on top of the initial cost for shipping in the first place. So basically even if you do decide to return these fake tooth brush heads you will be losing money on shipping. I am a regular customer on Amazon and I feel so violated that Amazon has not banned this product considering there are other reviews claiming that this product is fake. I usually don&#x27;t ever write reviews but I had to on this one. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!</li>
            <li> Not sure if i&#x27;m just using the heads wrong but the replacement heads came with the little colored rings too to go between the base and the head.  For my original head i had the plastic ring in place and it was fine, but i noticed with the replacement heads if I use the plastic rings, the head actually eventually comes loose and actually come OFF of the base while i&#x27;m brushing! D:  problem was solved once i just got rid of the plastic ring tho and placed the head directly on the base.  What&#x27;s the point of those plastic rings?  Prevents rubbing/damage of the base?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, this a standard pack of 3.  it works like I expected it, but i didn&#x27;t really notice it being dramatically more clean or whatever.  It&#x27;s just good lol.</li>
            <li> Looks like someone is following the Gillette business model.  These work great and last a long time but are way overprice for what they are.</li>
            <li> the philips sonicare tooth  system is great&lt;br /&gt;bought these replacement heads on amazon at a fraction of the cost my store was selling them for</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy that I got a good price on a 3-pack of replacement brushes for my sonic toothbrush.  At the store, they are much more expensive!</li>
            <li> Love my sonicare toothbrush needed more heads and will be buying more when it is time to refill, every time.</li>
            <li> One of the brush heads didn&#x27;t fit the unit.  I also had this happen last time I bought a 3-pack.  Seems like a lot of money for only two usable brush heads.</li>
            <li> These brushes are perfect. Great for the price and fits the toothbrush perfectly.  I love this brand and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re tooth brushes, what more van I say.</li>
            <li> They fit my handle. Good quality.  Price keeps going up a few bucks each year.</li>
            <li> cheaper then going to the store and buying them so if you plan ahead you save money and a trip</li>
            <li> Fit my sonicare just as stated. Not much to it. They are the typical sonicare heads. Came quickly.</li>
            <li> Great tooth brush. Very happy with it. Price on here is the same as in stores (when we purchased anyways).</li>
            <li> Everything works as intended. My teeth are shiny clean. Love Sonicare products. Would not use a regular toothbrush again. Thanks.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY!!!...These Philips Sonicare hx6013 brush heads are terrible... There are so hard they are killing my gums!! Spend the extra and go with the diamond head!! Not sure I can return them but will be writing Sonicare.. It&#x27;s crazy how expensive the toothbrush was to begin with and then the price of brush heads are also ridicules!!!</li>
            <li> what can you say it replacement brushes for your tooth brush if you have one you have to change them</li>
            <li> The Phillips sonicare brushes are good in quality and does its job (cleaning) great. I like the size of the brush heads as it is small enough to maneuver around the hard to reach places (back teeth). Minus one star as it is a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace the brush head on the Sonicare Flexcare toothbrush I have. Supposively, you are to replace the brush head every 3 months for best effectiveness.  These also come with a wear indicator too.  For the price for 3 of them, to me, it&#x27;s worth it.  Just make sure you buy the correct replacement heads as there are a lot out there for the various Sonic toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> At Amazons price three brishheads seemed like a good deal.  But since they actually shipped only two brushheads, the real per unit cost was much higher at Amazon.  This is the second time I&#x27;m submitting this review -- Amazon rejected the first one even though it met all of their guidelines.  Now I see that there is a banner ad at the top of my Amazon page at the moment -- paid for by Sonicare.  Now I&#x27;m wondering if the reviews are valid -- perhaps they scan and reject the ones that don&#x27;t meet their sales and marketting goals.  At any rate, buyer beware.</li>
            <li> Las cabezas del cepillo me llegaron empacadas y en excelente estado, y las he usado en mi cepillo phillips sin ningun problema</li>
            <li> qqqqqq w  e  r  r t y u iiii  hhhhhhhhhhh  jjj  jjjj jjjjjjjjjjj jyyyyyyyyyyyyyy ggggg o p  a aaaaaaaaaa s  dssdd  fffffffffg g vvvvv rrrrrrrrrrrrr e  eeeeeeeeeee e  dddddddddddddddd rrr bbbbbbbbbbbbb uuuuuuuuuu sssssssssssfffffffffff fffffffffff ffffffffffff rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr ty  bbb</li>
            <li> The items certainly looked like they were a Phillips product, but once I opened the package and started to use it - FAKE!  The brush head didn&#x27;t fit well, the brush head cover didn&#x27;t fit, and after two uses, the brush head looked worse than brush heads I&#x27;ve used for months!  When I compare them to other Phillips brush heads, there are slight differences in the name printed on the brush heads.  I already tossed the packaging so I&#x27;m stuck with unusable brush heads.  Beware.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads were worthless and have flattened out in less than a week so that they are no longer useable. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Needed a new brush head and this was affordable and worth it. I recommend this product. It was a good buy</li>
            <li> These are fake brush heads that fray after 2-3 uses. They are absolutely worthless; do NOT buy. The real ones maintain their structural integrity for months.</li>
            <li> I have used them for many years! I first liked the \\&quot;Compact Head\\&quot; model, but now I prefer this \\&quot;Full Head\\&quot; size and the contoured bristles. My hygienist also likes how much better my teeth are, during cleaning appointments,&lt;br /&gt; now that I use the Sonicare toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Sonic brushes work great.Clean just like they are supposed too.  Great for getting that gum line.  Good gum massage as well.</li>
            <li> The sonicare toothbrush has been a wonderful way to help protect against expensive, and painful dental procedures. I have owned a sonicare toothbrush for the last 10 years, having recently bought the flexcare, since my old sonicare was plugged into 220, and died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is awesome, and my cleanings that I get done at regular intervals, every 6 months, go with little problems because of this brush. I do no floss as much as I should, so this goes a long way in helping to mitigate the effects of neglect. I floss generally 3 times a week, instead of nightly.....laziness on my part. Anyway, I am over 40, and still have all 32 original teeth, no crowns, bridges, root canals, or even a single pulled tooth. Pretty rare for someone my age, and I believe that a lot of that has to do with this brush system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While these brush heads are not terribly expensive, they are certainly more than a regular manual brush. And since they are not available in the Philippines, which is my home now, I hoped that I would get a few months use out of them, but they appear to degrade, both visibly, and in the fresh feeling you get after a brushing, in about a month. So I will have to order a much larger supply of them, my next round of purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recall my older model, the brush heads seemed to last a lot longer, I know that you are supposed to change heads regularly, but as long as they are still effective, I continue to use them, just seem to be going through these newer models, much faster than the older ones. Could be the brush I have, has many cycles, and I brush longer than 2 minutes now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 4 star rating is based on the short life of the head, but they do a fantastic job of cleaning when they are in proper working condition, and there is no better feeling on your teeth, unless you are just walking out of the dentists office, for me, there is no  other brand.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy these if you want them to last. I bought them because they were cheaper then the ones I was buying in the store but now I understand why. I&#x27;ve been using 1 for about a week and a half, twice a day and the bristles are already falling to the side. Quality of these brush heads are subpar.</li>
            <li> Excellent - Item delivered on time, was as described, great customer service</li>
            <li> I ordered three packages of these, and I think I paid $25 each. The first one I took out of the package kept popping off the end of my toothbrush. Every time I used it. It was very annoying. I finally threw that one away and used the next one in the package to see if it continued to happen. Luckily, the second head is not slipping off the shank. I&#x27;ll be very disappointed if a number of these are defective like the first one!</li>
            <li> good replacement heads, no problems.</li>
            <li> Heads for Healthy White Toothbrush. This toothbrush is great because you can recharge it using any current. Great for travel outside the US. Heads just snap on and are easy to change.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare toothbrushes for over 20 years.  The replacement brush heads seem to be getting inferior in quality and cleaning ability.  This latest order is further proof.  I may consider looking at other brands, which is sad after 20+ years of loyalty.</li>
            <li> Thsee are fake. Bristles bend over and bend after less than one week. Additionally the brand is not philips.</li>
            <li> They are just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Review aint needed for these. If you havent tried Phillips sonicare products, then do. Nothing is better. expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> The ones I received were 100% counterfeit and fell apart after one week. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> These brush heads fit our Sonicare toothbrushes perfectly and work great.  We received them quickly and were happy with the service.</li>
            <li> These are copies of the OEM and it&#x27;s easy to tell. Thickness of the &amp;#34;neck&amp;#34; is wrong, font is wrong size and pixelated where it says &amp;#34;ProResults&amp;#34;. They don&#x27;t click into place like the originals so the little covers can&#x27;t be used because you pull the head off every time. They are usable so I gave 2 stars, just surprised these came from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Do your teeth and gums a favor with floss, soft picks, and Sonicare brushes. I just ordered these after the original brush lasted me two years. I could have used them much longer. The key is not pressing too hard on the teeth.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, excellent product!</li>
            <li> if you haven&#x27;t switched to a sonic toothbrush, what are you waiting for?  So easy, it&#x27;s a pleasure to brush.</li>
            <li> Love the sonic care, but when mine broke down after just one year, I had to re place it ASAP.  These heads fit the easy clean sonic care.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare toothbrush for over 10 years.  This is exactly what we were looking for.  It is also much cheaper then the other stores that were selling it.  These brushes exactly fit the brush that I have.</li>
            <li> Been using these for years and it paid off.  I finally went to the dentist after 10 years of having not been.  I just knew I had cavities.  Not one cavity!  I attribute this to having using the Sonicare system and these brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember using these for the first time.  I just couldn&#x27;t quit running my tongue over my teeth, it was like I&#x27;d been to the dentist for a cleaning.  I have read where these don&#x27;t do any better job than an regular toothbrush.  I have to disagree.  After using these once you&#x27;ll be a believer.</li>
            <li> After only 2 weeks&#x27; use, these brush heads literally mashed down, were so worn they were not worth using for brushing teeth.  These are nothing like the Sonicare heads I have ordered from Amazon in the past, and I agree with other reviewers who state it seems they are a cheap knock-off of the real Philips replacement brush heads. I went to Target and bought a package there, and they are wearing just as they should, not like the ones from Amazon.  I am so disappointed...and a little concerned over what the brush heads that mashed down were made out of.  What did I swallow?  I would not recommend these as they are a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I also think these toothbrush heads are counterfeit.  The bristles started breaking down after only 1 week.  Previous ProResults toothbrush heads that I had bought lasted more than 3 months.  I also started noticing gum recession and I worry that it was the fake toothbrush heads that were wearing my gums down. Have now switched to &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; heads.  I would spend the extra money to make sure you&#x27;re getting an authentic product and don&#x27;t damage your gums!</li>
            <li> Works the same as the name brand heads.</li>
            <li> This replacement head works just the way it should, but it&#x27;s sure not cheap.  Not Amazon&#x27;s fault, since their price was the lowest I could find on the &#x27;net.  It is the right head, though, and it came packaged well.  Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> The compact brush heads were a necessary resupply for the Sonicare toothbrush. This was the most convenient and cheapest method of purchase.</li>
            <li> I got just what I was looking for--my type of sonicare heads and at a cheaper price than what I could find in stores. The description fit just what I got.</li>
            <li> Best price I can find - but I still resent how much the replacement heads cost.  It makes me use them far longer than I probably should</li>
            <li> These replacement brushes are exact replacements for the Phillips Sonicare HX6013 electric toothbrush.  They work fine and hold up to three months with twice daily use.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are great! They fit my Philips Sonicare ProResults tooth brush just right. I would definitely buy these again.</li>
            <li> And were difficult to find locally.  Thank you Amazon for carrying these even though my Sonicare is a few years old.  It still works great and the replacement heads are color coded.</li>
            <li> Great price for the amount of replacement heads.</li>
            <li> exactly what i needed.</li>
            <li> Charged me $29.38 for a 26.95 purchase. They provide no phone number to dispute. Disputing charge on credit card is a long process  for a $2.43 price difference.</li>
            <li> Brush head keeps slipping off. Bristles poor.</li>
            <li> These are very good replacement brushes for the Philips Sonicare Flex toothbrush!...  They fit the brush perfectly, unlike many of the &#x27;knock-off&#x27; brands available !....</li>
            <li> Fits our FlexCare model perfectly. Much better cleaning than a manual toothbrush and it does not wear out as fast. All my research shows, too, that Sonicare is #1 in the electric toothbrush category. Next time I will try the Plaque control brush for FlexCare. It is supposed to be even more effective.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and a very good price! I will continue to order again when I need new ones as I have in the past..</li>
            <li> The price paid for this was far less than I would normally pay in a retail box store. The product is the original manufacturers item.</li>
            <li> I have been reading in the reviews about how these lose bristles and flatten out very quickly. Up until this year, I have not seen those problems. This year, several of the brush heads started shedding bristles. Not a lot, but annoying. I changed to a different supplier (still on Amazon) thinking the old supplier had counterfeit products, and had the same problem. So I went back to the previous supplier (both claimed the brush heads were from Philips) and now I have gone through 3 brush heads in less than 1 month! They flatten out very quickly and become ineffective between the teeth. At $25 for 3 heads, it is just crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now going to try generics; they cannot be worse and if they last 3 weeks each, I will be ahead.</li>
            <li> I purchased these replacements and they are the worst toothbrushes I have ever owned...bar none! I have used the first one for only a few weeks, but it looks like I have used it for at least 6 months. I&#x27;m astounded at the lack of quality. I might as well use my manual toothbrush until I can replace these. Don&#x27;t merely walk away from these...run!</li>
            <li> They were worn out after 2 weeks of use. I wasted my money!! Purchased from Phoenix Group of Wilmington. Then I  order from different supplier, then they are great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had about 10 days of use on the first head, it is already flattening out and deteriorating, much like you would expect after 3 months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go to a more reliable seller than this one.</li>
            <li> Great product if you have a Phillips Sonicare. If you don&#x27;t have one you should get one.</li>
            <li> Great for the whole family!</li>
            <li> all of them kept falling off.</li>
            <li> Replacement brushes fit base perfectly.</li>
            <li> Love these. I use these more than the HS6023 compact brush. These also are not cheap.</li>
            <li> After one week use, it got rusted and stuck onto my handle and finally, broke the shaft. See the picture attached.</li>
            <li> Great product, can easily match with my Electric toothbrush. I forget the model no. but I bought it from COSTCO.</li>
            <li> This product not only brushes your teeth, but also stimulates your gums for good oral health.  It is important to have good oral health for good overall health.  Poor oral health can lead to other health problems.  This product helps to greatly improve one&#x27;s health.</li>
            <li> These work as advertised.  If only they&#x27;d still ship them to APO... now I&#x27;m stuck spending twice as much at a local store.  Oh well.</li>
            <li> They do work well but i did find some to break at the bottom from mounting it on my toothbrush everyday, maybe it is the wrong brand but all in all i just had to carefully take it off when switching toothbrushes with my housemates.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Phillips Electric Tooth brush for several years.  It has held up well and works as it should.  I&#x27;ve tried the more expensive electric tooth brushes and always seem to go back to this one.  I like that the brush heads are not as large as the Braun and it leaves my teeth feeling just as clean.</li>
            <li> Works great. Would buy again.  Pretty durable product. Just don&#x27;t press to hard on your teeth. Brushes are a little expensive.</li>
            <li> So far I have only used one of the three heads.  The head fits tight and ultrasonic vibration transmits through head adequately</li>
            <li> I fond these to be good brush heads, better then the compact ones, you have to own a phillips sonic electric tooth brush to make use of these brush heads.</li>
            <li> Sonicare toothbrushes are amazing. I never realized how sub-par my standard toothbrush was until I bought my first Sonicare. As for these replacement brushes, they&#x27;re exactly what I expected. They last about six months which is just right and are identical to the original brush head that came with my unit. Great product.</li>
            <li> Change every three months.</li>
            <li> They work.  Received promptly, they are as described, packed okay.</li>
            <li> I have been using my Sonicare toothbrush now for about 3 years and it is 100% worth its cost!!!  I have taken it with me on my travels throughout the world and the toothbrush and these heads have proven their value each time I have went to the dentist!</li>
            <li> I hate writing my first product review as a negative one, but this needs to be said. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. They have to be counterfeit because after only 2 uses, I experienced extreme bristle fraying (has never happened in my many years with sonicare products) and harsh vibrations. After a week and even replacing the brush heads with another in the set, I noticed my teeth starting to yellow, demonstrating their ineffectiveness.</li>
            <li> These are replacement brushes for the Phillips SoniCare HX6932/10 toothbrush I reviewed in 2010: http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QPW8DYK5RLN0/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rdp_perm .  That is an EXCELLENT toothbrush, and in the nearly 3 years I have been using it, my teeth have been MUCH healthier. The replacement brushes I received were a perfect fit (I checked and tested all 3), and work out to $8/each, as opposed to $8.83/each on the Phillips website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The odd thing here is that I ordered from a vendor who ships from the UK, and their Amazon listing says nothing about this. You find out AFTER you&#x27;ve ordered them, and the projected delivery date is 5-6 weeks away. To be fair, the vendor&#x27;s Amazon storefront DOES says they are UK-based, but who orders from the storefront?  Even weirder are vendors with \\&quot;USA\\&quot; in their name who ALSO ship from England.  Feels a bit scammy.  Anyway, it worked out fine, as they shipped quickly (free) and by airmail, and the brushes arrived on the 9th day following the order (including the Memorial Day weekend, not celebrated in England). I guess the projected delivery date assumes delivery via a slow boat to/from China!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: these brushes are perfect replacements for several models of the Sonicare line, at a slight discount (maybe 20%) off retail. I would reiterate another person&#x27;s comment that you do NOT need to replace these every 3 months, as advised.  The \\&quot;wear indicator\\&quot; is a scam, and shows need for replacement within a few weeks. These brush heads maintain their structural integrity for up to a YEAR, with twice-daily use.  I change mine about every 6 months.  But even at $8/each, they are well worth it if you save on really expensive periodontal procedures.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Works great. Thanks!</li>
