            <li> This worked for me very well a lot smaller than expected but it was usable and a very pretty color.</li>
            <li> I loved this, and loved the color.</li>
            <li> this was a beyond excellant deal... and it&#x27;s a perfect color.. love it...</li>
            <li> this is extremely pale once on. not as shocling as it looks.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and this is a nice pink on me. It&#x27;s not too dark but you can definitely see it. There&#x27;s no shimmer which I love.  It&#x27;s a little hard so it&#x27;s rough on my eyeshadow brush.  It&#x27;s lasted forever, I probably use it 2-3 times a week and have had the same one for over 3 years. The case has held up too which is nice.</li>
            <li> I give the product 5 stars. However, it arrived broken....</li>
            <li> Have used this eye color for years as blush. I have found eye colors don&#x27;t seem to yellow the way blushes do.</li>
            <li> Great color, goes on well, blends well with other color variations. Overall great eye shadow.</li>
            <li> This was ordered for a friend so I can only go by what she tells me. She loves this eye shadow &amp; it is very difficult to find in our area in this shade only. She sates that it stays on all day even when she sweats !  She loves PINK and this is a true pink color. It is easy to apply with the little applicator or with her finger. Hey , All I know for sure is that she says it&#x27;s great and I looked all over for it , finally found it here on amazon. She&#x27;s happy with it and it does NOT irritate her sensitive skin and she does have very sensitive skin especially around the eye area.</li>
            <li> Nice color. thought would be to pale for me but was not.</li>
            <li> I received this product today and I love how easy it glides b on my skin. It&#x27;s a pretty color and texture. I have no complaints at all. I will definitely recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Received broken, but color is amazingly pretty</li>
            <li> The shadow was crumbled into a million pieces.  Very bright color.  It was packaged well though, lots of bubble wrap so I don&#x27;t understand why it was so damaged.  Oh well....</li>
            <li> Very good product. Better price with subscribe and save than any retail store even if you have a coupon.</li>
            <li> Nice bright pink color. Blend with grey and white for a very cute nicki manaj type of look :)</li>
            <li> i am a huge fan of makeup,and i love pink eyeshadow,this product is awsome and i love it,i would buy from these people agian anytime</li>
