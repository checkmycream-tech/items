    <ol>
            <li>No 7 moisturizer added to their foundation products that would be great!</li>
            <li>Olay Definity Color Recapture is an AWESOME product!!!  </li>
            <li>This is one of Oil of Olays best products.</li>
            <li>and Olay Definity has been the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>She rates it as the best</li>
            <li>These two are the best, and after you take it off, you can see that your skin looks improved.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s great for making the skin look smoother, decreasing the appearance of pores, providing some warmth, and of course moisturizing!</li>
            <li>You can find great deals here at Amazon too.  </li>
            <li>My skin complexion looks great but does not look cakey like some foundations/lotions seem to do.</li>
            <li>This is a GREAT combination of the two.</li>
            <li>I get compliments all the time about how great my skin looks when I wear this.</li>
            <li>It goes on very nicely  and has some UV protection.</li>
            <li>It is the best ever for a light tinting of the skin.  </li>
            <li>Amazon seems to have a good price.  </li>
            <li>all I have to say is that is amazing how my face has change in term of even tone and fine lines, is the best I have use before.</li>
            <li>Good moisturizer and nicely evens skin tone.</li>
            <li>LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I love it and will keep using it!  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Wish I could get more!</li>
            <li>This is especially good if you&#x27;re \\&quot;of a certain age.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>This product is good for moisturizing, more of a tinted moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It nicely covers lighter and darker spots on her face.</li>
            <li>Initially I really liked this product.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;fair to light\\&quot; shade was TOO LIGHT.  </li>
            <li>The product went on evenly and smooth, it was satisfyingly moisturizing, and it looked good.</li>
            <li>And the sunscreen is great because it&#x27;s important, but MORE IMPORTANT is the fact that it has NOT made me break out.</li>
            <li>At first it was great.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I love what it did for my skin and skin-tone.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>Now add to that foundation over it, and to me it&#x27;s just an okay</li>
            <li>I visited Oil Of Olay&#x27;s interactive website to see which products would suit me best, and after several attempts, I kept getting Definity as the product I should try.  </li>
            <li>Been using it for years--use a moisturizer beneath and this on top  </li>
            <li>This product is just fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I always make sure I put it on my neck as well.  </li>
            <li>You have to try this, you will love it too.</li>
            <li>, I saw it on clearance at Walgreens, so if you like this product as is, be sure to pick it up before they change it.</li>
            <li>I love the light weight of the Olay Color Recapture!  </li>
            <li>However, if you desire more coverage, Color Recapture will be too transparent.</li>
            <li>, She hasent found any thing Better.   </li>
            <li>Love it because it has sun protection, color tint and is a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>or if you want even more coverage, like a foundation, try Aveeno tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The concept of this product and its pretty swirl contents is awesome, but please be aware this product is NOT for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I thought I&#x27;d discovered a new great product.</li>
            <li>Marking rubs off easily over time and they do not put the color on it.  </li>
            <li>It goes on so easy and stays on.  </li>
            <li>It is great for daily wear</li>
            <li>I am 72 years old, and I love, love, love Olay Definity Color Recapture.    </li>
            <li>I like the light coverage with this product, plus all the benefits of Olay products.  </li>
            <li>I use a light powder after applying to set and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>This item doesn&#x27;t seem to be available in stores.  </li>
            <li>I use the Garnier when going to work for light coverage and then Aveeno for weekends if I&#x27;m going out.</li>
            <li>This product is great for moisturizing and improving skin, and with sheer coverage evening skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant about trying this because I really did need something that was actually going to moisturize as well as work as a foundation, but this was PERFECT!</li>
            <li>I gave it a try, and am not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>moisturizer - nothing special.  </li>
            <li>I love this product as well as they whole line of Definity products.</li>
            <li>It has really good coverage for a sheer makeup and gives my skin a youthful glow, which at my age of 52 is a bonus!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cover good enough for me for going to work but</li>
            <li>Great product--have referred at least 6 friends and they love it too</li>
            <li>I never had any reaction like others did and it does give a nice light cover up of the minor imperfections.</li>
            <li>Very light substance and not heavy on the face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my mid-30s, who rarely wears makeup during the week, who is looking for a tinted moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I only bought this because I liked  the idea of an illuminating coverage with sun</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product to anyone since there are so many other options out there using ingredients that don&#x27;t seem to cause as many issues.  </li>
            <li>and this feels and looks just right.  </li>
            <li>Used to buy it at Target but had to purchase it at Amazon since Target doesn&#x27;t carry it right now.  </li>
            <li>My only caution is this: My skin is fair, and yet the light to medium provides me with enough color.  </li>
            <li>but I still need something else when I want more make-up coverage or extra UV protction.</li>
            <li>I first apply Olay Regenerist Regenerating Serum and then cover with Olay Definity Color Recapture.    </li>
            <li>When this product first came out in my area, I thought, \\&quot;hrmmm...\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>In about an hour, the color is absorbed into my combination skin, pretty much blunting any of the foundation-substitute effects touted by reviewers here.</li>
            <li>With so many people responding with similar testimonies, I feel that it&#x27;s negligent for Olay to continue marketing this product.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>;-)  </li>
            <li>It is so pretty too.  </li>
            <li>(I really like this product!)</li>
            <li>cause my face looks so fresh and youth, thanks Olay.</li>
            <li>I bought this product a few years ago at the suggestion of a good friend who said she wore it everyday and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I wish I had something positive to say about this product</li>
            <li>Firstly, it&#x27;s not a heavy duty foundation or a concealer, and therefore won&#x27;t provide full on coverage.</li>
            <li>Most foundations dry out my skin, and  I look as if I am peeling from a sunburn.   </li>
            <li>Since the reaction has begun, I&#x27;ve been applying moisturizer three or four times more often throughout the day, and my skin is still dry and peeling in places.   </li>
            <li>and I have super sensitive skin that always breaks out.  </li>
            <li>My skin has also been super soft since using this product...</li>
            <li>This is a good product, but I would prefer something that adds just a touch of bronze tone to my very pale face</li>
            <li>And, it didn&#x27;t take a whole lot to cover what needed</li>
            <li>I do, however, really like the Definity Eye Illuminator.  </li>
            <li>Really evens out my skin tone without a \\&quot;made-up\\&quot; look.</li>
            <li>and I can really tell a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>The effect is that of a gentle touch from Mother Nature.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had hives twice in my life, and it&#x27;s kind of like that: itchy, puffy, with skin unevenly raised.</li>
            <li>I have used many moisturizers and facial masks and do not consider myself to have sensitive skin; however, when I put this on my face, by the time I got to work, the skin around my nose and mouth was pinkish/red.</li>
            <li>It leaves you with this \\&quot;sheen\\&quot; that no one would be able to pinpoint, no sparkles or anything ridiculous, and people have asked me if I&#x27;m pregnant twice, because they say I&#x27;m glowing.</li>
            <li>By the end of the third day, it was starting to get better.</li>
            <li>and I looked 15 years older.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, and when I follow with loose powder, I feel I have a polished daytime look without looking \\&quot;over done\\</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The OLAY Definity evened out the tone of my skin and with a little pressed powder over the top, concealed the melasma patches on my forehead.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product thinking that I would love it as much as I love other Olay products I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li>When I got home, I actually had WRINKLES on my forehead and around my mouth (smile lines).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that I would recommend this for people with oily skin, they might not like the moisturizing aspect, but I have normal skin and live in the desert</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not yet 30, I almost never go out in the sun uncovered, so while I don&#x27;t look like a super model I still have decent skin; but, skin alone, I currently look closer to 50 -- especially around the eyes.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin - DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>The hint of color in this moisturizer is just the right amount to cover up minor flaws in my skin.</li>
            <li>I found this product to feel heavy on the skin and had oil breakthrough very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I am finding, however, that even when my medium skin is lighter in winter that the light/medium is a little light.  </li>
            <li>This morning, my face is puffy, red in spots and VERY itchy.</li>
            <li>It makes your face so soft and toned.</li>
            <li>It looks SO natural.  </li>
            <li>I have relatively sensitive skin</li>
            <li>&quot; (I am a 52 year old teacher).  </li>
            <li>too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note, I do NOT have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>but wore it anyway because I spent so much money!  </li>
            <li>Major bummer.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Olay-ProX, Olay Regenerist, ROC Retinol and ROC Brilliance products for sometime, so I have experience in the category in general and with Olay in particular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Currently, I am using the product as a foundation primer with Bare Escentuals Matte &amp; Mineral Veil.</li>
            <li>Be especially cautious if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m afraid an allergic reaction trumps anything good I have to say.  </li>
            <li>I use it as a foundation, and it provides just the right amount of coverage, not too heavy.  </li>
            <li>At the end of the day I am still glowing with no dry spots.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of expensive, but here&#x27;s what it actually is: it&#x27;s almost like a makeup primer, sunscreen and illuminator in one.</li>
            <li>I used this product for about a year with no problem, and then noticed that the color was really too dark at light/medium, so I stopped using it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, after nearly a month of use, I saw no visible results, compared to visible results with nearly every other Olay product that I tried.</li>
            <li>Just last night I used it for the first time in a little over a month.</li>
            <li>I have seen the product sold for as much at $30.00 at some drugstores to as little as $19.00 at Walmart.  </li>

            <li> And, it didn&#x27;t take a whole lot to cover what needed</li>
            <li> I do, however, really like the Definity Eye Illuminator.  </li>
            <li> Really evens out my skin tone without a \\&quot;made-up\\&quot; look.</li>
            <li> and I can really tell a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> The effect is that of a gentle touch from Mother Nature.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had hives twice in my life, and it&#x27;s kind of like that: itchy, puffy, with skin unevenly raised.</li>
            <li> I have used many moisturizers and facial masks and do not consider myself to have sensitive skin; however, when I put this on my face, by the time I got to work, the skin around my nose and mouth was pinkish/red.</li>
            <li> It leaves you with this \\&quot;sheen\\&quot; that no one would be able to pinpoint, no sparkles or anything ridiculous, and people have asked me if I&#x27;m pregnant twice, because they say I&#x27;m glowing.</li>
            <li> By the end of the third day, it was starting to get better.</li>
            <li> and I looked 15 years older.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, and when I follow with loose powder, I feel I have a polished daytime look without looking \\&quot;over done\\</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The OLAY Definity evened out the tone of my skin and with a little pressed powder over the top, concealed the melasma patches on my forehead.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking that I would love it as much as I love other Olay products I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> When I got home, I actually had WRINKLES on my forehead and around my mouth (smile lines).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that I would recommend this for people with oily skin, they might not like the moisturizing aspect, but I have normal skin and live in the desert</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not yet 30, I almost never go out in the sun uncovered, so while I don&#x27;t look like a super model I still have decent skin; but, skin alone, I currently look closer to 50 -- especially around the eyes.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin - DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> The hint of color in this moisturizer is just the right amount to cover up minor flaws in my skin.</li>
            <li> I found this product to feel heavy on the skin and had oil breakthrough very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I am finding, however, that even when my medium skin is lighter in winter that the light/medium is a little light.  </li>
            <li> This morning, my face is puffy, red in spots and VERY itchy.</li>
            <li> It makes your face so soft and toned.</li>
            <li> It looks SO natural.  </li>
            <li> I have relatively sensitive skin</li>
            <li> &quot; (I am a 52 year old teacher).  </li>
            <li> too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note, I do NOT have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> but wore it anyway because I spent so much money!  </li>
            <li> Major bummer.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Olay-ProX, Olay Regenerist, ROC Retinol and ROC Brilliance products for sometime, so I have experience in the category in general and with Olay in particular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Currently, I am using the product as a foundation primer with Bare Escentuals Matte &amp; Mineral Veil.</li>
            <li> Be especially cautious if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m afraid an allergic reaction trumps anything good I have to say.  </li>
            <li> I use it as a foundation, and it provides just the right amount of coverage, not too heavy.  </li>
            <li> At the end of the day I am still glowing with no dry spots.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of expensive, but here&#x27;s what it actually is: it&#x27;s almost like a makeup primer, sunscreen and illuminator in one.</li>
            <li> I used this product for about a year with no problem, and then noticed that the color was really too dark at light/medium, so I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, after nearly a month of use, I saw no visible results, compared to visible results with nearly every other Olay product that I tried.</li>
            <li> Just last night I used it for the first time in a little over a month.</li>
            <li> I have seen the product sold for as much at $30.00 at some drugstores to as little as $19.00 at Walmart.  </li>
            <li> It took me a few tries to get used to the texture of the moisturizer, but after several months of use, I can say I really like the product.  </li>
            <li> Although the effect is subtle, it really does make your skin look smoother, just as foundation should!</li>
            <li> It took 3 days for my skin to recouperate and for the wrinkles to fill out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give it another chance the next week thinking maybe I applied too much last time, but I got the same results -- blotchy skin, but this time less wrinkles formed.  </li>
            <li> (I have dark circles under my eyes from constant sinus issues, and melasma from a former birth control &#x27;scrip I am no longer taking).  </li>
            <li> Since I was just giving it a try, I washed it off not too long after and went to bed.</li>
            <li> , it was too heavy, more expensive and came in a smaller container.</li>
            <li> I am in my early thirties and have no wrinkles, but I do have uneven skin tone and some age spots, so I tried this because of all of the rave reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finding that I use less Bare Escentuals when I use the Color Recapture product in this fashion.</li>
            <li> In addition, it somehow seems to highlight the size of my pores, which are larger than average on my nose &amp; through the T-zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews here, I&#x27;m relieved I didn&#x27;t keep it on my face for very long the first time; the reaction could have been much worse.  </li>
            <li> It seems a little pricy, but you only need one (MAYBE one and a half) pumps of the product at a time, so it will last a while.</li>
            <li> In addition, my skin seems to get especially oily &amp; wet-looking in a few hours after using it alone.</li>
            <li> so I do have to be careful what I use</li>
            <li> Used to wear department store foundation, spent a lot of money and didn&#x27;t always like the product</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, and I can wear this all day without reapplying or having my skin feel tight.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see the \\&quot;glow\\&quot; other people seem to get.  </li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t think of using any other brand.</li>
            <li> My face became puffy and red and itched worse through the following day.</li>
            <li> There are three active ingredients in this product:</li>
            <li> It was some thing different try it once Was not happy with this product I will go back to my Revlon</li>
            <li> and now I have some steroids to bring down the inflammation.  </li>
            <li> I have searched online a little and have found that the active ingredients in the sunblock can cause allergic reactions.  </li>
            <li> warning is on the back of the bottle in VERY small print.</li>
            <li> I tried it twice to make sure it was the makeup that was giving me a terrible rash on my face, and it was definitely the culprit.  </li>
            <li> We found the correct item at Target for $5.00 less per bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not sure if I will purchase it again after this tube is empty.</li>
            <li> In addition, the product did little for evening my skin tone.</li>
            <li> It seems to hide the little imperfections</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the feel or look of heavy foundation</li>
            <li> My problem is that after just a few hours my face looks shiny and greasy.</li>
            <li> After researching it online, i found others too had the same or worse reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t find it expensive, as I normally use Lancôme products, but I am just not that crazy about it.  </li>
            <li> My skin is usually dry, but it&#x27;s not too bad as long as I moisturize.</li>
            <li> it out of the mailbox a little worse for transit-but still useable.  </li>
            <li> I have looked for at least six months for a 1.7oz.</li>
            <li> Which of course I didnt look to read until after the negative affect on my skin to this product.</li>
            <li> Through the course of the day my face puffed up, started burning, tender, and now I have a serious looking sunburn on my face with lines of demarcation from where the makeup was applied.  </li>
            <li> The next morning I woke up with horribly itchy skin everywhere</li>
            <li> I suspect I&#x27;ll look like myself again once the reaction finally wears off, but in the meantime it&#x27;s rather awful.</li>
            <li> This product was awful on my skin.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.  It goes on very nicely  and has some UV protection. It is great for daily wear but I still need something else when I want more make-up coverage or extra UV protction.</li>
            <li> I am 72 years old, and I love, love, love Olay Definity Color Recapture.    Most foundations dry out my skin, and  I look as if I am peeling from a sunburn.   Not a problem with this product.  I first apply Olay Regenerist Regenerating Serum and then cover with Olay Definity Color Recapture.    At the end of the day I am still glowing with no dry spots. Thank you, Olay.  PLEASE DO NOT DISCONTINUE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> This product is good for moisturizing, more of a tinted moisturizer.  Pump works well.  Package labeling needs to be improved  Marking rubs off easily over time and they do not put the color on it.  If Oil of Olay Pro-X can work a deal with Revlon and L&#x27;Oreal Products to have the Pro-X moisturizer or Boots No 7 moisturizer added to their foundation products that would be great!</li>
            <li> When this product first came out in my area, I thought, \\&quot;hrmmm...\\&quot;.  Then I started looking around for it.  Wal-Mart wanted $28 for 1.7 oz...stupid price for someone on my budget.  I have looked for at least six months for a 1.7oz. container of this product that I could afford.  Found it via Amazon.  $13.00?  Are you kidding me?  Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got it out of the mailbox a little worse for transit-but still useable.  I love what it did for my skin and skin-tone.  (I have dark circles under my eyes from constant sinus issues, and melasma from a former birth control &#x27;scrip I am no longer taking).  The OLAY Definity evened out the tone of my skin and with a little pressed powder over the top, concealed the melasma patches on my forehead.  It&#x27;s light--it does NOT feel like I&#x27;ve put on a mask before going out.  And, it didn&#x27;t take a whole lot to cover what needed to be covered.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. It&#x27;s kind of expensive, but here&#x27;s what it actually is: it&#x27;s almost like a makeup primer, sunscreen and illuminator in one. There&#x27;s just enough foundation in it so that after you apply, you only need to add concealer in problem spots. It leaves you with this \\&quot;sheen\\&quot; that no one would be able to pinpoint, no sparkles or anything ridiculous, and people have asked me if I&#x27;m pregnant twice, because they say I&#x27;m glowing. And the sunscreen is great because it&#x27;s important, but MORE IMPORTANT is the fact that it has NOT made me break out. And EVERYTHING makes me break out. I have an oily t-zone, and normal/dry everywhere else. I don&#x27;t have to use a moisurizer at all anymore, and I haven&#x27;t had to increase my t-zone powdering either. If that helps. I highly recommend this product. Also, one pump covers your entire face, and there&#x27;s always a bit left over, which I use on my decollete area - just an idea.</li>
            <li> I like the light coverage with this product, plus all the benefits of Olay products.  I use a light powder after applying to set and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This product was awful on my skin.  I tried it twice to make sure it was the makeup that was giving me a terrible rash on my face, and it was definitely the culprit.  I would never use this again.</li>
            <li> I obviously am in the minority here, but I just don&#x27;t get what all the fuss is about this product.  Admittedly, I AM a foundation wearer, so maybe that&#x27;s the difference.  When I put this on, I see no perceptible difference on my face.  I don&#x27;t see the \\&quot;glow\\&quot; other people seem to get.  Now add to that foundation over it, and to me it&#x27;s just an okay moisturizer - nothing special.  I personally don&#x27;t find it expensive, as I normally use Lancôme products, but I am just not that crazy about it.  I do, however, really like the Definity Eye Illuminator.  To me it truly does impart a luminosity to the under-eye area, even under foundation.</li>
            <li> I found this product to feel heavy on the skin and had oil breakthrough very quickly.  My skin actually felt sticky.</li>
            <li> Not real big on foundation so thought I would try this. LOVE it! Really evens out my skin tone without a \\&quot;made-up\\&quot; look. Go Olay!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for months.  I visited Oil Of Olay&#x27;s interactive website to see which products would suit me best, and after several attempts, I kept getting Definity as the product I should try.  I&#x27;m in my mid-30s, who rarely wears makeup during the week, who is looking for a tinted moisturizer.  It took me a few tries to get used to the texture of the moisturizer, but after several months of use, I can say I really like the product.  You can find great deals here at Amazon too.  My only caution is this: My skin is fair, and yet the light to medium provides me with enough color.  The \\&quot;fair to light\\&quot; shade was TOO LIGHT.  One squirt is all I need to cover my entire face.  The product lasts me months at a time.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years--use a moisturizer beneath and this on top  (so I am actually double moisturizing) with some blush and eye make up and have been getting rave compliments about my skin for several years--I am 68 and do also have an Obagi face peel once a year.  Don&#x27;t like the feel or look of heavy foundation and this feels and looks just right.  Great product--have referred at least 6 friends and they love it too</li>
            <li> I purchased this Olay combination item as an option for reducing the amount of product on my skin during warmer summer months. I have been using Olay-ProX, Olay Regenerist, ROC Retinol and ROC Brilliance products for sometime, so I have experience in the category in general and with Olay in particular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, after nearly a month of use, I saw no visible results, compared to visible results with nearly every other Olay product that I tried. In addition, the product did little for evening my skin tone. In about an hour, the color is absorbed into my combination skin, pretty much blunting any of the foundation-substitute effects touted by reviewers here. In addition, my skin seems to get especially oily &amp; wet-looking in a few hours after using it alone. In addition, it somehow seems to highlight the size of my pores, which are larger than average on my nose &amp; through the T-zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently, I am using the product as a foundation primer with Bare Escentuals Matte &amp; Mineral Veil. I&#x27;m finding that I use less Bare Escentuals when I use the Color Recapture product in this fashion. In addition, my foundation seems to stay in place for a bit longer and look a bit nicer. But I&#x27;m not sure if I will purchase it again after this tube is empty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been five days since I used this product, and my face still hasn&#x27;t fully recovered.   At first it was great. The product went on evenly and smooth, it was satisfyingly moisturizing, and it looked good. I tried it in the evening just to see how it was and I thought I&#x27;d discovered a new great product. Since I was just giving it a try, I washed it off not too long after and went to bed. The next morning I woke up with horribly itchy skin everywhere I&#x27;d put the product. My face became puffy and red and itched worse through the following day. I&#x27;ve had hives twice in my life, and it&#x27;s kind of like that: itchy, puffy, with skin unevenly raised. It seems to be an allergic reaction.   By the end of the third day, it was starting to get better. It&#x27;s been five days now and it no longer itches, but it&#x27;s still puffy especially under my eyes. The puffiness highlights wrinkles I never knew I had. I&#x27;m not yet 30, I almost never go out in the sun uncovered, so while I don&#x27;t look like a super model I still have decent skin; but, skin alone, I currently look closer to 50 -- especially around the eyes. I suspect I&#x27;ll look like myself again once the reaction finally wears off, but in the meantime it&#x27;s rather awful. It&#x27;s the anti-anti-aging. My skin is usually dry, but it&#x27;s not too bad as long as I moisturize. Since the reaction has begun, I&#x27;ve been applying moisturizer three or four times more often throughout the day, and my skin is still dry and peeling in places.   After reading the other reviews here, I&#x27;m relieved I didn&#x27;t keep it on my face for very long the first time; the reaction could have been much worse.  There are three active ingredients in this product: 3% Octisalate, 3% Octocrylene, 2% Avobenzone. I wish I knew which of them I&#x27;m having the allergic reaction to, so then I&#x27;d know what to avoid in future products. I&#x27;ve never had a reaction like this before, and I hope I never have one like it again.  With so many people responding with similar testimonies, I feel that it&#x27;s negligent for Olay to continue marketing this product.</li>
            <li> I used this product for about a year with no problem, and then noticed that the color was really too dark at light/medium, so I stopped using it. Just last night I used it for the first time in a little over a month. After washing my face last night my face was red, and felt like it was sun burned. This morning, my face is puffy, red in spots and VERY itchy. If you have sensitive skin - DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I bought this cream to my mom, and she loves it. It nicely covers lighter and darker spots on her face. I&#x27;ll buy one again.</li>
            <li> Olay Definity Color Recapture is an AWESOME product!!!  I use it as a foundation, and it provides just the right amount of coverage, not too heavy.  Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and hasn&#x27;t made me break out... and I have super sensitive skin that always breaks out.  Saves time because there is the coverage and sun screen in one product! My skin has also been super soft since using this product... just an added benefit I suppose!  It seems a little pricy, but you only need one (MAYBE one and a half) pumps of the product at a time, so it will last a while.</li>
            <li> This is a must have product. This is one of Oil of Olays best products. It makes your face so soft and toned. You don&#x27;t have to where makeup. I don&#x27;t where makeup anymore. I love this product as well as they whole line of Definity products. I recommend this product to whoever I can.</li>
            <li> This product is just fantastic!  I love it and will keep using it!  It goes on so easy and stays on.  It makes my face look even toned all over.  It seems to hide the little imperfections ;) I always make sure I put it on my neck as well.  It looks SO natural.  You have to try this, you will love it too.</li>
            <li> Product took ten days to arrive.  We ended up with the correct label on the packing list but the product does not match the packing list.  No phone number to call and no return information.  Major bummer.  We found the correct item at Target for $5.00 less per bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck</li>
            <li> I ended up buying this to try out after Clinique did away with their Almost Makeup line - a product I&#x27;d used for 15 years. I didn&#x27;t like Clinique&#x27;s replacement line at all, it was too heavy, more expensive and came in a smaller container. I set out to find something comparable that had an spf also and Olay Definity has been the best I&#x27;ve found. It has really good coverage for a sheer makeup and gives my skin a youthful glow, which at my age of 52 is a bonus! I don&#x27;t know that I would recommend this for people with oily skin, they might not like the moisturizing aspect, but I have normal skin and live in the desert so having makeup that moisturizes too is imperative. I should say I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon but if you&#x27;re like me, this is where I come to read reviews on just about everything I plan on buying!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Olay product for several months now and I can really tell a difference in my skin. I have no complaints whatsoever. My skin complexion looks great but does not look cakey like some foundations/lotions seem to do. I also have no breakouts while using it. I now have my mom and grandma also using it. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I have been using Olay tinted moisturizer for about 8 years.  It is the best ever for a light tinting of the skin.  Very light substance and not heavy on the face.  Evens out all skin tones.  Wouldn&#x27;t think of using any other brand.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but I would prefer something that adds just a touch of bronze tone to my very pale face</li>
            <li> I really like it. It doesn&#x27;t cover good enough for me for going to work but that&#x27;s all I wear on the weekend.  Good moisturizer and nicely evens skin tone.</li>
            <li> Initially I really liked this product. I never had any reaction like others did and it does give a nice light cover up of the minor imperfections. My problem is that after just a few hours my face looks shiny and greasy. To the point that it&#x27;s even noticeable in photos. So too shiny and oily for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking that I would love it as much as I love other Olay products I&#x27;ve used in the past.  I have relatively sensitive skin so I do have to be careful what I use but I&#x27;ve never had a reaction like this before.  I put it on this morning and after a while I noticed my neck was itchy, itchy throat, had a headache, and found some red blotchy marks on my face and neck.  Through the course of the day my face puffed up, started burning, tender, and now I have a serious looking sunburn on my face with lines of demarcation from where the makeup was applied.  I went to the doctor&#x27;s this evening and now I have some steroids to bring down the inflammation.  I wish I had something positive to say about this product but I&#x27;m afraid an allergic reaction trumps anything good I have to say.  I have searched online a little and have found that the active ingredients in the sunblock can cause allergic reactions.  I would not recommend this product to anyone since there are so many other options out there using ingredients that don&#x27;t seem to cause as many issues.  Be especially cautious if you have sensitive skin.  A $20 product cost me $40 in specialty co-pay and $20 for the steroids.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a few years ago at the suggestion of a good friend who said she wore it everyday and loved it.  I gave it a try, and am not disappointed.  Used to wear department store foundation, spent a lot of money and didn&#x27;t always like the product but wore it anyway because I spent so much money!  The Olay color recapture gives me just enough foundation coverage with the added benefit of daily sunscreen plus moisturizer.  It goes on smoothly, and when I follow with loose powder, I feel I have a polished daytime look without looking \\&quot;over done\\&quot; (I am a 52 year old teacher).  Amazon seems to have a good price.  I have seen the product sold for as much at $30.00 at some drugstores to as little as $19.00 at Walmart.  I think Olay is switching the Definity line to their Total Effects line, I saw it on clearance at Walgreens, so if you like this product as is, be sure to pick it up before they change it.</li>
            <li> It was some thing different try it once Was not happy with this product I will go back to my Revlon</li>
            <li> I love the light weight of the Olay Color Recapture!  It contributes moisture and color so gently there&#x27;s no sense of a heavy layer. The effect is that of a gentle touch from Mother Nature.  This is especially good if you&#x27;re \\&quot;of a certain age.\\&quot;  ;-)  Nothing settles in even the finest lines!  However, if you desire more coverage, Color Recapture will be too transparent.</li>
            <li> This product was bought for my wife.      She rates it as the best, She hasent found any thing Better.   Jerry Neeb</li>
            <li> This item doesn&#x27;t seem to be available in stores.  Used to buy it at Target but had to purchase it at Amazon since Target doesn&#x27;t carry it right now.  Love it because it has sun protection, color tint and is a moisturizer.  It is so pretty too.  Looks like a mixed flavor softie ice cream.</li>
            <li> I am in my early thirties and have no wrinkles, but I do have uneven skin tone and some age spots, so I tried this because of all of the rave reviews. I have used many moisturizers and facial masks and do not consider myself to have sensitive skin; however, when I put this on my face, by the time I got to work, the skin around my nose and mouth was pinkish/red. When I got home, I actually had WRINKLES on my forehead and around my mouth (smile lines). I was freaking out! I washed the product off immediately and rubbed castor oil and vitamin e oil into my face to even out the wrinkles. I still had wrinkles the next day. It took 3 days for my skin to recouperate and for the wrinkles to fill out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give it another chance the next week thinking maybe I applied too much last time, but I got the same results -- blotchy skin, but this time less wrinkles formed.  I looked in the mirror at the end of the day and my face actually DROOPED and I looked 15 years older. I will NEVER EVER use this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend Garnier Beauty Balm (BB) tinted moisturizer (I really like this product!) or if you want even more coverage, like a foundation, try Aveeno tinted moisturizer. These two are the best, and after you take it off, you can see that your skin looks improved. I switch between the Garnier and Aveeno. I use the Garnier when going to work for light coverage and then Aveeno for weekends if I&#x27;m going out. I wear both at night sometimes too to moisturize and it doesn&#x27;t cause me to breakout.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT combination of the two. Firstly, it&#x27;s not a heavy duty foundation or a concealer, and therefore won&#x27;t provide full on coverage. However, it&#x27;s great for making the skin look smoother, decreasing the appearance of pores, providing some warmth, and of course moisturizing! I was hesitant about trying this because I really did need something that was actually going to moisturize as well as work as a foundation, but this was PERFECT! I have dry skin, and I can wear this all day without reapplying or having my skin feel tight. I get compliments all the time about how great my skin looks when I wear this. Although the effect is subtle, it really does make your skin look smoother, just as foundation should!</li>
            <li> The hint of color in this moisturizer is just the right amount to cover up minor flaws in my skin. The moisturier always keeps my skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 4 years now all I have to say is that is amazing how my face has change in term of even tone and fine lines, is the best I have use before. I am 38 and everyone thinks I am 28 no joke cause my face looks so fresh and youth, thanks Olay.</li>
            <li> Wish I could get more!</li>
            <li> The concept of this product and its pretty swirl contents is awesome, but please be aware this product is NOT for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The warning is on the back of the bottle in VERY small print. Which of course I didnt look to read until after the negative affect on my skin to this product. After researching it online, i found others too had the same or worse reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my case, 15 minutes after applying Olay Definity, my face began to STING and ITCH. When I looked in the mirror my entire face was completely RED. It looked as if I were laying in the sun for hours without sunscreen.. and it felt that way too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note, I do NOT have sensitive skin. I only bought this because I liked  the idea of an illuminating coverage with sun screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest you sample some before you actually buy it!  U can apply a nickle size dab on the side of your neck and see if it gets red or begins to burn. If it does, DO NOT BUY it. you can always hide the irritated area with your hair (or u can test it on ur arm or leg). Once u stop applying, it should go away in 1-3 days.</li>
            <li> This product is great for moisturizing and improving skin, and with sheer coverage evening skin tone.  I am finding, however, that even when my medium skin is lighter in winter that the light/medium is a little light.  I wish that Oil of Olay would make three tones - i.e.  have a separate medium shade.</li>
