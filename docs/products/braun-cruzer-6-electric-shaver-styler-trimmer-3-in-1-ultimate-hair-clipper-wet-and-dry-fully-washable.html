            <li>I was originally impressed and happy with the CruZer6 Face shaver from Braun.  </li>
            <li>Also the product itself looks really good!</li>
            <li>The design is beautiful.</li>
            <li>The trimming parts of this razor work great.</li>
            <li>Great for detailing.</li>
            <li>Would make a great travel razor</li>
            <li>I looked on Amazon.com, found the razor and my husband was a happy camper when he opened up his package on Christmas morning.</li>
            <li>The adjustable guard feels flimsy when you move it, but it holds great when you trimming.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The product does great for pubic regions with the adjustable trimmer.</li>
            <li>Great shaver.</li>
            <li>Great attachments.</li>
            <li>When used as a trimmer for the \\&quot;scruffy\\&quot; look, this is a great shaver.  </li>
            <li>Great choice.</li>
            <li>So, I give it 4 stars to say that \\&quot;I like it\\&quot;, but still lacks great value and quality.  </li>
            <li>great add-on.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job of trimmer my beard to keep the length where I want it.  </li>
            <li>The foil works great around the ears.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use the beard atachments, but the shaver is a great value with all the features it does have.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what is so great about this shaver...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I bought the Cruzer Face 6.</li>
            <li>For the price and performance seemed to read me a great machine.</li>
            <li>this shaver works great for years, I broke trimmer part and can not find replacement part so use rubber band to hold it on while trimming beard.</li>
            <li>The trimmer works great.</li>
            <li>The Beard and mustache trimmer are Great.</li>
            <li>Therefore I have used the adjustable beard trimmer with great satisfaction.</li>
            <li>There are more attachments and gizmos here, to get your beard to be perfectly groomed, than you can imagine.</li>
            <li>I think its OK, not the best though.</li>
            <li>Great shaver and a good price.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed with this shaver and enjoy using it!</li>
            <li>so it wasn&#x27;t a pleasant experience while this was happening.</li>
            <li>It gave me a good close shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been told that your skin needs to get used to the shaver in order to get a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a good priced shaver, this is the one.</li>
            <li>Good price too.</li>
            <li>The lack of holder spaces for the attachments is not so good, so I have deducted a star for that.  </li>
            <li>Has nice attachments and looks great.</li>
            <li>it is really good and shaving good  </li>
            <li>It is gorgeous.</li>
            <li>So its a good foil shaver- if you are looking for that, its in the mix.  </li>
            <li>The Good:  </li>
            <li>Good for a trimmer, that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>This is a good, versatile, electric razor/trimmer.  </li>
            <li>seller is good too</li>
            <li>It feels good.  </li>
            <li>razor portion is about as good as I could expect.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Build quality is extremely good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Would recommend to anyone looking for a good quality mustash &amp; beard trimmer&lt;</li>
            <li>Holds a good charge.</li>
            <li>son called me the day after Christmas to proudly tell me he was all trimmed up and really liked it.</li>
            <li>Well, it&#x27;s a really good shaver.  </li>
            <li>No electric will get as close as the blade, but this does a good job in between.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>The shaver however, did not do as good a job as a razor edge, but it did get 95% of all the hairs, and I used a razor to nick the rest.</li>
            <li>I have to admit, under my chin, the series 7 does a good job of getting I&#x27;d say about 98% of all my hairs.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>Bought this product after reading some good reviews.</li>
            <li>The shaver is excellent for my neck area where I prefer to remain clean shaven and define my beard.</li>
            <li>The trimmers and the length attachment work exceptionally well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon service was Exceptional.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>So many shavers are just not that great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not overly impressed with the shaver, but the trimmer is the bestI&#x27;ve used for my face so that alone makes this product worth it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very satisfied and the seller shipped the product instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What Braun has here is a good quality (4 star) foil shaver with a nice stand and charging system.  </li>
            <li>It is a handy shaver that fits well in the hand, and it comes with some good trimmer features.  </li>
            <li>My ideal shaver is one that lets me clean my neck and cheeks up, trim up my sideburns and eyebrows, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>then it&#x27;s a wonderful shaver in it&#x27;s own right.  </li>
            <li>(another feature I love!).  </li>
            <li>You will need a real honest trimmer to handle the tougher full beard and goatee</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t think I could have bought anything better!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The combs included are great, it&#x27;s easy to regulate the length of beard you want to have with</li>
            <li>On a brighter note, I&#x27;ve had to rely on my trusty Gillette Sensor Mach 3, which works wonderfully well and has never let me down.ach 3, which works wonderfully well and has never let me down.</li>
            <li>Really amazing machine.</li>
            <li>Get it with this amazing product.</li>
            <li>also use the foil blade, which again, works great for guys with light beards.</li>
            <li>and kind of let it go.  </li>
            <li>The Braun Cruzer 6 Face is a handy trimmer/shaver, but if you have a course beard, it does take a bit to get a close shave.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice feature.  </li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s nice that I can just run it under water to rinse all of the hairs off of it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Basically, I&#x27;ve never come across any multi-use product that wasn&#x27;t effective at even one of its advertised features.  </li>
            <li>I very much liked the number of attachments it came with and versatility of the shaver.  </li>
            <li>They keep my sideburns nice and trimmed, the way i like them.</li>
            <li>.it works effectively</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for trimming your beard, and the foil shaver gives you a nice close shave on the parts you want smooth.  </li>
            <li>I bought this shaver as a gift for my son and he really liked it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have both in one unit.</li>
            <li>Its nice and does its job well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product with many functions and acessories.</li>
            <li>, it has a nice design</li>
            <li>it is one of the greatest shaving machine i have ever use it is really fabulous specially once i have tried it under the water</li>
            <li>impressive is the fact that it has full waterproof functionality, which means one can use it in the shower, sink-rinse it, etc., which makes it hugely functional.</li>
            <li>Equally impressive is the fact that it has full waterproof functionality, which means one can use it in the shower, sink-rinse it, etc., which makes it hugely functional.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To have the best shave, it&#x27;s better to trim first</li>
            <li>Still going strong and couldn&#x27;t be more happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>The razor itself looks cool and runs great.</li>
            <li>I just wish it worked better and more efficiently at getting a good close shave in one or two passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>great item, fantastic to use for the body as well as for the face.&lt;br /&gt;it comes with great tools and it&#x27;s very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;i really recommend this item!</li>
            <li>After using it I&#x27;m sure that it might be great for styling but from the first time i used it it wasn&#x27;t any good for a close shave.</li>
            <li>It is very good for what it does.&lt;br /&gt;Important: battery really lasts and charges fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When used as a close shaver, it may not be the best option for those with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>So far, this works wonderful.</li>
            <li>It had attachments to trim his beard which he found extremely effective &amp; user friendly!</li>
            <li>Good product with many thoughtful features.</li>
            <li>The electric razor is excellent for a quick upkeep on the clean shaven part of my face although I still use blade razor if I want a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>to fast shipping to Turkey, to beautiful machine.</li>
            <li>Still causes light irritation and to get a clean shave it takes a while, will stick with it for a while and see if its the lack of experience from the user or the product just ain&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li>It has held up well and works exceptionally well in some areas and as best as can be expected in others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On a positive note it is great to travel with.  </li>
            <li>It trimmed my goatee very well and did a great job on my body hair.</li>
            <li>Comparable and even better</li>
            <li>He has had just the 3 circle foil razors for years and wanted something that could do more.</li>
            <li>positives of this shaver/trimmer are many.</li>
            <li>trimmer however runs awesome and actually works better than most I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>else I love the shaver.</li>
            <li>Yes, I was able to use it for my head as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The BRAUN CRUZER 6 FACE SHAVER does everything it promises, and even more.</li>
            <li>However, one thing: if you are buying this for your boyfriend/husband, make SURE he likes electric razors.</li>
            <li>The BRAUN CRUZER 6 FACE SHAVER does everything it promises, and even more.</li>
            <li>However, one thing: if you are buying this for your boyfriend/husband, make SURE he likes electric razors.</li>
            <li>I think since it does so many things.</li>
            <li>But, they decided to load up the package with cheapo plastic guides and this hood type structure to make it more of a \\&quot;multi-use\\&quot; face shaver.  </li>
            <li>I have used Braun shavers for many years.</li>
            <li>As for the trimming capability, a dedicated trimmer would be a much better proposition.</li>
            <li>He has been a Braun fan for years and had this razor for many years before he dropped and broke it.  </li>
            <li>realize that the foil shaver can&#x27;t be as thorough as the sophisticated Series 7 shaver</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does seem to do better under the shower.</li>
            <li>I love Braun products and needed a trimmer that can also do my neck and cheeks.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>That being said, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re out there, but they&#x27;re not going to be in this price</li>
            <li>I have been using the Braun Cruzer for more than 5 years.</li>
            <li>It took many passes for the hair to be removed and</li>
            <li>Still, it is faster than the water and foam method, so I use it most days.</li>
            <li>The shaver is ok - takes longer than a razor and gel and is not as close</li>
            <li>The adjustable length options for the shaver top are where I ran into issues.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terrible - just not my cup of tea.</li>
            <li>on my neck it seems to miss more.</li>
            <li>I am fairly satisfied with the razor, but I have a softer, light-colored beard.  </li>
            <li>I really like being able to shave in the shower and it has great battery life but</li>
            <li>Its an OK razor for trimming and what not</li>
            <li>/&gt;The best part about the Cruzer is that it did not irritate my skin, and I made several passes because the shaver needed time to get all the longer hairs.</li>
            <li>The series 7 is more box like in shape.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I really love this shaver, it meets all my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ive been using shavers for four years and most have had problems after a couple months of use despite my attempt to maintain them.</li>
            <li>Love this razor, I&#x27;ve had the cruiser 3 before.</li>
            <li>wish that it had a couple more &#x27;length options&#x27; for trimming my beard.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, my opinion: The Braun Cruzer is worth the investment and is a good shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better than Philips.</li>
            <li>it was much better than this junk.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much better than this...</li>
            <li>Thru the years, I have used many shavers and beard trimmers.</li>
            <li>I would have been happier ordering Braun&#x27;s head and beard trimmer instead since it allows more length settings and has much much more battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are probably better out there though.</li>
            <li>favorite electric razor</li>
            <li>this should be the end of the cruzers series , Avoid avoid avoid , for $30 u can get a better shaver and save yourself some bucks.</li>
            <li>This product does a lot of things really well, but does not do any one thing great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s also able to be used in the shower.</li>
            <li>We are returning this razor for a better model.  </li>
            <li>Very unique idea of combining so many shaving features.</li>
            <li>The trimmer on the other hand is amazing, and the best you can find for the price.</li>
            <li>The attachments work nicely and cleanly.  </li>
            <li>though is pretty good.</li>
            <li>- The battery life is pretty good...</li>
            <li>I guess this is pretty good</li>
            <li>It charges quickly and looks nice, but it has lots of attachments.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and charges nicely.  </li>
            <li>- The close shave portion (grill area) is great for the chin, upper lip, and cheek areas and gives a nice, close shave&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it , very cool , strong , powerful&lt;br</li>
            <li>guard is very comfortable, the cut is accurate.  </li>
            <li>It works fine, the shaver could be better, but it is what you should expect for this price.</li>
            <li>Overall, very good versatile razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy about Braun shaving products so far.</li>
            <li>I bought this primarily for the trimmer aspect of it, which works OK.  </li>
            <li>liked the Cruzer 6 better than the Cruzer 5, because it seemed to operate at a higher seed (inside motor seemed to rotate faster), although it is a bit louder than a Philips/Norelco that I stopped using altogether.  </li>
            <li>Effectively, shaver part will be rarely used by me.</li>
            <li>The perfect gift for the bearded one or the guy who can&#x27;t decide and sometimes sports a whisker or two and other times goes smoothed faced.  </li>
            <li>After 3 days, I was able to do a clean shave within 2 minutes and my face looks as if I used a razor to shave.</li>
            <li>The Cruzer 6  came with a charging stand and can also be charged just with the power cord for easy travel--</li>
            <li>/&gt;Braun does not make it easy to contact the company.  </li>
            <li>It does not seem to easily trim the hair with length that i want.</li>
            <li>like than you don&#x27;t get a clean shave, but for all than like looks a 3 day beard, is ok</li>
            <li>Easy to maintain.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>I like it a lot is easy and I going to get another one for my son, because he keeps taking mine.</li>
            <li>Of course nothing works better than a razor for a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>Some guys just cant get used to holding the electric razors at perfect right angles to their face, or their hair doesnt cut as well with these, as with regular razor blades.</li>
            <li>Some guys just cant get used to holding the electric razors at perfect right angles to their face, or their hair doesnt cut as well with these, as with regular razor blades.</li>
            <li>The rotatable, retractable trimmer still works beautifully after several months of ownership, and use in and out of the shower</li>
            <li>I do charge it a couple times a week probably as it shaves better with a full charge, but battery life is not a drawback to me.</li>
            <li>This is good for me because I live in a dorm</li>
            <li>this will work fine.</li>
            <li>Still works fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Simple, fabulous and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As all Braun machines, this worked fine for me</li>
            <li>The various guards make beard trimming easy and the twistable trimmer is great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a handy little device and great for traveling....</li>
            <li>Waterproof is a huge plus, really easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer feature on this unit, however, is FANTASTIC; uniform trimming and shaping every time.</li>
            <li>He likes that it is light and ergonomically designed.  </li>
            <li>when you switch the combs between 1-2-3 it slips from 2-3 or 1-2... and over time it is just not useable because it now runs free</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine there would be all these great reviews if people were having the same experience I did.  </li>
            <li>You can also clean it easily with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No tugging and pulling as I experienced with my last</li>
            <li>It feels great in your hand and it&#x27;s a lot smaller than competitive products.</li>
            <li>As smooth as it gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: It is a fantastic electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: It is a fantastic electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great tool to shape facial hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean, just run under water.</li>
            <li>It is light weight and feels like someone designed it to fit in my hand.</li>
            <li>It is not that fantastic</li>
            <li>then I can attest that it will do a great overall job.</li>
            <li>Easy clean with water proof.</li>
            <li>I primarily use it to maintain a stubble length</li>
            <li>It makes my skin smooth as if I shaved with a razor in almost all spots on my face.</li>
            <li>Having purchased Braun products before, I was surprised as their quality is usually so good.</li>
            <li>It is perfect to keep a 2/3 days beard thanks to its extra tools.</li>
            <li>I wear a goatee and this trimmer helps keep my old gray whiskers looking good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is quite good at simply shaving your face clean, but then again most electric razors can do that as well.  </li>
            <li>Since the trimmers were the primary reason I got the razor in the first place, I&#x27;m well satisfied with this aspect of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a great product for the price as long as you grow a light beard.</li>
            <li>Good shaver, not as close a shave as my old braun with dual shaving heads but good enough for the price.</li>
            <li>I have found it works best if I use shaving cream, and that&#x27;s a feature not many foil shavers have.</li>
            <li>It is waterproof, so you can rinse it clean, or even use it in the shower.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think you will ever achieve a clean shave with this product.</li>
            <li>I bought this braun shaver; however, i didn&#x27;t like its clean shave.</li>
            <li>If you need it for clean shave, I think you must go for another one.</li>
            <li>Buy a trimmer instead and use something else to clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>clean shave some areas</li>
            <li>If you are buying this and planning on using it to shave clean, look somewhere else.  </li>
            <li>Shaving cleanly?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve kept mine in great shape just doing a dry clean after every use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I cant get a clean shave with.</li>
            <li>More importantly it gives you a very close shave.</li>
            <li>It has almost everything you need to any style from a clean shave to a stubble or goatee.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly similar to my first, which I liked, with some nice improvements  or enhancements.  </li>
            <li>I probably would&#x27;ve stuck with my normal shaver as it does a better clean shave, for people who like to have a trimmed or light shave look</li>
            <li>Fortunately I fit that category and enjoy this product very much.</li>
            <li>Good shaver, great trimming tools, works great on thick dark hair, and the fact that its waterproof is a plus!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great on trimming between eye brows with 1 mm trimmer, and the 28mm wide trimmer for side burns.</li>
            <li>All in all, a good product that I now use regularly.</li>
            <li>But for me even when I use it before my whiskers have more than 1/32 of an inch growth it still doesn&#x27;t shave very well</li>
            <li>FOr example, if you want that 3 day stubble look, you&#x27;d never be able to get that with a straight razor, without waiting 3 days after you shave.</li>
            <li>I must say that its trimmers are good enough.</li>
            <li>It turns the intended trimming/shaping operation into the need for a full shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve always had better luck with blades, but sometimes having an electric shaver is very convenient.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really comment on the foil aspect of it, but I ran it across my face and it was comfortable!</li>
            <li>One notable design feature is that the shaving surface is extra-wide; very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Braun, however, succeeds at failing in every respect possible.  </li>
            <li>I dont know why it has such good reviews.</li>
            <li>I still really like the Braun for it&#x27;s trimming combs, does much better on my goatee than my Wahl clippers, so for that alone</li>
            <li>So if you need your whole face shaven every day, the series 7 does better at shaving under the neck.</li>
            <li>Overall good buy.</li>
            <li>So, I am wondering whether only trimmer would have been good enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is OK with me because I use just one level on my whole beard and I like it.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use the beard grooming attachments, but they appear \\&quot;cool and trendy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>There could be some more beard length options, but really what is has is adequate.  </li>
            <li>There are two different sizes of trimmer built in to the razor itself, and that alone makes this a very attractive choice for a razor to take with you on the road, or to be able to use without having to fetch a bunch of other accessories, etc.</li>
            <li>I received an apology email right away, they confirmed my mailing address, and said the mailing label and instructions would be sent immediately.  </li>
            <li>The number of accessories are a bit daunting and it took me a few tries with the trimmer attachments to figure out what settings are best for me, but overall, an excellent product.</li>
            <li>, it is a joy to use both, but if you want something other than those two options is not your machine</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the third electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned, and I&#x27;m very impressed with its overall performance and versatility.</li>
            <li>Adequate range of lengths too.</li>
            <li>It takes about two minutes for the quick charge.</li>
            <li>Quick fix with super glue and</li>
            <li>The only real con i experienced was at the beginning.</li>
            <li>The Braun Cruzer is the most comfortable shaver I&#x27;ve used so far.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product for trimming sideburns, neatening up beards or 5 o&#x27;clock shadows, etc., but it&#x27;s an absolute nightmare to use for an actual shave.</li>
            <li>It is acceptable for quick shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and then you will achieve a perfect result.&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is a bit short, because everytime you shave you have to charge it or sometimes at the middle of the shaving process</li>
            <li>Works best for the hair right under my nose, which is sometimes hard to reach with a razor.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good at trimming beards and straightening up your sideburns, mustaches, etc, but it&#x27;s not good at getting you as nice, clean shave.</li>
            <li>the other heads are very handy.</li>
            <li>Probably okay for light duty or weekend use but not part of my regular line-up when being clean-shaven is important.</li>
            <li>The trimmer gets close and is fairly comfortable to use (also easier than the higher end ones I use because it slides up instead of out</li>
            <li>This unit is particularly useful if you have a full beard, as the trimmers have comb attachments for beard trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve worn beards several times over the years, but never had such a nice tool for keeping them looking good.</li>
            <li>I love the new precision comb that use for eyebrow</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it charges very quickly, unlike my Norelco grooming shaver that I had that would take a whole day to charge.</li>
            <li>I suppose that if you shaved every day or don&#x27;t let the whiskers get more than 1/32 of an inch long then it might shave better.</li>
            <li>Very compact and easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s really easy to use and very precise.&lt;br</li>
            <li>product does exactly what I want it to do!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to people interested in using an electric shaver!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave anywhere near as comfortable as the 7-9 series but it&#x27;s manageable and easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to hold shaver at 90&#x27;angle, then you will get a real close shave without a burn.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for shaving everyday.</li>
            <li>Thus far I have only used it a couple of times, but am impressed so far.</li>
            <li>That said, if you already use electric, this is a nice product with no obvious drawbacks to me.</li>
            <li>His old clippers that he&#x27;s had for years is able to give a closer shave than this.</li>
            <li>Initially, I thought that maybe you need a heap of hair to use this shaver effectively</li>
            <li>-Lightweight, easy to grip  -cordless with decent battery life  </li>
            <li>I actually own a Series 7 Braun shaver and bought this Cruzer only as a \\&quot;travel shaver\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used an electric in many years, but the same basic problem remains - they don&#x27;t really do a good job of shaving closely.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth having.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly compact for travel and is great for maintaining face, mustache and beard because of the various trimmer and shaver options - no need for several different trimmers - this one does it all.  </li>
            <li>however does a far better job of maintaining a goatee.</li>
            <li>We never took it out of the box after he made his wishes more clear.</li>
            <li>One man&#x27;s opinion, and your mileage may vary, but I can say with the utmost certainty that I won&#x27;t be using a razor any more, and I&#x27;m glad I saved roughly $100 by skipping the higher priced offerings.</li>
            <li>just those two trimmers do pretty much everything I need, and I could almost see paying a fair sum for a device that did only what the two trimmers do.</li>
            <li>and I always loved having a sharp square goatee.</li>
            <li>right time</li>
            <li>Stuck between a 2 and 3 star rating right now.  </li>
            <li>I want to do it right.</li>
            <li>This is handy if you just want to take one tool for travel trimming, but it is pretty flimsy and doesn&#x27;t stand up to daily use.</li>
            <li>Fast trim, precision cut, and a clean stubble look.</li>
            <li>I bought it primarily as a goatee/mustache trimmer as I use a razor for normal shaving, however I&#x27;ve used it for close shaving as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seemed like a great idea to get a combination shaver/trimmer that has a slick design and manufactured by Braun.</li>
            <li>And now I find myself with an adjustable trimmer that doesn&#x27;t adjust and an electric shaver that&#x27;s barely qualified to touch any of our lovely faces.</li>
            <li>Quiet, powerful, and very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>battery life is good for a shaver, at half an hour between charges.</li>
            <li>The head has a bit of a spring action to it, allowing you to get a really close shave and pain free!  </li>
            <li>If yours are more stiff and you like using electric razors, this is an exceptional product that you will enjoy for a long time.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t have very much stubble</li>
            <li>It must be a defect in the design since I&#x27;ve been very gentle with my unit.</li>
            <li>to use and is very gentle on skin.</li>
            <li>Not the most gentle, but good for harder to trim areas and actually works.  </li>
            <li>Very nice results when used as trimmer, using it for shaving not much you can only get nice results when used after regular blates</li>
            <li>The plastic piece that pops out for trimming broke within the first week.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty versatile product.  </li>
            <li>When my wife first put the shaver on my lap</li>
            <li>negatives, however, keep me from rating this product higher.</li>
            <li>First, as a shaver the Cruzer leaves a lot to be desired.</li>
            <li>my last braun shaver I could go for 24 hours or more between shaves.</li>
            <li>at first i thought it was because my skin needed time to get used to it</li>
            <li>but after the first month it was still not shaving properly.&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li>braun is my first face shaver from braun  </li>
            <li>tried to use the razor on my legs first and it didn&#x27;t cut any hair off at all.  </li>
            <li>First, the face shaver, that works like all electric shavers have since they&#x27;ve been around.</li>
            <li>Regarding shaving performance, it is only okay.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d suggest getting a higher end model.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not the most quiet shaver out there by any means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Alright so got the product in yesterday and today decided to use it for the first time.</li>
            <li>First of all, if I skip shaving for a day, this won&#x27;t get the job done</li>
            <li>The trimmers work pretty well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I recommend it as a first electric razor.</li>
            <li>I had one of the first generation Cruzer razors and accidentally dropped it while on a trip and the rotating trimmer broke off</li>
            <li>Plan to do that often, because the foil shaver won&#x27;t work without first plowing over your face with the trimmer.</li>
            <li>I had some adjustment to getting use to this shaver at first.</li>
            <li>Because my hair is shaved in the neck now, I believe daily usage will do a better job at getting all of them.</li>
            <li>Because my hair is short, I think it will work much better</li>
            <li>On those occasions I attack the whiskers first with the trimmer, then go over everything again with the shaving head.</li>
            <li>First, my qualifications: I&#x27;m a man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Economical price, found as described and fast</li>
            <li>/&gt;Strongly recommended, will deal again in future for sure.</li>
            <li>get me wrong, trimmer is excellent and I do not mind the option of having an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>But thought of sharing with the next &#x27;stubble&#x27; person who looks at this one! :)</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty light-weight.</li>
            <li>Beard trimming is mediocre at best.  </li>
            <li>This product was made for young guys (in their 20&#x27;s) with light beards.</li>
            <li>If I was able to grow enough of a beard to use these attachments, I doubt the trimmer would meet my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>while the shaver itself could be a little more effective, I suspect this is partly a function of the limits of electric razors in general.</li>
            <li>In summary, while the shaver itself could be a little more effective, I suspect this is partly a function of the limits of electric razors in general.</li>
            <li>and I also loved some of the features to do things like trim sideburns because my 4 year old son often needs his hair trimmed up on the back of his neck and around the sideburn area before he really needs a whole</li>
            <li>It also does a nice job of maintaining cheek and neck lines looking sharp.  </li>
            <li>I do not use this machine as much as a lot of people because i cannot grow a full beard yet, but it is incredibly good to clean my face and keep all my facial hair at one level so it wont look messy.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made, doesn&#x27;t give close shave, and makes a mess unlike the vacuum kind.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very comfortable to use on my face both wet and dry and is very easy to clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First, the Cruzer comes with a built-in rechargeable battery that is ready to go out of the box.</li>
            <li>It misses many hairs on my neck and leaves them long.</li>
            <li>The narrow trimmer is great for trimming a mustache along the lip line or other fine work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hesitant to use it in the shower only because it&#x27;s electric and that kind of stuff freaks me out, but apparently it&#x27;s do-able!</li>
            <li>The notches on the guard that allow you to select the beard length wear out very easily and now mine won&#x27;t stay on any setting other than the shortest.  </li>
            <li>My face is super sensitive to razors.</li>
            <li>This model is a bit sleeker and there are no problems with its ability to function purely as a shaver.</li>
            <li>far as designing a good combo shaver/trimmer razor, the folks at Braun are half way there.</li>
            <li>Every once in a while they may need a nice, soft, dry brush.</li>
            <li>I had to go over the same spot more than 5 times to get it completely shaved!</li>
            <li>Thanks for that it awsome</li>
            <li>thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li>The Shaver really met my expectations!&lt;br /&gt;So</li>
            <li>Procter &amp; Gamble really dropped the ball on this product..</li>
            <li>The way the two trimmers can be swiveled and slid into place is very convenient.  </li>
            <li>The trimmers work much better than the shaver - be careful as you learn to use it.</li>
            <li>it does not cut real close.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t just because it wasn&#x27;t really indended for that</li>
            <li>Again, it didn&#x27;t really cut any hair off.  </li>
            <li>This BRAUN shaver kit really DOES come with everything...</li>
            <li>charges fast, and comes with a charging stand.  </li>
            <li>It does provide a smooth shave, but you have to work at it a bit, especially with my course</li>
            <li>It does this very well.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m able, I will amend this with my findings while wet shaving with  the Braun Cruzer 6.</li>
            <li>Very</li>
            <li>His dad had no issues though he much prefers his [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt to shave though, just isn&#x27;t extremely fast for me.</li>
            <li>Since I have a goatee this is quite an improvement over anything else I used before, and much easier than getting out my Wahl clippers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very close shave on my face but</li>
            <li>I really like the Braun product line and this shaver</li>
            <li>likes that it is lightweight, yet very efficient.</li>
            <li>It works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A responsible company would have immediately shipped me a replacement attachment at no cost.  </li>
            <li>and I decided to find something that worked no matter how much it cost me.</li>
            <li>I attribute its better performance under my chin to the center cutter that is positioned between the two foil cutters.</li>
            <li>Works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>I really like this shaver</li>
            <li>It shaves close without irritation and ttrimmer works very well with my beard.  </li>
            <li>With this product I can get it really close, but it just takes a lot of passes.  </li>
            <li>It holds a charge very well.  </li>
            <li>In my experience I had to spend nearly 20 minutes making pass after pass from as many different angles as I could.</li>
            <li>I bought the Andis T outliner, and it worked great for a trim, but it was never accurate enough to give me the sharpness I was looking for around my chin, and using that thing to shave my neck area was a nightmare.</li>
            <li>it works good as new but it wasn&#x27;t a long enough fall to do damage.</li>
            <li>The big problem is that it&#x27;s not very powerful and does not do a good job of shaving.</li>
            <li>Really, how much better can it be than other shavers?  </li>
            <li>far up to now, it didn&#x27;t let me down for sure!</li>
            <li>It will cut thick hair, but for a clean controlled cut, you can do better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a weakness of the Cruzer6 so much as it is a weakness of the foiled-electric-shaver design generally; just know that you won&#x27;t be able to let yourself go for a week, then get clean-shaven, using only this device (or ANY electric shaver)-</li>
            <li>but I simply can&#x27;t recommend this Cruzer because half of what it purports to do--arguably the more important half--it doesn&#x27;t really do.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s not a mess of attachments to clutter my bathroom up with and that everything is right there on the razor.</li>
            <li>The other reviews are great, even from women using it to cut the hair on their legs and other non-intended uses.  </li>
            <li>The foil shaver isn&#x27;t as smooth as Braun&#x27;s higher models but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s waterproof, it&#x27;s easy to clean, it sits in a recharging base, the foil can be replaced (though I don&#x27;t know about the trimmer head), and most importantly is comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Not only does that little Cruzer 6 shave closer, but it is more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>It is cheaply made and takes twice as long to save with this shaver</li>
            <li>: It is an electric razor.t that you will enjoy for a long time.</li>
            <li>A full charge will net you 30 minutes of shaving.</li>
            <li>After a full days growth this trimmer performs moderately well but nowhere close to shaving with a razor.</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t get a full sweeping stroke, such as under the nose, because of the shape of the guard.  </li>
            <li>This is the first electric razor that I have ever used and so far I think I like it.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I could prevent this by just charging the shaver once a week (only takes about 15 min for a full charge).</li>
            <li>and I ultimately had to use a normal, non-electric razor to get a clean shave after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After reading some of the negative reviews I was a little hesitant to purchase the newer Cruzer, but I&#x27;ve been very happy with it!  </li>
            <li>(proves that it&#x27;s just hard to do more than one thing well)</li>
            <li>Overall, dry shaving with either of those two is good enough for me, and my four year old daughter, who has become my beard tester, pretty much says daddy doesn&#x27;t need a shave afterwords.  </li>
            <li>The Cruzer is smaller,feels better in my hand, and easier to handle along the jaw line and under the nose, and costs a lot less than the Braun Series 7 Pulsonic and the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>The results with that shaver are similar to my experience with the newer Cruzer - okay in a pinch or for the weekend but definitely not the replacement to razor</li>
            <li>This is a decent shaver if you want a close shave.</li>
            <li>The main benefit is the goatee/ mustache trimmer.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m making do with an older one I still have.    </li>
            <li>Similar the Cruzer 5, the Cruzer 6 seems also to suffer from the \\&quot;needing to go over your face many times\\&quot; to get all the hairs syndrome, but it does not leave the red bumps like the Philips 2D model I used just once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After two days of giving it a go, he went back to his more traditional Braun shaver.</li>
            <li>the older</li>
            <li>the beard comb attachment (the larger attachment with blue colored comb), which is the one I used most often broke.  </li>
            <li>Most of the beard trimmers I found weren&#x27;t deep enough to maintain a beard.</li>
            <li>After seeing really decent reviews I was convinced to buy this shaver.</li>
            <li>However, if a decent one is all you&#x27;re looking for, then go for it rather than a $10-20 one.</li>
            <li>I have took this product mainly for shaving ,after using</li>
            <li>I felt that attachments will convert main blade into a trimmer and if you remove attachments, it will become a shaver.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d just like to point out that it is highly unlike myself to sit here and write about a product</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It comes highly recommended from my husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed other reviewers mention that the foiled shaver itself isn&#x27;t quite as effective as they&#x27;d like, and I have to second this.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use it on my face every time—I will NOT have my pits look like a prickly, irritated wasteland or Cthulhu&#x27;s mustache after a run-in an overheated flat iron— but it should be more solidly built than this.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s also a clear plastic clip, for the large (face) shaving head.</li>
            <li>Now I rated this four stars because when I was finished the shave was very close and even though I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The foil trimmer he has complained about and to be honest</li>
            <li>Oh, well, I&#x27;ve kept the box and will be able to send it back when it refuses to charge at all, which I suspect won&#x27;t be long.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s pretty unrealistic to buy an electric shaver and expect a shave as good as a razor.</li>
            <li>If I let mine grow for more than about three days, this has trouble with it.</li>
            <li>I had this a few months and love it.  </li>
            <li>Just missing more levels for the trim.</li>
            <li>However, only smaller blades on top of the product act as trimmers while attachments completely cover its shaver part.</li>
            <li>sure if I made a mistake in understanding usage or was the description not clear enough on the site.</li>
            <li>But overall it would be worth it if it lasts.</li>
            <li>It has only the one snap on head to trim to a even length that&#x27;s just right for my mustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And I am playing with blades right next to my throat right?&lt;br</li>
            <li>It can do a quick charge though, and doesn&#x27;t take too long to fully charge.</li>
            <li>While this shaver has some nice features and has multiple applications, it did a poor job when it came to a clean shave.</li>
            <li>the price it can do many different things, such as generally shaving my face and neck, trimming my beard, and keeping my sideburns nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband loves his new shaver.  </li>
            <li>, I have had time to use my new Series 7, 790 braun shaver that just came in.</li>
            <li>Please live up to Braun&#x27;s name.</li>
            <li>I like it, and will continue to use it when I want a quick dry shave.</li>
            <li>The top popped off a few times when using it near my chin and jaw line.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, the larger trimmer was accurate enough and the smaller trimmer on the flipside was put the dots on the I and crosses the T.</li>
            <li>But before you order, be very clear about why you are ordering it.</li>
            <li>He does not like that it is very loud, and he says it does not give a good shave if you let your facial hair get very long -- in other words, if he doesn&#x27;t shave every day, it does not work well.  </li>
            <li>so I look a little older, which is important for my job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As with most other Braun items we have used, the device is fully made in Germany with the only power cord originating in China.</li>
            <li>Seems better than other similar products.</li>
            <li>you wish, just use the blue clip, and the snap up shaver, and you can get that very short hair look, and also clean up around the neck, etc.</li>
            <li>so I use my other Braun shaver for totally clean shave.</li>
            <li>The adjustment button, free spirit that it is, then flew right down the drain after being sandwiched between the two other parts instead of more firmly connected to either.</li>
            <li>It takes a very short time for recharging and it is very powerful and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li>Upon trying the old one again while the new one was recharging, i realized it was hurting my face and didn&#x27;t give me anywhere near as close a shave as The Braun Cruzer 6.   </li>
            <li>My problem came when innocent me thought that it is so fashionable now that we&#x27;re both men, the beard of three days two slightly trimmed, which allows us to not shave daily but not go</li>
            <li>I am guilt free when I shave my neck now, and having a square goatee that is clean and sharp everyday is dreamy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does a much better job when I use it every day or every other day when my beard isn&#x27;t as long.</li>
            <li>Okay I read the reviews, nearly all of them, starting with the negative then moving to the positive.</li>
            <li>-The length guide for the trimmer greatly reduces the effectiveness of the cutting</li>
            <li>The Cruzer itself seems sturdy and not too light or too heavy in hand.</li>
            <li>One trimmer is built into the back of the unit and swivels making some trimming jobs much easier than contorting your hand or wrist.</li>
            <li>And using the trimmer head to shorten them enough so that the foil will shave them doesn&#x27;t work very well either.</li>
            <li>As far as it&#x27;s performance...</li>
            <li>Braun&#x27;s website lists a part number for it, but they do not sell their parts directly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using my 5 year old series 3 380.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I can see what i&#x27;m doing), I don&#x27;t use the smaller one too much.</li>
            <li>the Cruzer 6 is surprisingly loud</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, I think this shaver was either designed by someone who has no concept of what hair is, or, it&#x27;s meant for those baby-faced Swedish boy models you see in Ralph Lauren ads that have 3 soft baby hairs on their chin that they&#x27;ve never cut.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll have to use the old fashioned, disposable, 4-blade razor to touch up after it.</li>
            <li>The young one in  </li>
            <li>They trim close and have given no nicks so far.  </li>
            <li>So far, the 3-head has been the answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Instead, I&#x27;m nearly three months without the use of the razor.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Please do not waste your time ordering and returning this</li>
            <li>and this shaver has had no trouble dealing with it.  </li>
            <li>I suffer from sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Mid size shaver, it charges fast and easy.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>- The trimmer cuts through days/weeks old growth with no trouble, and doesn&#x27;t nick or cut my face</li>
            <li>This shaver has many pros and only a few cons.</li>
            <li>Not perfect but really good.</li>
            <li>The trimming tools are very handy especially when trying to clean up unwanted body hair, however, I was a little disappointed with the performance of the shaving head when set for a clean shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m low-maintenance when it comes to shaving the face these days; I largely let it grow and only shave my face clean once every few weeks, trimming and &#x27;cleaning up&#x27; the rest of the time</li>
            <li>In fact, even tho you get a plain blue cardboard box to keep these barber supplies together, you will probibly want to buy a more durable plastic box.</li>
            <li>Its all but nessacary for beard grooming, tho, unless you want to play around with scissors for an hour.ou get a plain blue cardboard box to keep these barber supplies together, you will probibly want to buy a more durable plastic box.</li>
            <li>Shaving dry, the Panasonic is slightly, but noticeably, better than the Braun Series 7.  </li>
            <li>This is the only reason I&#x27;m still using it and haven&#x27;t gleefully thrown it off a high building in order to joyfully observe it smash into thousands of unusable pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought it with high expectations, and the $70-ish price reinforced those expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, for a product with such versatility, there are no usable instructions.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t use it to actually shave my face with, since I prefer using a non-electric razor on my face since I have real sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a small, light, well-designed unit.  </li>
            <li>I bought this hoping it would live up to half of the things it says it does and after having it a few weeks, some of them are better than others.  </li>
            <li>With the disposable razor I can get a lot closer shave in a lot less time so the electric foil shaver just isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>The only thing he says is on his wish list is a meter to show how much charge is left.</li>
            <li>Instructions are the same for different models, and don&#x27;t really explain what each piece should be used</li>
            <li>As a shaver, it works no better or worse than the average foil shaver, which is good enough for most men who shave every day.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and regularly draw blood with a razor because of it.</li>
            <li>the family prefers it for grooming his facial fuzz rather than taking it down to a full shave.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been skeptical of electric shavers since first having tried them many years ago with a different Braun foil shaver.</li>
            <li>You continually have to go over the same area multiple times from different directions and with all the other electric shavers I&#x27;ve had I&#x27;ve only usually needed to go twice against the grain to get a great shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to cut down a grown-out beard before wet shaving or to shape up an outline.  </li>
            <li>for cleaning, you can usually blow the blades clean after removing the blade screen.</li>
            <li>This cruzer does a decent enough job shaving that I think I may send the 790 back, but I don&#x27;t know, we will see when I test it.</li>
            <li>When I don&#x27;t shave for two or more days, the whiskers are too tough for the shaving head to handle without discomfort.</li>
            <li>I keep my neck clean shaven and here is where this product is only slightly above average.  </li>
            <li>Bought it as a replacement for my last Cruzer 6 after it died of old age.</li>
            <li>He have shaved completely as well as played with different types of beard styles.  </li>
            <li>After I received this razor, I went to check reviews to see if others were having the same issues I am and was surprised to see that, no, they weren&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty average.</li>
            <li>would only recommend this to a 15 year old.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say my beard is pretty average.  </li>
            <li>Even on days of regular use I have to constantly go over an area at different angles to get it to cut reasonably well.</li>
            <li>As far as the cheeks, chin, and mouth area, for me they perform the same.</li>
            <li>, this machine is not for that, is to shave completely and not leave even one hair on the face, or to adecuarte or recortarte a dense beard, no stubble rather serves only to a beard of weeks .&lt;br</li>
            <li>the smaller trimmer was an unexpected surprise as well.</li>
            <li>It only offers 4 guard levels for beard trimming.  </li>
            <li>The cruzer is also smaller and therefor is better for targeting specific areas, such as if you want a square mustache and you need to trim a line just underneath the nose with the shave, this is possible with the cruser because of its narrow rectangular foil.</li>
            <li>However, it didn&#x27;t shave as close as the old traditional razor and shaving cream, and I found it a bit more irritating on the skin too.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is ok with trimming your beard, but it is poor at face shaving.</li>
            <li>Compared to my husband&#x27;s other shaver, it covered a much smaller area of the face and required multiple times going over the same area to get a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>Cruzer 6 also has a very useful charging stand (and small clear plastic shaving guard); however, other than that, these two Braun razors seem nearly identical.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this because of other Braun products that I owned had worked really well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this a few months now (from Vine, obviously), and I pretty much gave up using it as a shaver after the second try; it just left too much of a mess behind on my face, and I&#x27;m fairly certain I could&#x27;ve moved it around my face for a good hour and little visible difference from my pre-shave condition.</li>
            <li>Although I have not had a chance to use the Cruzer wet shaving, I did find that the Panasonic, with a little soap (I use a bit of shampoo because it&#x27;s slicker) is definitely better than dry shaving.</li>
            <li>My big question, was if I could also use it on my hair, cos I like short, nearly shaved hair on my head.</li>
            <li>- The grill area does poorly in the neck area, especially with hair that is 2 days or more in length.</li>
            <li>but they must have had the mane of a unicorn because this isn&#x27;t good at cutting facial hair at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a decent shaver that wouldn&#x27;t empty my wallet.  </li>
            <li>but, took a little getting use to at first.</li>
            <li>Took far too long to finish shaving.</li>
            <li>i have had this shaver for a few month now and it is pretty aweful.</li>
            <li>this machine is not for guys with full thick beards.&lt;br</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Comfortable shave with minimal tug &amp; pull, but not very effective razor.  </li>
            <li>and I really couldn&#x27;t rate it down if I wasn&#x27;t using it as intended.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, it is worth mentioning a word or two about shaving wet with either the Panasonic or the Braun Cruzer (the more expensive Braun Pulsonic cannot be used wet).  </li>
            <li>It pinched my skin and would cut me from time to time, also too much Andis was no better than using a razor because it irritated my skin in the neck area from frequent usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact and has a quick charge feature that let&#x27;s you finish shaving if the unit loses it&#x27;s charge before you&#x27;re finished.</li>
            <li>a very poor shaving machine that u will need to clean ur face with a razor after using it, push it as much as u can to ur face and it will still leave those greeny hair all over ur face , my advice Dont buy it</li>
            <li>If you just want to put the beard and mustache attachments aside and use it for a straight razor when the wife has laid down the law and the facial hair had to go...</li>
            <li>So I end up trimming part of my beard (which is what I bought it for), and using normal shaving blades to shave the other part.</li>
            <li>It was super delicate to my skin and its a shaver that I can use daily now.</li>
            <li>So, Unless you desire a combined shaver/ trimmer, pass on this one and buy a less expensive model shaver and a more capable trimmer.</li>
            <li>They do not offer much adjustment leaving no options for replacing a Wahl trimmer for short tight hair cuts.  </li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve ever used an electric shaver, it took me a few shaves to get the technique to get a clean shave without irritating my skin.</li>

            <li> Also the product itself looks really good!</li>
            <li> The design is beautiful.</li>
            <li> The trimming parts of this razor work great.</li>
            <li> Great for detailing.</li>
            <li> Would make a great travel razor</li>
            <li> I looked on Amazon.com, found the razor and my husband was a happy camper when he opened up his package on Christmas morning.</li>
            <li> The adjustable guard feels flimsy when you move it, but it holds great when you trimming.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The product does great for pubic regions with the adjustable trimmer.</li>
            <li> Great shaver.</li>
            <li> Great attachments.</li>
            <li> When used as a trimmer for the \\&quot;scruffy\\&quot; look, this is a great shaver.  </li>
            <li> Great choice.</li>
            <li> So, I give it 4 stars to say that \\&quot;I like it\\&quot;, but still lacks great value and quality.  </li>
            <li> great add-on.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job of trimmer my beard to keep the length where I want it.  </li>
            <li> The foil works great around the ears.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use the beard atachments, but the shaver is a great value with all the features it does have.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what is so great about this shaver...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I bought the Cruzer Face 6.</li>
            <li> For the price and performance seemed to read me a great machine.</li>
            <li> this shaver works great for years, I broke trimmer part and can not find replacement part so use rubber band to hold it on while trimming beard.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works great.</li>
            <li> The Beard and mustache trimmer are Great.</li>
            <li> Therefore I have used the adjustable beard trimmer with great satisfaction.</li>
            <li> There are more attachments and gizmos here, to get your beard to be perfectly groomed, than you can imagine.</li>
            <li> I think its OK, not the best though.</li>
            <li> Great shaver and a good price.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with this shaver and enjoy using it!</li>
            <li> so it wasn&#x27;t a pleasant experience while this was happening.</li>
            <li> It gave me a good close shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been told that your skin needs to get used to the shaver in order to get a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a good priced shaver, this is the one.</li>
            <li> Good price too.</li>
            <li> The lack of holder spaces for the attachments is not so good, so I have deducted a star for that.  </li>
            <li> Has nice attachments and looks great.</li>
            <li> it is really good and shaving good  </li>
            <li> It is gorgeous.</li>
            <li> So its a good foil shaver- if you are looking for that, its in the mix.  </li>
            <li> The Good:  </li>
            <li> Good for a trimmer, that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> This is a good, versatile, electric razor/trimmer.  </li>
            <li> seller is good too</li>
            <li> It feels good.  </li>
            <li> razor portion is about as good as I could expect.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Build quality is extremely good.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Would recommend to anyone looking for a good quality mustash &amp; beard trimmer&lt;</li>
            <li> Holds a good charge.</li>
            <li> son called me the day after Christmas to proudly tell me he was all trimmed up and really liked it.</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s a really good shaver.  </li>
            <li> No electric will get as close as the blade, but this does a good job in between.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> The shaver however, did not do as good a job as a razor edge, but it did get 95% of all the hairs, and I used a razor to nick the rest.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, under my chin, the series 7 does a good job of getting I&#x27;d say about 98% of all my hairs.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> Bought this product after reading some good reviews.</li>
            <li> The shaver is excellent for my neck area where I prefer to remain clean shaven and define my beard.</li>
            <li> The trimmers and the length attachment work exceptionally well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazon service was Exceptional.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> So many shavers are just not that great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not overly impressed with the shaver, but the trimmer is the bestI&#x27;ve used for my face so that alone makes this product worth it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very satisfied and the seller shipped the product instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What Braun has here is a good quality (4 star) foil shaver with a nice stand and charging system.  </li>
            <li> It is a handy shaver that fits well in the hand, and it comes with some good trimmer features.  </li>
            <li> My ideal shaver is one that lets me clean my neck and cheeks up, trim up my sideburns and eyebrows, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s a wonderful shaver in it&#x27;s own right.  </li>
            <li> (another feature I love!).  </li>
            <li> You will need a real honest trimmer to handle the tougher full beard and goatee</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t think I could have bought anything better!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The combs included are great, it&#x27;s easy to regulate the length of beard you want to have with</li>
            <li> On a brighter note, I&#x27;ve had to rely on my trusty Gillette Sensor Mach 3, which works wonderfully well and has never let me down.ach 3, which works wonderfully well and has never let me down.</li>
            <li> Really amazing machine.</li>
            <li> Get it with this amazing product.</li>
            <li> also use the foil blade, which again, works great for guys with light beards.</li>
            <li> and kind of let it go.  </li>
            <li> The Braun Cruzer 6 Face is a handy trimmer/shaver, but if you have a course beard, it does take a bit to get a close shave.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice feature.  </li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s nice that I can just run it under water to rinse all of the hairs off of it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Basically, I&#x27;ve never come across any multi-use product that wasn&#x27;t effective at even one of its advertised features.  </li>
            <li> I very much liked the number of attachments it came with and versatility of the shaver.  </li>
            <li> They keep my sideburns nice and trimmed, the way i like them.</li>
            <li> .it works effectively</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for trimming your beard, and the foil shaver gives you a nice close shave on the parts you want smooth.  </li>
            <li> I bought this shaver as a gift for my son and he really liked it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have both in one unit.</li>
            <li> Its nice and does its job well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product with many functions and acessories.</li>
            <li> , it has a nice design</li>
            <li> it is one of the greatest shaving machine i have ever use it is really fabulous specially once i have tried it under the water</li>
            <li> impressive is the fact that it has full waterproof functionality, which means one can use it in the shower, sink-rinse it, etc., which makes it hugely functional.</li>
            <li> Equally impressive is the fact that it has full waterproof functionality, which means one can use it in the shower, sink-rinse it, etc., which makes it hugely functional.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To have the best shave, it&#x27;s better to trim first</li>
            <li> Still going strong and couldn&#x27;t be more happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The razor itself looks cool and runs great.</li>
            <li> I just wish it worked better and more efficiently at getting a good close shave in one or two passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> great item, fantastic to use for the body as well as for the face.&lt;br /&gt;it comes with great tools and it&#x27;s very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;i really recommend this item!</li>
            <li> After using it I&#x27;m sure that it might be great for styling but from the first time i used it it wasn&#x27;t any good for a close shave.</li>
            <li> It is very good for what it does.&lt;br /&gt;Important: battery really lasts and charges fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When used as a close shaver, it may not be the best option for those with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> So far, this works wonderful.</li>
            <li> It had attachments to trim his beard which he found extremely effective &amp; user friendly!</li>
            <li> Good product with many thoughtful features.</li>
            <li> The electric razor is excellent for a quick upkeep on the clean shaven part of my face although I still use blade razor if I want a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> to fast shipping to Turkey, to beautiful machine.</li>
            <li> Still causes light irritation and to get a clean shave it takes a while, will stick with it for a while and see if its the lack of experience from the user or the product just ain&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li> It has held up well and works exceptionally well in some areas and as best as can be expected in others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On a positive note it is great to travel with.  </li>
            <li> It trimmed my goatee very well and did a great job on my body hair.</li>
            <li> Comparable and even better</li>
            <li> He has had just the 3 circle foil razors for years and wanted something that could do more.</li>
            <li> positives of this shaver/trimmer are many.</li>
            <li> trimmer however runs awesome and actually works better than most I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> else I love the shaver.</li>
            <li> Yes, I was able to use it for my head as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The BRAUN CRUZER 6 FACE SHAVER does everything it promises, and even more.</li>
            <li> However, one thing: if you are buying this for your boyfriend/husband, make SURE he likes electric razors.</li>
            <li> The BRAUN CRUZER 6 FACE SHAVER does everything it promises, and even more.</li>
            <li> However, one thing: if you are buying this for your boyfriend/husband, make SURE he likes electric razors.</li>
            <li> I think since it does so many things.</li>
            <li> But, they decided to load up the package with cheapo plastic guides and this hood type structure to make it more of a \\&quot;multi-use\\&quot; face shaver.  </li>
            <li> I have used Braun shavers for many years.</li>
            <li> As for the trimming capability, a dedicated trimmer would be a much better proposition.</li>
            <li> He has been a Braun fan for years and had this razor for many years before he dropped and broke it.  </li>
            <li> realize that the foil shaver can&#x27;t be as thorough as the sophisticated Series 7 shaver</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does seem to do better under the shower.</li>
            <li> I love Braun products and needed a trimmer that can also do my neck and cheeks.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> That being said, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re out there, but they&#x27;re not going to be in this price</li>
            <li> I have been using the Braun Cruzer for more than 5 years.</li>
            <li> It took many passes for the hair to be removed and</li>
            <li> Still, it is faster than the water and foam method, so I use it most days.</li>
            <li> The shaver is ok - takes longer than a razor and gel and is not as close</li>
            <li> The adjustable length options for the shaver top are where I ran into issues.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terrible - just not my cup of tea.</li>
            <li> on my neck it seems to miss more.</li>
            <li> I am fairly satisfied with the razor, but I have a softer, light-colored beard.  </li>
            <li> I really like being able to shave in the shower and it has great battery life but</li>
            <li> Its an OK razor for trimming and what not</li>
            <li> /&gt;The best part about the Cruzer is that it did not irritate my skin, and I made several passes because the shaver needed time to get all the longer hairs.</li>
            <li> The series 7 is more box like in shape.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> I really love this shaver, it meets all my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ive been using shavers for four years and most have had problems after a couple months of use despite my attempt to maintain them.</li>
            <li> Love this razor, I&#x27;ve had the cruiser 3 before.</li>
            <li> wish that it had a couple more &#x27;length options&#x27; for trimming my beard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, my opinion: The Braun Cruzer is worth the investment and is a good shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Better than Philips.</li>
            <li> it was much better than this junk.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much better than this...</li>
            <li> Thru the years, I have used many shavers and beard trimmers.</li>
            <li> I would have been happier ordering Braun&#x27;s head and beard trimmer instead since it allows more length settings and has much much more battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are probably better out there though.</li>
            <li> favorite electric razor</li>
            <li> this should be the end of the cruzers series , Avoid avoid avoid , for $30 u can get a better shaver and save yourself some bucks.</li>
            <li> This product does a lot of things really well, but does not do any one thing great.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s also able to be used in the shower.</li>
            <li> We are returning this razor for a better model.  </li>
            <li> Very unique idea of combining so many shaving features.</li>
            <li> The trimmer on the other hand is amazing, and the best you can find for the price.</li>
            <li> The attachments work nicely and cleanly.  </li>
            <li> though is pretty good.</li>
            <li> - The battery life is pretty good...</li>
            <li> I guess this is pretty good</li>
            <li> It charges quickly and looks nice, but it has lots of attachments.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and charges nicely.  </li>
            <li> - The close shave portion (grill area) is great for the chin, upper lip, and cheek areas and gives a nice, close shave&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it , very cool , strong , powerful&lt;br</li>
            <li> guard is very comfortable, the cut is accurate.  </li>
            <li> It works fine, the shaver could be better, but it is what you should expect for this price.</li>
            <li> Overall, very good versatile razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy about Braun shaving products so far.</li>
            <li> I bought this primarily for the trimmer aspect of it, which works OK.  </li>
            <li> liked the Cruzer 6 better than the Cruzer 5, because it seemed to operate at a higher seed (inside motor seemed to rotate faster), although it is a bit louder than a Philips/Norelco that I stopped using altogether.  </li>
            <li> Effectively, shaver part will be rarely used by me.</li>
            <li> The perfect gift for the bearded one or the guy who can&#x27;t decide and sometimes sports a whisker or two and other times goes smoothed faced.  </li>
            <li> After 3 days, I was able to do a clean shave within 2 minutes and my face looks as if I used a razor to shave.</li>
            <li> The Cruzer 6  came with a charging stand and can also be charged just with the power cord for easy travel--</li>
            <li> /&gt;Braun does not make it easy to contact the company.  </li>
            <li> It does not seem to easily trim the hair with length that i want.</li>
            <li> like than you don&#x27;t get a clean shave, but for all than like looks a 3 day beard, is ok</li>
            <li> Easy to maintain.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> I like it a lot is easy and I going to get another one for my son, because he keeps taking mine.</li>
            <li> Of course nothing works better than a razor for a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> Some guys just cant get used to holding the electric razors at perfect right angles to their face, or their hair doesnt cut as well with these, as with regular razor blades.</li>
            <li> Some guys just cant get used to holding the electric razors at perfect right angles to their face, or their hair doesnt cut as well with these, as with regular razor blades.</li>
            <li> The rotatable, retractable trimmer still works beautifully after several months of ownership, and use in and out of the shower</li>
            <li> I do charge it a couple times a week probably as it shaves better with a full charge, but battery life is not a drawback to me.</li>
            <li> This is good for me because I live in a dorm</li>
            <li> this will work fine.</li>
            <li> Still works fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Simple, fabulous and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As all Braun machines, this worked fine for me</li>
            <li> The various guards make beard trimming easy and the twistable trimmer is great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a handy little device and great for traveling....</li>
            <li> Waterproof is a huge plus, really easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer feature on this unit, however, is FANTASTIC; uniform trimming and shaping every time.</li>
            <li> He likes that it is light and ergonomically designed.  </li>
            <li> when you switch the combs between 1-2-3 it slips from 2-3 or 1-2... and over time it is just not useable because it now runs free</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine there would be all these great reviews if people were having the same experience I did.  </li>
            <li> You can also clean it easily with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No tugging and pulling as I experienced with my last</li>
            <li> It feels great in your hand and it&#x27;s a lot smaller than competitive products.</li>
            <li> As smooth as it gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : It is a fantastic electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : It is a fantastic electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great tool to shape facial hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean, just run under water.</li>
            <li> It is light weight and feels like someone designed it to fit in my hand.</li>
            <li> It is not that fantastic</li>
            <li> then I can attest that it will do a great overall job.</li>
            <li> Easy clean with water proof.</li>
            <li> I primarily use it to maintain a stubble length</li>
            <li> It makes my skin smooth as if I shaved with a razor in almost all spots on my face.</li>
            <li> Having purchased Braun products before, I was surprised as their quality is usually so good.</li>
            <li> It is perfect to keep a 2/3 days beard thanks to its extra tools.</li>
            <li> I wear a goatee and this trimmer helps keep my old gray whiskers looking good.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is quite good at simply shaving your face clean, but then again most electric razors can do that as well.  </li>
            <li> Since the trimmers were the primary reason I got the razor in the first place, I&#x27;m well satisfied with this aspect of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this is a great product for the price as long as you grow a light beard.</li>
            <li> Good shaver, not as close a shave as my old braun with dual shaving heads but good enough for the price.</li>
            <li> I have found it works best if I use shaving cream, and that&#x27;s a feature not many foil shavers have.</li>
            <li> It is waterproof, so you can rinse it clean, or even use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think you will ever achieve a clean shave with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this braun shaver; however, i didn&#x27;t like its clean shave.</li>
            <li> If you need it for clean shave, I think you must go for another one.</li>
            <li> Buy a trimmer instead and use something else to clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> clean shave some areas</li>
            <li> If you are buying this and planning on using it to shave clean, look somewhere else.  </li>
            <li> Shaving cleanly?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve kept mine in great shape just doing a dry clean after every use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cant get a clean shave with.</li>
            <li> More importantly it gives you a very close shave.</li>
            <li> It has almost everything you need to any style from a clean shave to a stubble or goatee.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly similar to my first, which I liked, with some nice improvements  or enhancements.  </li>
            <li> I probably would&#x27;ve stuck with my normal shaver as it does a better clean shave, for people who like to have a trimmed or light shave look</li>
            <li> Fortunately I fit that category and enjoy this product very much.</li>
            <li> Good shaver, great trimming tools, works great on thick dark hair, and the fact that its waterproof is a plus!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great on trimming between eye brows with 1 mm trimmer, and the 28mm wide trimmer for side burns.</li>
            <li> All in all, a good product that I now use regularly.</li>
            <li> But for me even when I use it before my whiskers have more than 1/32 of an inch growth it still doesn&#x27;t shave very well</li>
            <li> FOr example, if you want that 3 day stubble look, you&#x27;d never be able to get that with a straight razor, without waiting 3 days after you shave.</li>
            <li> I must say that its trimmers are good enough.</li>
            <li> It turns the intended trimming/shaping operation into the need for a full shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had better luck with blades, but sometimes having an electric shaver is very convenient.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really comment on the foil aspect of it, but I ran it across my face and it was comfortable!</li>
            <li> One notable design feature is that the shaving surface is extra-wide; very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Braun, however, succeeds at failing in every respect possible.  </li>
            <li> I dont know why it has such good reviews.</li>
            <li> I still really like the Braun for it&#x27;s trimming combs, does much better on my goatee than my Wahl clippers, so for that alone</li>
            <li> So if you need your whole face shaven every day, the series 7 does better at shaving under the neck.</li>
            <li> Overall good buy.</li>
            <li> So, I am wondering whether only trimmer would have been good enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is OK with me because I use just one level on my whole beard and I like it.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use the beard grooming attachments, but they appear \\&quot;cool and trendy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> There could be some more beard length options, but really what is has is adequate.  </li>
            <li> There are two different sizes of trimmer built in to the razor itself, and that alone makes this a very attractive choice for a razor to take with you on the road, or to be able to use without having to fetch a bunch of other accessories, etc.</li>
            <li> I received an apology email right away, they confirmed my mailing address, and said the mailing label and instructions would be sent immediately.  </li>
            <li> The number of accessories are a bit daunting and it took me a few tries with the trimmer attachments to figure out what settings are best for me, but overall, an excellent product.</li>
            <li> , it is a joy to use both, but if you want something other than those two options is not your machine</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the third electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned, and I&#x27;m very impressed with its overall performance and versatility.</li>
            <li> Adequate range of lengths too.</li>
            <li> It takes about two minutes for the quick charge.</li>
            <li> Quick fix with super glue and</li>
            <li> The only real con i experienced was at the beginning.</li>
            <li> The Braun Cruzer is the most comfortable shaver I&#x27;ve used so far.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product for trimming sideburns, neatening up beards or 5 o&#x27;clock shadows, etc., but it&#x27;s an absolute nightmare to use for an actual shave.</li>
            <li> It is acceptable for quick shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and then you will achieve a perfect result.&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is a bit short, because everytime you shave you have to charge it or sometimes at the middle of the shaving process</li>
            <li> Works best for the hair right under my nose, which is sometimes hard to reach with a razor.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good at trimming beards and straightening up your sideburns, mustaches, etc, but it&#x27;s not good at getting you as nice, clean shave.</li>
            <li> the other heads are very handy.</li>
            <li> Probably okay for light duty or weekend use but not part of my regular line-up when being clean-shaven is important.</li>
            <li> The trimmer gets close and is fairly comfortable to use (also easier than the higher end ones I use because it slides up instead of out</li>
            <li> This unit is particularly useful if you have a full beard, as the trimmers have comb attachments for beard trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve worn beards several times over the years, but never had such a nice tool for keeping them looking good.</li>
            <li> I love the new precision comb that use for eyebrow</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it charges very quickly, unlike my Norelco grooming shaver that I had that would take a whole day to charge.</li>
            <li> I suppose that if you shaved every day or don&#x27;t let the whiskers get more than 1/32 of an inch long then it might shave better.</li>
            <li> Very compact and easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s really easy to use and very precise.&lt;br</li>
            <li> product does exactly what I want it to do!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to people interested in using an electric shaver!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave anywhere near as comfortable as the 7-9 series but it&#x27;s manageable and easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to hold shaver at 90&#x27;angle, then you will get a real close shave without a burn.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for shaving everyday.</li>
            <li> Thus far I have only used it a couple of times, but am impressed so far.</li>
            <li> That said, if you already use electric, this is a nice product with no obvious drawbacks to me.</li>
            <li> His old clippers that he&#x27;s had for years is able to give a closer shave than this.</li>
            <li> Initially, I thought that maybe you need a heap of hair to use this shaver effectively</li>
            <li> -Lightweight, easy to grip  -cordless with decent battery life  </li>
            <li> I actually own a Series 7 Braun shaver and bought this Cruzer only as a \\&quot;travel shaver\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric in many years, but the same basic problem remains - they don&#x27;t really do a good job of shaving closely.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth having.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly compact for travel and is great for maintaining face, mustache and beard because of the various trimmer and shaver options - no need for several different trimmers - this one does it all.  </li>
            <li> however does a far better job of maintaining a goatee.</li>
            <li> We never took it out of the box after he made his wishes more clear.</li>
            <li> One man&#x27;s opinion, and your mileage may vary, but I can say with the utmost certainty that I won&#x27;t be using a razor any more, and I&#x27;m glad I saved roughly $100 by skipping the higher priced offerings.</li>
            <li> just those two trimmers do pretty much everything I need, and I could almost see paying a fair sum for a device that did only what the two trimmers do.</li>
            <li> and I always loved having a sharp square goatee.</li>
            <li> right time</li>
            <li> Stuck between a 2 and 3 star rating right now.  </li>
            <li> I want to do it right.</li>
            <li> This is handy if you just want to take one tool for travel trimming, but it is pretty flimsy and doesn&#x27;t stand up to daily use.</li>
            <li> Fast trim, precision cut, and a clean stubble look.</li>
            <li> I bought it primarily as a goatee/mustache trimmer as I use a razor for normal shaving, however I&#x27;ve used it for close shaving as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seemed like a great idea to get a combination shaver/trimmer that has a slick design and manufactured by Braun.</li>
            <li> And now I find myself with an adjustable trimmer that doesn&#x27;t adjust and an electric shaver that&#x27;s barely qualified to touch any of our lovely faces.</li>
            <li> Quiet, powerful, and very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> battery life is good for a shaver, at half an hour between charges.</li>
            <li> The head has a bit of a spring action to it, allowing you to get a really close shave and pain free!  </li>
            <li> If yours are more stiff and you like using electric razors, this is an exceptional product that you will enjoy for a long time.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t have very much stubble</li>
            <li> It must be a defect in the design since I&#x27;ve been very gentle with my unit.</li>
            <li> to use and is very gentle on skin.</li>
            <li> Not the most gentle, but good for harder to trim areas and actually works.  </li>
            <li> Very nice results when used as trimmer, using it for shaving not much you can only get nice results when used after regular blates</li>
            <li> The plastic piece that pops out for trimming broke within the first week.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty versatile product.  </li>
            <li> When my wife first put the shaver on my lap</li>
            <li> negatives, however, keep me from rating this product higher.</li>
            <li> First, as a shaver the Cruzer leaves a lot to be desired.</li>
            <li> my last braun shaver I could go for 24 hours or more between shaves.</li>
            <li> at first i thought it was because my skin needed time to get used to it</li>
            <li> but after the first month it was still not shaving properly.&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li> braun is my first face shaver from braun  </li>
            <li> tried to use the razor on my legs first and it didn&#x27;t cut any hair off at all.  </li>
            <li> First, the face shaver, that works like all electric shavers have since they&#x27;ve been around.</li>
            <li> Regarding shaving performance, it is only okay.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d suggest getting a higher end model.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not the most quiet shaver out there by any means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Alright so got the product in yesterday and today decided to use it for the first time.</li>
            <li> First of all, if I skip shaving for a day, this won&#x27;t get the job done</li>
            <li> The trimmers work pretty well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I recommend it as a first electric razor.</li>
            <li> I had one of the first generation Cruzer razors and accidentally dropped it while on a trip and the rotating trimmer broke off</li>
            <li> Plan to do that often, because the foil shaver won&#x27;t work without first plowing over your face with the trimmer.</li>
            <li> I had some adjustment to getting use to this shaver at first.</li>
            <li> Because my hair is shaved in the neck now, I believe daily usage will do a better job at getting all of them.</li>
            <li> Because my hair is short, I think it will work much better</li>
            <li> On those occasions I attack the whiskers first with the trimmer, then go over everything again with the shaving head.</li>
            <li> First, my qualifications: I&#x27;m a man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Economical price, found as described and fast</li>
            <li> /&gt;Strongly recommended, will deal again in future for sure.</li>
            <li> get me wrong, trimmer is excellent and I do not mind the option of having an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> But thought of sharing with the next &#x27;stubble&#x27; person who looks at this one! :)</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty light-weight.</li>
            <li> Beard trimming is mediocre at best.  </li>
            <li> This product was made for young guys (in their 20&#x27;s) with light beards.</li>
            <li> If I was able to grow enough of a beard to use these attachments, I doubt the trimmer would meet my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> while the shaver itself could be a little more effective, I suspect this is partly a function of the limits of electric razors in general.</li>
            <li> In summary, while the shaver itself could be a little more effective, I suspect this is partly a function of the limits of electric razors in general.</li>
            <li> and I also loved some of the features to do things like trim sideburns because my 4 year old son often needs his hair trimmed up on the back of his neck and around the sideburn area before he really needs a whole</li>
            <li> It also does a nice job of maintaining cheek and neck lines looking sharp.  </li>
            <li> I do not use this machine as much as a lot of people because i cannot grow a full beard yet, but it is incredibly good to clean my face and keep all my facial hair at one level so it wont look messy.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made, doesn&#x27;t give close shave, and makes a mess unlike the vacuum kind.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very comfortable to use on my face both wet and dry and is very easy to clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First, the Cruzer comes with a built-in rechargeable battery that is ready to go out of the box.</li>
            <li> It misses many hairs on my neck and leaves them long.</li>
            <li> The narrow trimmer is great for trimming a mustache along the lip line or other fine work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hesitant to use it in the shower only because it&#x27;s electric and that kind of stuff freaks me out, but apparently it&#x27;s do-able!</li>
            <li> The notches on the guard that allow you to select the beard length wear out very easily and now mine won&#x27;t stay on any setting other than the shortest.  </li>
            <li> My face is super sensitive to razors.</li>
            <li> This model is a bit sleeker and there are no problems with its ability to function purely as a shaver.</li>
            <li> far as designing a good combo shaver/trimmer razor, the folks at Braun are half way there.</li>
            <li> Every once in a while they may need a nice, soft, dry brush.</li>
            <li> I had to go over the same spot more than 5 times to get it completely shaved!</li>
            <li> Thanks for that it awsome</li>
            <li> thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li> The Shaver really met my expectations!&lt;br /&gt;So</li>
            <li> Procter &amp; Gamble really dropped the ball on this product..</li>
            <li> The way the two trimmers can be swiveled and slid into place is very convenient.  </li>
            <li> The trimmers work much better than the shaver - be careful as you learn to use it.</li>
            <li> it does not cut real close.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t just because it wasn&#x27;t really indended for that</li>
            <li> Again, it didn&#x27;t really cut any hair off.  </li>
            <li> This BRAUN shaver kit really DOES come with everything...</li>
            <li> charges fast, and comes with a charging stand.  </li>
            <li> It does provide a smooth shave, but you have to work at it a bit, especially with my course</li>
            <li> It does this very well.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m able, I will amend this with my findings while wet shaving with  the Braun Cruzer 6.</li>
            <li> Very</li>
            <li> His dad had no issues though he much prefers his [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt to shave though, just isn&#x27;t extremely fast for me.</li>
            <li> Since I have a goatee this is quite an improvement over anything else I used before, and much easier than getting out my Wahl clippers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very close shave on my face but</li>
            <li> I really like the Braun product line and this shaver</li>
            <li> likes that it is lightweight, yet very efficient.</li>
            <li> It works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A responsible company would have immediately shipped me a replacement attachment at no cost.  </li>
            <li> and I decided to find something that worked no matter how much it cost me.</li>
            <li> I attribute its better performance under my chin to the center cutter that is positioned between the two foil cutters.</li>
            <li> Works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver</li>
            <li> It shaves close without irritation and ttrimmer works very well with my beard.  </li>
            <li> With this product I can get it really close, but it just takes a lot of passes.  </li>
            <li> It holds a charge very well.  </li>
            <li> In my experience I had to spend nearly 20 minutes making pass after pass from as many different angles as I could.</li>
            <li> I bought the Andis T outliner, and it worked great for a trim, but it was never accurate enough to give me the sharpness I was looking for around my chin, and using that thing to shave my neck area was a nightmare.</li>
            <li> it works good as new but it wasn&#x27;t a long enough fall to do damage.</li>
            <li> The big problem is that it&#x27;s not very powerful and does not do a good job of shaving.</li>
            <li> Really, how much better can it be than other shavers?  </li>
            <li> far up to now, it didn&#x27;t let me down for sure!</li>
            <li> It will cut thick hair, but for a clean controlled cut, you can do better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a weakness of the Cruzer6 so much as it is a weakness of the foiled-electric-shaver design generally; just know that you won&#x27;t be able to let yourself go for a week, then get clean-shaven, using only this device (or ANY electric shaver)-</li>
            <li> but I simply can&#x27;t recommend this Cruzer because half of what it purports to do--arguably the more important half--it doesn&#x27;t really do.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s not a mess of attachments to clutter my bathroom up with and that everything is right there on the razor.</li>
            <li> The other reviews are great, even from women using it to cut the hair on their legs and other non-intended uses.  </li>
            <li> The foil shaver isn&#x27;t as smooth as Braun&#x27;s higher models but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s waterproof, it&#x27;s easy to clean, it sits in a recharging base, the foil can be replaced (though I don&#x27;t know about the trimmer head), and most importantly is comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Not only does that little Cruzer 6 shave closer, but it is more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> It is cheaply made and takes twice as long to save with this shaver</li>
            <li> : It is an electric razor.t that you will enjoy for a long time.</li>
            <li> A full charge will net you 30 minutes of shaving.</li>
            <li> After a full days growth this trimmer performs moderately well but nowhere close to shaving with a razor.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t get a full sweeping stroke, such as under the nose, because of the shape of the guard.  </li>
            <li> This is the first electric razor that I have ever used and so far I think I like it.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I could prevent this by just charging the shaver once a week (only takes about 15 min for a full charge).</li>
            <li> and I ultimately had to use a normal, non-electric razor to get a clean shave after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After reading some of the negative reviews I was a little hesitant to purchase the newer Cruzer, but I&#x27;ve been very happy with it!  </li>
            <li> (proves that it&#x27;s just hard to do more than one thing well)</li>
            <li> Overall, dry shaving with either of those two is good enough for me, and my four year old daughter, who has become my beard tester, pretty much says daddy doesn&#x27;t need a shave afterwords.  </li>
            <li> The Cruzer is smaller,feels better in my hand, and easier to handle along the jaw line and under the nose, and costs a lot less than the Braun Series 7 Pulsonic and the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> The results with that shaver are similar to my experience with the newer Cruzer - okay in a pinch or for the weekend but definitely not the replacement to razor</li>
            <li> This is a decent shaver if you want a close shave.</li>
            <li> The main benefit is the goatee/ mustache trimmer.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m making do with an older one I still have.    </li>
            <li> Similar the Cruzer 5, the Cruzer 6 seems also to suffer from the \\&quot;needing to go over your face many times\\&quot; to get all the hairs syndrome, but it does not leave the red bumps like the Philips 2D model I used just once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After two days of giving it a go, he went back to his more traditional Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> the older</li>
            <li> the beard comb attachment (the larger attachment with blue colored comb), which is the one I used most often broke.  </li>
            <li> Most of the beard trimmers I found weren&#x27;t deep enough to maintain a beard.</li>
            <li> After seeing really decent reviews I was convinced to buy this shaver.</li>
            <li> However, if a decent one is all you&#x27;re looking for, then go for it rather than a $10-20 one.</li>
            <li> I have took this product mainly for shaving ,after using</li>
            <li> I felt that attachments will convert main blade into a trimmer and if you remove attachments, it will become a shaver.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d just like to point out that it is highly unlike myself to sit here and write about a product</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It comes highly recommended from my husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed other reviewers mention that the foiled shaver itself isn&#x27;t quite as effective as they&#x27;d like, and I have to second this.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it on my face every time—I will NOT have my pits look like a prickly, irritated wasteland or Cthulhu&#x27;s mustache after a run-in an overheated flat iron— but it should be more solidly built than this.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also a clear plastic clip, for the large (face) shaving head.</li>
            <li> Now I rated this four stars because when I was finished the shave was very close and even though I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The foil trimmer he has complained about and to be honest</li>
            <li> Oh, well, I&#x27;ve kept the box and will be able to send it back when it refuses to charge at all, which I suspect won&#x27;t be long.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s pretty unrealistic to buy an electric shaver and expect a shave as good as a razor.</li>
            <li> If I let mine grow for more than about three days, this has trouble with it.</li>
            <li> I had this a few months and love it.  </li>
            <li> Just missing more levels for the trim.</li>
            <li> However, only smaller blades on top of the product act as trimmers while attachments completely cover its shaver part.</li>
            <li> sure if I made a mistake in understanding usage or was the description not clear enough on the site.</li>
            <li> But overall it would be worth it if it lasts.</li>
            <li> It has only the one snap on head to trim to a even length that&#x27;s just right for my mustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I am playing with blades right next to my throat right?&lt;br</li>
            <li> It can do a quick charge though, and doesn&#x27;t take too long to fully charge.</li>
            <li> While this shaver has some nice features and has multiple applications, it did a poor job when it came to a clean shave.</li>
            <li> the price it can do many different things, such as generally shaving my face and neck, trimming my beard, and keeping my sideburns nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband loves his new shaver.  </li>
            <li> , I have had time to use my new Series 7, 790 braun shaver that just came in.</li>
            <li> Please live up to Braun&#x27;s name.</li>
            <li> I like it, and will continue to use it when I want a quick dry shave.</li>
            <li> The top popped off a few times when using it near my chin and jaw line.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, the larger trimmer was accurate enough and the smaller trimmer on the flipside was put the dots on the I and crosses the T.</li>
            <li> But before you order, be very clear about why you are ordering it.</li>
            <li> He does not like that it is very loud, and he says it does not give a good shave if you let your facial hair get very long -- in other words, if he doesn&#x27;t shave every day, it does not work well.  </li>
            <li> so I look a little older, which is important for my job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As with most other Braun items we have used, the device is fully made in Germany with the only power cord originating in China.</li>
            <li> Seems better than other similar products.</li>
            <li> you wish, just use the blue clip, and the snap up shaver, and you can get that very short hair look, and also clean up around the neck, etc.</li>
            <li> so I use my other Braun shaver for totally clean shave.</li>
            <li> The adjustment button, free spirit that it is, then flew right down the drain after being sandwiched between the two other parts instead of more firmly connected to either.</li>
            <li> It takes a very short time for recharging and it is very powerful and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Upon trying the old one again while the new one was recharging, i realized it was hurting my face and didn&#x27;t give me anywhere near as close a shave as The Braun Cruzer 6.   </li>
            <li> My problem came when innocent me thought that it is so fashionable now that we&#x27;re both men, the beard of three days two slightly trimmed, which allows us to not shave daily but not go</li>
            <li> I am guilt free when I shave my neck now, and having a square goatee that is clean and sharp everyday is dreamy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does a much better job when I use it every day or every other day when my beard isn&#x27;t as long.</li>
            <li> Okay I read the reviews, nearly all of them, starting with the negative then moving to the positive.</li>
            <li> -The length guide for the trimmer greatly reduces the effectiveness of the cutting</li>
            <li> The Cruzer itself seems sturdy and not too light or too heavy in hand.</li>
            <li> One trimmer is built into the back of the unit and swivels making some trimming jobs much easier than contorting your hand or wrist.</li>
            <li> And using the trimmer head to shorten them enough so that the foil will shave them doesn&#x27;t work very well either.</li>
            <li> As far as it&#x27;s performance...</li>
            <li> Braun&#x27;s website lists a part number for it, but they do not sell their parts directly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using my 5 year old series 3 380.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I can see what i&#x27;m doing), I don&#x27;t use the smaller one too much.</li>
            <li> the Cruzer 6 is surprisingly loud</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, I think this shaver was either designed by someone who has no concept of what hair is, or, it&#x27;s meant for those baby-faced Swedish boy models you see in Ralph Lauren ads that have 3 soft baby hairs on their chin that they&#x27;ve never cut.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll have to use the old fashioned, disposable, 4-blade razor to touch up after it.</li>
            <li> The young one in  </li>
            <li> They trim close and have given no nicks so far.  </li>
            <li> So far, the 3-head has been the answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Instead, I&#x27;m nearly three months without the use of the razor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Please do not waste your time ordering and returning this</li>
            <li> and this shaver has had no trouble dealing with it.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Mid size shaver, it charges fast and easy.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> - The trimmer cuts through days/weeks old growth with no trouble, and doesn&#x27;t nick or cut my face</li>
            <li> This shaver has many pros and only a few cons.</li>
            <li> Not perfect but really good.</li>
            <li> The trimming tools are very handy especially when trying to clean up unwanted body hair, however, I was a little disappointed with the performance of the shaving head when set for a clean shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m low-maintenance when it comes to shaving the face these days; I largely let it grow and only shave my face clean once every few weeks, trimming and &#x27;cleaning up&#x27; the rest of the time</li>
            <li> In fact, even tho you get a plain blue cardboard box to keep these barber supplies together, you will probibly want to buy a more durable plastic box.</li>
            <li> Its all but nessacary for beard grooming, tho, unless you want to play around with scissors for an hour.ou get a plain blue cardboard box to keep these barber supplies together, you will probibly want to buy a more durable plastic box.</li>
            <li> Shaving dry, the Panasonic is slightly, but noticeably, better than the Braun Series 7.  </li>
            <li> This is the only reason I&#x27;m still using it and haven&#x27;t gleefully thrown it off a high building in order to joyfully observe it smash into thousands of unusable pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought it with high expectations, and the $70-ish price reinforced those expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, for a product with such versatility, there are no usable instructions.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use it to actually shave my face with, since I prefer using a non-electric razor on my face since I have real sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a small, light, well-designed unit.  </li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would live up to half of the things it says it does and after having it a few weeks, some of them are better than others.  </li>
            <li> With the disposable razor I can get a lot closer shave in a lot less time so the electric foil shaver just isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> The only thing he says is on his wish list is a meter to show how much charge is left.</li>
            <li> Instructions are the same for different models, and don&#x27;t really explain what each piece should be used</li>
            <li> As a shaver, it works no better or worse than the average foil shaver, which is good enough for most men who shave every day.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and regularly draw blood with a razor because of it.</li>
            <li> the family prefers it for grooming his facial fuzz rather than taking it down to a full shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been skeptical of electric shavers since first having tried them many years ago with a different Braun foil shaver.</li>
            <li> You continually have to go over the same area multiple times from different directions and with all the other electric shavers I&#x27;ve had I&#x27;ve only usually needed to go twice against the grain to get a great shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to cut down a grown-out beard before wet shaving or to shape up an outline.  </li>
            <li> for cleaning, you can usually blow the blades clean after removing the blade screen.</li>
            <li> This cruzer does a decent enough job shaving that I think I may send the 790 back, but I don&#x27;t know, we will see when I test it.</li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t shave for two or more days, the whiskers are too tough for the shaving head to handle without discomfort.</li>
            <li> I keep my neck clean shaven and here is where this product is only slightly above average.  </li>
            <li> Bought it as a replacement for my last Cruzer 6 after it died of old age.</li>
            <li> He have shaved completely as well as played with different types of beard styles.  </li>
            <li> After I received this razor, I went to check reviews to see if others were having the same issues I am and was surprised to see that, no, they weren&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty average.</li>
            <li> would only recommend this to a 15 year old.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say my beard is pretty average.  </li>
            <li> Even on days of regular use I have to constantly go over an area at different angles to get it to cut reasonably well.</li>
            <li> As far as the cheeks, chin, and mouth area, for me they perform the same.</li>
            <li> , this machine is not for that, is to shave completely and not leave even one hair on the face, or to adecuarte or recortarte a dense beard, no stubble rather serves only to a beard of weeks .&lt;br</li>
            <li> the smaller trimmer was an unexpected surprise as well.</li>
            <li> It only offers 4 guard levels for beard trimming.  </li>
            <li> The cruzer is also smaller and therefor is better for targeting specific areas, such as if you want a square mustache and you need to trim a line just underneath the nose with the shave, this is possible with the cruser because of its narrow rectangular foil.</li>
            <li> However, it didn&#x27;t shave as close as the old traditional razor and shaving cream, and I found it a bit more irritating on the skin too.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is ok with trimming your beard, but it is poor at face shaving.</li>
            <li> Compared to my husband&#x27;s other shaver, it covered a much smaller area of the face and required multiple times going over the same area to get a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> Cruzer 6 also has a very useful charging stand (and small clear plastic shaving guard); however, other than that, these two Braun razors seem nearly identical.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this because of other Braun products that I owned had worked really well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this a few months now (from Vine, obviously), and I pretty much gave up using it as a shaver after the second try; it just left too much of a mess behind on my face, and I&#x27;m fairly certain I could&#x27;ve moved it around my face for a good hour and little visible difference from my pre-shave condition.</li>
            <li> Although I have not had a chance to use the Cruzer wet shaving, I did find that the Panasonic, with a little soap (I use a bit of shampoo because it&#x27;s slicker) is definitely better than dry shaving.</li>
            <li> My big question, was if I could also use it on my hair, cos I like short, nearly shaved hair on my head.</li>
            <li> - The grill area does poorly in the neck area, especially with hair that is 2 days or more in length.</li>
            <li> but they must have had the mane of a unicorn because this isn&#x27;t good at cutting facial hair at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a decent shaver that wouldn&#x27;t empty my wallet.  </li>
            <li> but, took a little getting use to at first.</li>
            <li> Took far too long to finish shaving.</li>
            <li> i have had this shaver for a few month now and it is pretty aweful.</li>
            <li> this machine is not for guys with full thick beards.&lt;br</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Comfortable shave with minimal tug &amp; pull, but not very effective razor.  </li>
            <li> and I really couldn&#x27;t rate it down if I wasn&#x27;t using it as intended.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, it is worth mentioning a word or two about shaving wet with either the Panasonic or the Braun Cruzer (the more expensive Braun Pulsonic cannot be used wet).  </li>
            <li> It pinched my skin and would cut me from time to time, also too much Andis was no better than using a razor because it irritated my skin in the neck area from frequent usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact and has a quick charge feature that let&#x27;s you finish shaving if the unit loses it&#x27;s charge before you&#x27;re finished.</li>
            <li> a very poor shaving machine that u will need to clean ur face with a razor after using it, push it as much as u can to ur face and it will still leave those greeny hair all over ur face , my advice Dont buy it</li>
            <li> If you just want to put the beard and mustache attachments aside and use it for a straight razor when the wife has laid down the law and the facial hair had to go...</li>
            <li> So I end up trimming part of my beard (which is what I bought it for), and using normal shaving blades to shave the other part.</li>
            <li> It was super delicate to my skin and its a shaver that I can use daily now.</li>
            <li> So, Unless you desire a combined shaver/ trimmer, pass on this one and buy a less expensive model shaver and a more capable trimmer.</li>
            <li> They do not offer much adjustment leaving no options for replacing a Wahl trimmer for short tight hair cuts.  </li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve ever used an electric shaver, it took me a few shaves to get the technique to get a clean shave without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> the charging dock, the little brush to clean up the shaving head, all the various clipping heads, so you can adjust the lenght of the cut, oil for the blades if they get sticky, and the little grooming clip for clipping too bushy eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> The cut is quick, it takes only a few passes to trim all the hair - my facial hair tends to lie down, the passes are needed to catch</li>
            <li> Alas, the new one gets hot while charging which means it&#x27;s been sitting in a box for years and the batteries are about to stop working.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using a 3-head electric razor for more than 30 years because he has a extremely fast-growing, tough beard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Generally speaking, I find myself having to shave cleanly with my Mach 4 blade about 30% of the time after using this shaver; it&#x27;s diabolically poor.  </li>
            <li> -The trimmer blades (both the wide one and the narrow precision one) cut pretty well.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be throwing your hard earned money in the trash, which is exactly what I had to do.</li>
            <li> Even with less growth, it can take 20 minutes to do a complete, close shave, and that doesn&#x27;t include my upper lip or chin areas, as I keep a goatee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m upset that this shaver did not live up to it&#x27;s potential.</li>
            <li> It is no worth to change the old Braun cruzer Shaver</li>
            <li> the battery dose not last for long time as mentioned 30 min.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to go over the neck area in four different directions, and then there is still lots of hair that is missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> marketing behind it was cool and</li>
            <li> Even after going through Braun&#x27;s site, I was not able to figure out whether main blade will do trimming with attachments or will rear trimmer act as only trimmer.  </li>
            <li> The only issue is it is a little loud, but wakes you up in the morning.</li>
            <li> But it is difficult to shave my completely smooth anyway with my regular razor.</li>
            <li> It can be rotated 180° to use a 90° wide trimmer or a straight, narrow trimmer blade.</li>
            <li> There are quite a few of these grooming sets on the market, so you need to spend a little time choosing the one that is right for you.  </li>
            <li> Doesnt matter how hard I try or how much a expand my skin of my face.</li>
            <li> It can be a little tricky when shaving near the beard line because you have to be careful making multiple passes so close to your beard</li>
            <li> Too bad, nice look and feel, but it just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> When I used them the whole process (and result) was clumsy and subpar.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been a blade man for a long time.  </li>
            <li> The product description states the the Cruzer has an extra wide shave head.</li>
            <li> The foil on the Cruzer is simply smoother riding along my face and there is absolutely no irritation.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the design and versatility of the Cruzer6 really go a long way to make up for this.</li>
            <li> but I spent 10-15mins go back and forth over my face.</li>
            <li> so I have an excuse to throw this thing in the bin.</li>
            <li> It comes with a plastic guard attachment (as shown in the images), which can be fitted into about 3 positions for trimming at various lengths using the wide trimmer.</li>
            <li> I have been a die-hard Norelco customer for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone long stretches without having to recharge it (weeks)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always end up with missed long hairs, patchy spots, and then split ends of hair (like having fishing hooks stuck in my face).</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s built sturdy to last with the added bonus of being waterproof so you can shave in the shower on those mornings you have to cut those extra minutes down.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the new Cruzer will not run when plugged in, the Cruzer 2 would.  </li>
            <li> and you can switch to the smaller trimmer head for trimming your mustache and other detail trimming.</li>
            <li> Moving on to something a little more expensive from Panasonic, hoping it goes well.</li>
            <li> battery lasts for a very long time&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works dry?  </li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor and I&#x27;m not very impressed with the way it shaves.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works pretty well so far, but not great, and with all of the other tools on the device it makes it slightly unwieldy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned to go with the grain and then track down the occasional long hair that is missed.</li>
            <li> understand it&#x27;s reasonably priced, and that it comes with a lot of cool-looking pieces of plastic, but it&#x27;s not a good electric razor by any measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can clean this with water, but you&#x27;ll need to pay more attention to oiling the blades and all that nasty mess.</li>
            <li> Every time I try to put it on notch 2 or 3, it slips back down to notch 1 and give me a closer trip than I want.  </li>
            <li> I only use to get closer after my razor shave... not good for getting down through beard (or even 5 o&#x27;clock shadow) down to skin in the first place</li>
            <li> But the foil head on this razor doesn&#x27;t work very well or hardly at all on whiskers that are about an eighth of an inch long or a little longer.</li>
            <li> Its well designed, and for having 3 cutting heads, three plastic clips (one which is adjustable to 4 lenghts), its really easy to use.</li>

            <li> not good cuz the perfomance is low not take clearly</li>
            <li> and it also misses slightly longer hairs at the side of the face.&lt;br /&gt;By the way I shave on a daily basis.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I rate the dry performance of these two roughly 87% to 90% of a razor shave.  </li>
            <li> I had used a different Braun shaver previously to this one.</li>
            <li> My last one was a mess and got hair all over my bag when I put it up- who has time to brush their shavers after every use!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> In my experience, the key has always been to hit stubble before it gets very long, else the foil has a bit of trouble with the longer stubble.</li>
            <li> It also causes slight irritation of my cheeks and neck after using it for a couple of days straight (I have thick hair)</li>
            <li> If you have a less stiff beard and have had problems with electrics in the past, this won&#x27;t be very much different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have a less stiff beard and have had problems with electrics in the past, this won&#x27;t be very much different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A nice feature on the Cruzer is the wet cleaner under a stream of water; it is less messy than removing the head and brushing off the cutting bar.</li>
            <li> With a little practice the Cruzer 6 beats the regular trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Overall:  If I can find the part I need, I may keep using this as a shaper/trimmer, but it is impossible to shave cleanly with.</li>
            <li> all of which became partially useless in few months of light use.</li>
            <li> Or at least younger skin that hasn&#x27;t yet grown accustomed to regular shaving.  </li>
            <li> Results will vary and that&#x27;s expected but for me this wouldn&#x27;t be a recommended product.</li>
            <li> and there was really no difference.</li>
            <li> So basically I needed an all-in one that wouldn&#x27;t break if I got it wet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give the Panasonic a 95% to 97% compared to a razor, but with absolutely no irritation, cuts, nicks, or razor burn.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for a few months already, and have only had to charge it up one time.</li>
            <li> and it really cut poorly as a result.</li>
            <li> I only thing I&#x27;m having trouble with is finding a way to keep the whiskers just beneath my nose trimmed.  </li>
            <li> That shaver required me to press harder against my face to feel a close shave.</li>
            <li> so then the hair has a minimal length, and then you use the shaver part.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He says it gives a closer shave, and he loves the attachments, especially the wide and narrow trimmer.</li>
            <li> That was was due to me being use to my old one and having to press so hard to try and get a close shave.</li>
            <li> The only problem I ever had was that the beard trimmer blades stopped working, but when they did, the Cruzer was a fully functional shaver and beard trimmer as long as you provided proper maintenance by oiling the cutting block every so often, and of course cleaning the device after every 2nd or 3rd use as a shaver and after every use as a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> A minor breakout and a little discomfort may result - though if you have already been shaving regularly for a while, I doubt you&#x27;ll have much trouble.  </li>
            <li> 8 Months later I got tired of how long it takes to shave and found a Remington 5800 that was a big improvement.</li>
            <li> I shopped long and hard and watched several YouTube videos before buying this one.</li>
            <li> I also can&#x27;t mark it down as I have little experience with the proper technique with electric shavers.</li>
            <li> I get about a week and a half to two weeks shaving on a single charge.  </li>
            <li> I bought this shaver because i have a severely sensitive skin, now have absolutely no problem shaving several times a week, the shaver is versatile especially when yo have 1 week growth because you can use the cutting head then the shaving head.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this just isn&#x27;t a very capable product.</li>
            <li> All of this happens even while being extra careful, cutting really close, taking my time, etc.</li>
            <li> The other problem with making repeated passes with the shaver is skin</li>
            <li> Like some other reviewers, I&#x27;m a girl and was hoping it would work to shave my legs</li>
            <li> If you need to do that, you will probibly need to buy the other razor BRAUN sells for that job.</li>
            <li> If you want it for other beard/goatee/trimming stuff, go ahead and pass on this one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason I bought it with all of the other options on the shelf was the product design.</li>
            <li> I shaved one side of my face with the Braun Series 7 Pulsonic and the other side with the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> The other feature he likes is the eyebrow attachment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Everything else has been said by the other reviewers.</li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t want the &#x27;stubble&#x27; look, he wanted a beard trimmer and something to keep the edges of his beard sharp.</li>
            <li> into other brands</li>
            <li> and I have to go over my face slowly and repeatedly several times taking several minutes longer to shave than the plain triple blade disposable</li>
            <li> All I can say is that I would not purchase it again given the chance, but will make due with it since it&#x27;s too late to get my money back.</li>
            <li> I have a difficult face to shave as my whiskers grow out at angles on certain spots.</li>
            <li> Also, the replacement foil and blades are half the price of the other two.  </li>
            <li> in all this is an average performer.</li>
            <li> razor portion is probably average for its class.  </li>
            <li> Well, if you have man beard, this machine is not useful, just do not shave ir well ...&lt;</li>
            <li> does not worth the money .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am about to write concerns dudes with thick coarse beards, like myself...</li>
            <li> There is a wide trimmer and a narrow trimmer, as well as a couple of comb</li>
            <li> The foil shaver is worse than a month old disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t grow a heavy beard, so I never really reach &#x27;mountain man&#x27; status).</li>
            <li> I have been suffering this razor rash type of reaction since I was 14, so I&#x27;ve been forced to shave my face only once a week and go scruffy the rest of the week until I knew I could shave again without messin&#x27; myself up.</li>
            <li> I use the large cutting edge to trim the main part of my beard and the small edge to get to the hard to trim places.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed that my local walmart carried it for $5 less though, but Amazon&#x27;s service is worth it.</li>
            <li> He has never liked electric shavers as they always left stubble or gave him a slight rash.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trimming at the longest setting and had it collapse down to the shortest setting without warning.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for thicker hair because it does pull/bog down on just my cheeks</li>
            <li> -The foil shaver head, as other reviewers have mentioned, is USELESS on coarse facial hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The \\&quot;wide trimmer\\&quot; on this model is extremely weak and cuts hair in such a timid fashion you practically have to grind it against your skin.</li>
            <li> Not very strong for shaving down to the skin.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say about previous shavers we&#x27;ve purchased over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When using the trimmer, the only fix would be the hand placement on the razor itself because if you put your fingers in the wrong position, you are going to slide the height adjustment UP and go way too short on the setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is actually the same width as the less expensive 150.</li>
            <li> I manage to shave with a 3 blade disposable razor in less than 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> Guard broke on me after less than 3 years.</li>
            <li> Snapped in half where the button, guard, and cover meet, held together with the smallest dabs of plastic.</li>
            <li> Unlike the previous model I had, this one does not allow you to shave while recharging.</li>
            <li> However, it does all of the previously mentioned tasks sub-par.</li>
            <li> story short, this face shaver is not good at shaving faces.</li>
            <li> - The plastic attachments for beards, side burns, etc. seemed too finicky for me and not worth the trouble.  </li>
            <li> I have looked long and hard for a razer with these functions (and it was not easy to find) if you want a rechargable foil shaver with all the necessary functions, small size and small price, this is it.</li>
            <li> Shaving my neck took a little bit of time</li>
            <li> then any other electric shaver I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a little difficulty getting a trim anywhere</li>
            <li> That takes a little work to get around, but is doable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend this little beauty without reservation.</li>
            <li> the weight is lighter a little bit noise .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of whiskers or facial hair and it grows very slowly</li>
            <li> IT IS A WASTE OF $80.</li>
            <li> but I think it wont be a problem in a few days or weeks.</li>
            <li> Stubble was left behind and I ended up finishing with a hand held razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, the attachments are not easily available.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> But now my battery life gets wasted on the shaver blades</li>
            <li> Hopefully he will soon get use to it and it wont be wasted money</li>
            <li> Now no more cleaning up all the little hairs around the sink, you just rinse them down the shower drain!  </li>
            <li> In the past, I used the Cruzer 5, but really got tired of its poor value.  </li>
            <li> Also, It is not easy to determine how to adjust trimming depth just by looking at trimmer attachment in relation to the trimmer bar.  </li>
            <li> The razor itself is no significant improvement over my past electric razors, and I&#x27;ve tried both foil and rotary ones.</li>
            <li> I find that it misses some areas pretty badly</li>
            <li> not nearly as good as a braun shaver, but for half the price or less</li>
            <li> It leaves my face super-patchy and absolutely raw after marathon shave sessions that just leave me using a disposable razor.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time dinging an item all the way down to one star (which is what I would give it based solely on my experience) when I&#x27;m not sure if it is just a faulty device or  not.</li>
            <li> The charger base doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of real-estate in my bathroom and charges quickly.</li>
            <li> Adjustable comb found broken, such a poor quality wasn&#x27;t expected at BRAUN, at least.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is past the time in which I can return them for a refund.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a norelco and a panasonic shaver in the past</li>
            <li> I have been using it for past 5 days.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I know I&#x27;m only adding my voice to a chorus here,</li>
            <li> Something that does everything usually does nothing well.  </li>
            <li> the past six month, every time i tried shaving with it, ive had to shave after it with a razor.</li>
            <li> This one was a Christmas gift; I&#x27;m not sure if I would have chosen it for myself.  </li>
            <li> Got this because I&#x27;ve been a fan of some of Braun&#x27;s shavers in the past.</li>
            <li> The smaller head allows him to get into difficult places -</li>
            <li> husband has been using this razor for a few weeks now and loves it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shaver - it didn&#x27;t shave at all (ZERO); Trimmer - was too small, as its 3 in 1</li>
            <li> This product was a complete disappointment, my beard is coarse and this shaver was completely useless.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure who they tested this on</li>
            <li> hate to say it, but it doesn&#x27;t shave very well at all - and that&#x27;s at least half of</li>
            <li> I plan on getting the Braun cruZer 6 to trim up some of the finer lines on my goatee that are hard to do with the attachments on this razor.</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t had any problems with diminishing battery life, dull blades, anything breaking off----something</li>
            <li> According to my husband, it&#x27;s hard to go from blades to electric.  </li>
            <li> If you want to avoid the same disappointment as I have, then purchase a WAHL.</li>
            <li> I tested 1 day, 2 day, 3 day and 5 day periods in between shaving (cutting the 5 day back with the Cruzer trimmer before shaving).  </li>
            <li> at least, I wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> but, i thought at least the trimmer does well.  </li>
            <li> but when I need a close shave I end up just using a disposable because the razor on this sucks for a close shave.</li>
            <li> I have a fairly thick beard when I grow it</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY DO NOT PURCHASE THIS SHAVER!!!!!</li>
            <li> , ABSOLUTELY DO NOT PURCHASE THIS SHAVER!!!!!</li>
            <li> (Again, is it possible to cut it shorter somehow, or is it just plainly impossible?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because of the bad reviews on the shaver, I bought the series 790 at the same time, but it&#x27;s not here yet, so I haven&#x27;t had the chance to try it out.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is not good at all.</li>
            <li> In fact its rather hard on my face!</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have to press hard to get a close shave!</li>
            <li> But one of the shaving guides got loose, and when I tried to get a replacement, it is impossible to contact the company.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely disappointed that a brand name like BRAUN would release such a PIECE OF TRASH like this, with their brand name on it.</li>
            <li> Do not buy if you have a MANLY BEARD to tough for weak shavers.</li>
            <li> i used this on my head and face and it does a goodjob, but i have really tough beard and hair.  </li>
            <li> it got really frustrating that i no longer use</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m at a point where I&#x27;m confused.  </li>
            <li> The foil style and the cutting tool had a lot of trouble with my course beard/chin area</li>
            <li> That poor quality of comb has taken away 4 stars.</li>
            <li> All I wanted was a replacement for the broken attachment, which can be seen on their website here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...</li>
            <li> The detail trimmer also has trouble cutting my beard for shaping.</li>
            <li> Not happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Not sure if its the grilles design or the clearance between this and the cutting blade.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying this</li>
            <li> He said it doesn&#x27;t hurt, but feels weird.</li>
            <li> My husband is not impressed with this razor.        </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> It fails at that.  </li>
            <li> the precision trimmers ( both sizes ) are also completely useless ??</li>
            <li> but it definitely FAILED to deliver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I found the shave to be rather stubbly and uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Fail.  </li>
            <li> Fail.  </li>
            <li> Fail.  </li>
            <li> Its difficult for him to trim the way he likes.</li>
            <li> Terrible for the neck if you try to trim or line facial hair.</li>
            <li> he saw the Braun Cruzer Face, he was a bit skeptical that it would take the place of his 3-head.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after two months of using the shaver about three times a week</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it was awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> foil shaver is useless on any growth beyond about 2 days.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about the Braun Cruzer.  </li>
            <li> Well sad to say after trying it repeatedly, it doesn&#x27;t come close to the shave quality that was emphasized.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed by the reviews but</li>
            <li> At the beginning it&#x27;s a bit difficult to shave, but with time you will get used to it</li>
            <li> so i didnt care to find out it was almost useless.</li>
            <li> But you don&#x27;t need an expensive electric shave for that.  </li>
            <li> but I am simply sick and tired of having my face ripped up.  </li>
            <li> If I shave my face twice a week with the Gillette Sensor Excell razor, I will get dark colored, irritated skin and break out in nasty bumps.</li>
            <li> it might have fancy options likes eyesbrows cutting and all</li>
            <li> Basically a pointlessly ineffective \\&quot;perk\\&quot; on this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very disappointed in this shaver.</li>
            <li> The worst money ever spent !!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Until now I haven&#x27;t figured out if this TERRIBLE for shaving or if I&#x27;m doing something wrong (and, yes, it should be difficult to go wrong with just shaving).</li>
            <li> I am sad to say that this shaving machine is absolutely USELESS... !!</li>
            <li> Its very difficult to achieve a close shave.</li>
            <li> this one is bad at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Bad:  </li>
            <li> I always feel bad when I use it, though.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s quite bad if you want stubble.</li>
            <li> The plastic on the thingi that control the length is so bad .</li>
            <li> but I was beyond disappointed with this thing and something pushed me to share my experience...</li>
            <li> He looked and looked at dept. stores for a replacement and was disappointed that he could not find it.  </li>
            <li> but I am quite disappointed that the Cruzer does not catch some longer hairs under the chin</li>
            <li> Broke in 3 months... :-(</li>
            <li> I find it really annoying having all those pieces lying around loose.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the cord option as the base stand is not needed, though it won&#x27;t let you use it while it&#x27;s charging.</li>
            <li> the comb, the attachment base that clips to the shaver, and the adjustment slider.  </li>
            <li> , I think it sounds horrible.</li>
            <li> does not do anything that they claims it does the worst product out there when it comes to shaving....</li>
            <li> it does a miserable job as a trimmer, and it refuses to shave me well too.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a terrible shaver!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Thanks for that it awsome and it right time thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li> The plastic piece that pops out for trimming broke within the first week. Having purchased Braun products before, I was surprised as their quality is usually so good. I guess you get what you pay for. Don&#x27;t bother with this one.</li>
            <li> Perfect conditions!!! The Shaver really met my expectations!&lt;br /&gt;So far up to now, it didn&#x27;t let me down for sure!</li>
            <li> Procter &amp; Gamble really dropped the ball on this product.. It is cheaply made and takes twice as long to save with this shaver</li>
            <li> i used this on my head and face and it does a goodjob, but i have really tough beard and hair.  it gets close enough so that when i use a razor on me head i don&#x27;t have very much stubble</li>
            <li> I just recently bought this and used it for the 1st time last night. It works great! It trimmed my goatee very well and did a great job on my body hair. I won&#x27;t use it to actually shave my face with, since I prefer using a non-electric razor on my face since I have real sensitive skin. I like the fact that it charges very quickly, unlike my Norelco grooming shaver that I had that would take a whole day to charge. I like that there&#x27;s not a mess of attachments to clutter my bathroom up with and that everything is right there on the razor. I plan on getting the Braun cruZer 6 to trim up some of the finer lines on my goatee that are hard to do with the attachments on this razor.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY DO NOT PURCHASE THIS SHAVER!!!!! I purchased two of these in October 2011. Both of these shavers have fallen apart without being dropped. Unfortunately it is past the time in which I can return them for a refund. I am absolutely disappointed that a brand name like BRAUN would release such a PIECE OF TRASH like this, with their brand name on it. If you want to avoid the same disappointment as I have, then purchase a WAHL. I plan to purchase the WAHL 5 Star shaver, something I should have done from the beginning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AGAIN, ABSOLUTELY DO NOT PURCHASE THIS SHAVER!!!!! IT IS A WASTE OF $80. You&#x27;ll be throwing your hard earned money in the trash, which is exactly what I had to do.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying this but I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase. It gave me a good close shave. Shaving my neck took a little bit of time but I think it wont be a problem in a few days or weeks. I&#x27;ve been told that your skin needs to get used to the shaver in order to get a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 11/01/11: This shaver is awesome! If you&#x27;re looking for a good priced shaver, this is the one. I&#x27;ve owned a norelco and a panasonic shaver in the past it caused skin rash and missed a lot of hair. After 3 days, I was able to do a clean shave within 2 minutes and my face looks as if I used a razor to shave.</li>
            <li> very happy with this product. Comparable and even better then any other electric shaver I have used in the past. I have been using it for past 5 days. I will update my impression after a month of usage.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the versatility of this razor! He has had just the 3 circle foil razors for years and wanted something that could do more. The trimming parts of this razor work great. The foil trimmer he has complained about and to be honest, I think it sounds horrible. He said it doesn&#x27;t hurt, but feels weird. I think it sounds like it hurts, but he says it doesn&#x27;t. It does work well besides the noise though. I was disappointed that my local walmart carried it for $5 less though, but Amazon&#x27;s service is worth it. Overall, very good versatile razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this a few months now (from Vine, obviously), and I pretty much gave up using it as a shaver after the second try; it just left too much of a mess behind on my face, and I&#x27;m fairly certain I could&#x27;ve moved it around my face for a good hour and little visible difference from my pre-shave condition. The trimmer feature on this unit, however, is FANTASTIC; uniform trimming and shaping every time. The rotatable, retractable trimmer still works beautifully after several months of ownership, and use in and out of the shower (another feature I love!).  Unfortunately, I know I&#x27;m only adding my voice to a chorus here, but I simply can&#x27;t recommend this Cruzer because half of what it purports to do--arguably the more important half--it doesn&#x27;t really do.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a replacement for my last Cruzer 6 after it died of old age. Alas, the new one gets hot while charging which means it&#x27;s been sitting in a box for years and the batteries are about to stop working. Oh, well, I&#x27;ve kept the box and will be able to send it back when it refuses to charge at all, which I suspect won&#x27;t be long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy about Braun shaving products so far. Have had this for over a year now, and my husband loves it. We haven&#x27;t had any problems with diminishing battery life, dull blades, anything breaking off----something I can&#x27;t say about previous shavers we&#x27;ve purchased over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have even borrowed it (not for my face, obviously) and it doesn&#x27;t bite my skin. So many shavers are just not that great but this one is a workhorse. I never worry if we go on a trip and I forgot to pack my razors!</li>
            <li> Leave it to Braun to combine all the Electric Cutlery needed for the man who likes to grow a beard or van dyke or just a mustache and take care of it with one tool that will do it all from shaving to artistically trimming. Braun quality to boot.  It comes with all the accesories you&#x27;ll need to get that salon trim to your facial hair and it&#x27;s built sturdy to last with the added bonus of being waterproof so you can shave in the shower on those mornings you have to cut those extra minutes down.  If you just want to put the beard and mustache attachments aside and use it for a straight razor when the wife has laid down the law and the facial hair had to go...for now anyway...then it&#x27;s a wonderful shaver in it&#x27;s own right.  The perfect gift for the bearded one or the guy who can&#x27;t decide and sometimes sports a whisker or two and other times goes smoothed faced.  I heartily recommend it and I have used it to trim my van dyke personally.  It did the job as well as I can with razor and scissors and cut the time in thirds.  Good price too.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty versatile product.  Beard trimmer (or sideburns for me) works well, and I like that it can be used in the shower too.  However, it didn&#x27;t shave as close as the old traditional razor and shaving cream, and I found it a bit more irritating on the skin too.  So I&#x27;ll be sticking with the old-school method.  That said, if you already use electric, this is a nice product with no obvious drawbacks to me.</li>
            <li> When my wife first put the shaver on my lap I thought I wasn&#x27;t going to like it.  Something that does everything usually does nothing well.  I&#x27;ve come around to liking it.  I have a trimmed beard that I used a regular beard trimmer on.  With a little practice the Cruzer 6 beats the regular trimmer.  I use the large cutting edge to trim the main part of my beard and the small edge to get to the hard to trim places.  The electric razor is excellent for a quick upkeep on the clean shaven part of my face although I still use blade razor if I want a smooth shave.  The only problem I have with the Cruzer is, when following the directions to go against the grain, it trims my beard too close even on the highest setting.  I&#x27;ve learned to go with the grain and then track down the occasional long hair that is missed. All in all, a good product that I now use regularly.</li>
            <li> There are quite a few of these grooming sets on the market, so you need to spend a little time choosing the one that is right for you.  This unit is particularly useful if you have a full beard, as the trimmers have comb attachments for beard trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a small, light, well-designed unit.  As a shaver, it works no better or worse than the average foil shaver, which is good enough for most men who shave every day.  The way the two trimmers can be swiveled and slid into place is very convenient.  The lack of holder spaces for the attachments is not so good, so I have deducted a star for that.  I find it really annoying having all those pieces lying around loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is good for a shaver, at half an hour between charges. It is waterproof, so you can rinse it clean, or even use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> The Braun Cruzer 6 is a shaver plus beard/mustache trimmer. It works as one would anticipate - although the shave is nowhere near as close as a wet Gillette shave. However, for travel where the shaving foam container is yet another item to add to the TSA  toiletry bag, this is a convenient item. The trimmers work much better than the shaver - be careful as you learn to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been skeptical of electric shavers since first having tried them many years ago with a different Braun foil shaver. The results with that shaver are similar to my experience with the newer Cruzer - okay in a pinch or for the weekend but definitely not the replacement to razor shaving.&lt;br /&gt;The positives of this shaver/trimmer are many. First, the Cruzer comes with a built-in rechargeable battery that is ready to go out of the box. A full charge will net you 30 minutes of shaving. The charger base doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of real-estate in my bathroom and charges quickly. The Cruzer itself seems sturdy and not too light or too heavy in hand. One trimmer is built into the back of the unit and swivels making some trimming jobs much easier than contorting your hand or wrist. But perhaps best of all is that this trimmer is usable in the shower and the trimmer heads can be cleaned under the faucet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negatives, however, keep me from rating this product higher. First, as a shaver the Cruzer leaves a lot to be desired. After a full days growth this trimmer performs moderately well but nowhere close to shaving with a razor. In my experience I had to spend nearly 20 minutes making pass after pass from as many different angles as I could. The result looked alright but felt patchy with the touch test. Probably okay for light duty or weekend use but not part of my regular line-up when being clean-shaven is important. The other problem with making repeated passes with the shaver is skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The built-in trimmer on the back of the Cruzer worked well on my sideburns. However, the attachment for the 3-day beard is just a plastic clip the fits over the foil shaver. Here again to get the desired results required repeated multiple passes over the area I wanted trimmed.&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is an average performer. Results will vary and that&#x27;s expected but for me this wouldn&#x27;t be a recommended product.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his new shaver.  He has never liked electric shavers as they always left stubble or gave him a slight rash.  This does neither.  He have shaved completely as well as played with different types of beard styles.  It&#x27;s easy to clean and charges nicely.  Would recommend to friends or buy as a gift.</li>
            <li> Great electric razor, best I have had in years.  The only issue is it is a little loud, but wakes you up in the morning.</li>
            <li> This is a decent shaver if you want a close shave. I would not recommend for trimming beards longer than 1\\&quot;. Has nice attachments and looks great.</li>
            <li> My husband is not impressed with this razor.        He likes that it is light and ergonomically designed.  He said it feels like it&#x27;s well made.     He does not like that it is very loud, and he says it does not give a good shave if you let your facial hair get very long -- in other words, if he doesn&#x27;t shave every day, it does not work well.  His Norelco has no problem with 2 or 3 day beards, but this razor just can&#x27;t handle it.       The trim features work \\&quot;adequately\\&quot; in his book - but not well enough to get him to put aside his Norelco.</li>
            <li> The razor itself looks cool and runs great. For a rechargeable, lots of power all through your shave and any trimming you need...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate to say it, but it doesn&#x27;t shave very well at all - and that&#x27;s at least half of why you&#x27;d buy this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer however runs awesome and actually works better than most I&#x27;ve tried. When using the trimmer, the only fix would be the hand placement on the razor itself because if you put your fingers in the wrong position, you are going to slide the height adjustment UP and go way too short on the setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they could get the criss-cross foil shaver head to work as well as a 3-head Norelco and design a slightly different hand position to prevent that inadvertent change of height adjustment, there would be no competition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as designing a good combo shaver/trimmer razor, the folks at Braun are half way there.</li>
            <li> it does not cut real close. within 12 hours you need another shave. my last braun shaver I could go for 24 hours or more between shaves.</li>
            <li> great item, fantastic to use for the body as well as for the face.&lt;br /&gt;it comes with great tools and it&#x27;s very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;i really recommend this item!</li>
            <li> i have had this shaver for a few month now and it is pretty aweful. at first i thought it was because my skin needed time to get used to it but after the first month it was still not shaving properly.&lt;br /&gt;in the past six month, every time i tried shaving with it, ive had to shave after it with a razor. it would shave some spots while leaving others untouched. it got really frustrating that i no longer use it.&lt;br /&gt;dont buy this product</li>
            <li> braun is my first face shaver from braun  it is really good and shaving good  thank you braun and thank you amazon ^_^</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve ever used an electric shaver, it took me a few shaves to get the technique to get a clean shave without irritating my skin. Still causes light irritation and to get a clean shave it takes a while, will stick with it for a while and see if its the lack of experience from the user or the product just ain&#x27;t that great. I probably would&#x27;ve stuck with my normal shaver as it does a better clean shave, for people who like to have a trimmed or light shave look this will work fine.</li>
            <li> when you switch the combs between 1-2-3 it slips from 2-3 or 1-2... and over time it is just not useable because it now runs free and it is not adjustable anymore.... else I love the shaver.</li>
            <li> After I received this razor, I went to check reviews to see if others were having the same issues I am and was surprised to see that, no, they weren&#x27;t.  Like some other reviewers, I&#x27;m a girl and was hoping it would work to shave my legs and I also loved some of the features to do things like trim sideburns because my 4 year old son often needs his hair trimmed up on the back of his neck and around the sideburn area before he really needs a whole haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to use the razor on my legs first and it didn&#x27;t cut any hair off at all.  I figured maybe it didn&#x27;t just because it wasn&#x27;t really indended for that and kind of let it go.  I then used the piece on the side that is for sideburns to try to shape eyebrows.  Again, it didn&#x27;t really cut any hair off.  At this point I was still telling myself that it the razor was designed for a man&#x27;s facial hair and for sideburns and I really couldn&#x27;t rate it down if I wasn&#x27;t using it as intended.  So, I called in my son.  Same thing.  After about 10 swipes, maybe 1/3 of the hair had been cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;m at a point where I&#x27;m confused.  The other reviews are great, even from women using it to cut the hair on their legs and other non-intended uses.  I&#x27;m left wondering if maybe the one I got was just a dud.  I know it happens when things are mass produced.  I can&#x27;t imagine there would be all these great reviews if people were having the same experience I did.  So, I gave it three stars.  I have a hard time dinging an item all the way down to one star (which is what I would give it based solely on my experience) when I&#x27;m not sure if it is just a faulty device or  not.</li>
            <li> For whatever reason, this doesn&#x27;t give a close shave. I went over and over my husband&#x27;s 5 o&#x27;clock shadow and it did nothing. His old clippers that he&#x27;s had for years is able to give a closer shave than this. It just doesn&#x27;t cut it (no pun intended). Just like another reviewer, I tried to use it on my legs-nothing. We even tried using the smaller trimmer that is on the side and there was really no difference. Initially, I thought that maybe you need a heap of hair to use this shaver effectively but I don&#x27;t think you will ever achieve a clean shave with this product.</li>
            <li> I got this for my son.  When I asked him what he thought of it this is what he said.  \\&quot;Comfortable shave with minimal tug &amp; pull, but not very effective razor.  Took far too long to finish shaving. I&#x27;m sticking with blades...\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;  He&#x27;s been a blade man for a long time.  According to my husband, it&#x27;s hard to go from blades to electric.  I&#x27;ll take his word for it.</li>
            <li> I like this trimmer! Use it every day to trim my beard. Great for detailing.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor and I&#x27;m not very impressed with the way it shaves. The beard trimmer on it though is pretty good. Being a machinist I notice when something is well designed and made well. The beard trimmer has a nicely designed method of adjusting its cutting length giving you several different length settings. A simple twist and you can switch to the smaller trimmer head for trimming your mustache and other detail trimming. It has only the one snap on head to trim to a even length that&#x27;s just right for my mustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the foil razor part of it I&#x27;m not impressed at all. I don&#x27;t have a lot of whiskers or facial hair and it grows very slowly so I usually only need to shave about once a week. But the foil head on this razor doesn&#x27;t work very well or hardly at all on whiskers that are about an eighth of an inch long or a little longer. And using the trimmer head to shorten them enough so that the foil will shave them doesn&#x27;t work very well either. In fact its rather hard on my face! I suppose that if you shaved every day or don&#x27;t let the whiskers get more than 1/32 of an inch long then it might shave better. But for me even when I use it before my whiskers have more than 1/32 of an inch growth it still doesn&#x27;t shave very well and I have to go over my face slowly and repeatedly several times taking several minutes longer to shave than the plain triple blade disposable I&#x27;ve used for years. With the disposable razor I can get a lot closer shave in a lot less time so the electric foil shaver just isn&#x27;t worth it. It takes longer and I still have to use the disposable razor to get what this electric misses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall I can only give this a two star rating. One for the foil head and 4 for the trimmer.</li>
            <li> As electric razors go, this is about as versitile as you are going to get. Its chargable, and the charge seems to last awhile. Yes, you CAN go into the shower and use the razor, without getting zapped. (Assuming you just use battery power.) IT works on the face as well as any electric shaver goes, and has LOTS OF VERSITILITY. FOr example, if you want that 3 day stubble look, you&#x27;d never be able to get that with a straight razor, without waiting 3 days after you shave. But here, you just clip on one of the grooming combs over the shaving head. There are more attachments and gizmos here, to get your beard to be perfectly groomed, than you can imagine. My big question, was if I could also use it on my hair, cos I like short, nearly shaved hair on my head. Yes, I was able to use it for my head as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you wish, just use the blue clip, and the snap up shaver, and you can get that very short hair look, and also clean up around the neck, etc. There are three shaving razor heads. First, the face shaver, that works like all electric shavers have since they&#x27;ve been around. This piece you see on the front, is an electric shaving head, that slips up into the blue \\&quot;comb\\&quot;, allows four lenghts for beard or hair trimming. If you swing it around, you can groom your eyebrows, if they look too werewolf for your liking. There&#x27;s also a clear plastic clip, for the large (face) shaving head. This is also for the beard. Lots of options, for getting the job done. Since it worked so well clipping my head hair short, I wondered if maybe you could groom your body hair as well. No. If you need to do that, you will probibly need to buy the other razor BRAUN sells for that job. This BRAUN shaver kit really DOES come with everything...the charging dock, the little brush to clean up the shaving head, all the various clipping heads, so you can adjust the lenght of the cut, oil for the blades if they get sticky, and the little grooming clip for clipping too bushy eyebrows.  In fact, even tho you get a plain blue cardboard box to keep these barber supplies together, you will probibly want to buy a more durable plastic box. The BRAUN CRUZER 6 FACE SHAVER does everything it promises, and even more. Its well designed, and for having 3 cutting heads, three plastic clips (one which is adjustable to 4 lenghts), its really easy to use. However, one thing: if you are buying this for your boyfriend/husband, make SURE he likes electric razors. Some guys just cant get used to holding the electric razors at perfect right angles to their face, or their hair doesnt cut as well with these, as with regular razor blades. Its all but nessacary for beard grooming, tho, unless you want to play around with scissors for an hour.ou get a plain blue cardboard box to keep these barber supplies together, you will probibly want to buy a more durable plastic box.

            <li> Is it&#x27;s a work of art. It is gorgeous. As far as it&#x27;s performance... It&#x27;s pretty average. Would make a great travel razor I think since it does so many things.</li>
            <li> What Braun has here is a good quality (4 star) foil shaver with a nice stand and charging system.  But, they decided to load up the package with cheapo plastic guides and this hood type structure to make it more of a \\&quot;multi-use\\&quot; face shaver.  It fails at that.  The foils don&#x27;t like longer hairs.  You will need a real honest trimmer to handle the tougher full beard and goatee duties- this one is bad at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is quite good at simply shaving your face clean, but then again most electric razors can do that as well.  So its a good foil shaver- if you are looking for that, its in the mix.  If you want it for other beard/goatee/trimming stuff, go ahead and pass on this one.</li>
            <li> I have used Braun shavers for many years. My last shaver was a model 150, which, aside from the trimmer attachment on the Cruzer, seems very similar. The product description states the the Cruzer has an extra wide shave head. It is actually the same width as the less expensive 150. They both shave similarly. A nice feature on the Cruzer is the wet cleaner under a stream of water; it is less messy than removing the head and brushing off the cutting bar. But then, the cheaper 150 has that same feature.   Regarding shaving performance, it is only okay. I find that I need to pass over an area repeatedly, which in my experience causes increased wear on the foil head. As for the trimming capability, a dedicated trimmer would be a much better proposition. Also, It is not easy to determine how to adjust trimming depth just by looking at trimmer attachment in relation to the trimmer bar.  So, Unless you desire a combined shaver/ trimmer, pass on this one and buy a less expensive model shaver and a more capable trimmer.</li>
            <li> Good shaver, not as close a shave as my old braun with dual shaving heads but good enough for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this braun shaver; however, i didn&#x27;t like its clean shave. If you need it for clean shave, I think you must go for another one. I must say that its trimmers are good enough.</li>
            <li> I am sad to say that this shaving machine is absolutely USELESS... !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;what I am about to write concerns dudes with thick coarse beards, like myself...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys, I kept going back and fourth against and with the grain of my beard, as instructed in the manual... kept it at a 90 Degree angle but no go...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does nothing... the precision trimmers ( both sizes ) are also completely useless ??....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;maybe I got a faulty unit? I don&#x27;t know... All I can is... this machine is not for guys with full thick beards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The marketing behind it was cool and all but it definitely FAILED to deliver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d just like to point out that it is highly unlike myself to sit here and write about a product but I was beyond disappointed with this thing and something pushed me to share my experience...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this razor.  He has been a Braun fan for years and had this razor for many years before he dropped and broke it.  He looked and looked at dept. stores for a replacement and was disappointed that he could not find it.  I looked on Amazon.com, found the razor and my husband was a happy camper when he opened up his package on Christmas morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a number of beard trimmers and clippers over the years with varying degrees of satisfaction. This one was a Christmas gift; I&#x27;m not sure if I would have chosen it for myself.  The Good:  -The trimmer blades (both the wide one and the narrow precision one) cut pretty well. It&#x27;s easy to cut down a grown-out beard before wet shaving or to shape up an outline.  -Lightweight, easy to grip  -cordless with decent battery life  The Bad:  -The length guide for the trimmer is flimsy. I&#x27;ve been trimming at the longest setting and had it collapse down to the shortest setting without warning. It turns the intended trimming/shaping operation into the need for a full shave.  -The length guide for the trimmer greatly reduces the effectiveness of the cutting blades-- It takes multiple passes from all angles to cut the hairs to an even length.  -Did I mention the length guide is flimsy? I dropped the trimmer on the counter today and the guide broke into 3 pieces. They can&#x27;t be reassembled because the pieces were glued together, without mechanical fasteners. Furthermore, I&#x27;ve been shopping for a replacement. None to be found. Braun&#x27;s website lists a part number for it, but they do not sell their parts directly. Both of the distributors they list do not stock the part. I haven&#x27;t found it anywhere else online, either.  -The foil shaver head, as other reviewers have mentioned, is USELESS on coarse facial hair.  Overall:  If I can find the part I need, I may keep using this as a shaper/trimmer, but it is impossible to shave cleanly with. If I can&#x27;t find the part, no way am I buying another product in the Cruzer line; I&#x27;ll go back to my $20 Remington that has lasted 5 years.</li>
            <li> The Braun Cruzer 6 Face is a handy trimmer/shaver, but if you have a course beard, it does take a bit to get a close shave.  It is a handy shaver that fits well in the hand, and it comes with some good trimmer features.  There is a wide trimmer and a narrow trimmer, as well as a couple of comb attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It charges fast, and comes with a charging stand.  The cord detaches and you can use the trimmer/shaver in the shower.  This is a nice feature.  You can also clean it easily with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the features I have not used yet.  I basically used the trimmer by my sideburns and then the foil shaver to shave.  It does provide a smooth shave, but you have to work at it a bit, especially with my course beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had better luck with blades, but sometimes having an electric shaver is very convenient.  That is what this is.  I like it, and will continue to use it when I want a quick dry shave.</li>
            <li> Good for a trimmer, that&#x27;s it. The foil shaver is worse than a month old disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re rocking a beard and mustache like me, here is my advice. Buy a trimmer instead and use something else to clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To clean shave some areas I&#x27;m still using my 5 year old series 3 380.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would only recommend this to a 15 year old.</li>
            <li> This is a good, versatile, electric razor/trimmer.  I bought it primarily as a goatee/mustache trimmer as I use a razor for normal shaving, however I&#x27;ve used it for close shaving as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer works quite well.  The adjustable guard feels flimsy when you move it, but it holds great when you trimming.  The cut is quick, it takes only a few passes to trim all the hair - my facial hair tends to lie down, the passes are needed to catch everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guard is very comfortable, the cut is accurate.  There&#x27;s a little difficulty getting a trim anywhere you can&#x27;t get a full sweeping stroke, such as under the nose, because of the shape of the guard.  That takes a little work to get around, but is doable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor portion is probably average for its class.  I&#x27;ve not used an electric razor in years so I found the shave to be rather stubbly and uncomfortable.  Your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li> Love it , very cool , strong , powerful&lt;br /&gt;And seller is good too</li>
            <li> I actually own a Series 7 Braun shaver and bought this Cruzer only as a \\&quot;travel shaver\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I realize that the foil shaver can&#x27;t be as thorough as the sophisticated Series 7 shaver but I am quite disappointed that the Cruzer does not catch some longer hairs under the chin and it also misses slightly longer hairs at the side of the face.&lt;br /&gt;By the way I shave on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;It does seem to do better under the shower.</li>
            <li> I love Braun products and needed a trimmer that can also do my neck and cheeks. So basically I needed an all-in one that wouldn&#x27;t break if I got it wet. This has delivered. It doesn&#x27;t shave anywhere near as comfortable as the 7-9 series but it&#x27;s manageable and easy. Mine seems to fully charge within an hour and will run for probably an hour during use. The trimmer gets close and is fairly comfortable to use (also easier than the higher end ones I use because it slides up instead of out so I can see what i&#x27;m doing), I don&#x27;t use the smaller one too much. The foil shaver isn&#x27;t as smooth as Braun&#x27;s higher models but that&#x27;s to be expected. It also causes slight irritation of my cheeks and neck after using it for a couple of days straight (I have thick hair) so I take a couple of days break between uses. If I needed it to shave my entire face I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for thicker hair because it does pull/bog down on just my cheeks so I&#x27;d suggest getting a higher end model.</li>
            <li> my wife purchased this for me for fathers day and it works great!  best one I&#x27;ve ever had.  The attachments work nicely and cleanly.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. Does everything as advertised. Still going strong and couldn&#x27;t be more happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s pretty unrealistic to buy an electric shaver and expect a shave as good as a razor. That being said, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re out there, but they&#x27;re not going to be in this price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does exactly what I want it to do! I run the beard trimmer (not the foil trimmer) over my face to create a stubble look. It does this very well. I can&#x27;t really comment on the foil aspect of it, but I ran it across my face and it was comfortable! No tugging and pulling as I experienced with my last shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I bought it with all of the other options on the shelf was the product design. It feels great in your hand and it&#x27;s a lot smaller than competitive products. This is good for me because I live in a dorm and I can&#x27;t just leave things out on the counter- it has to go back in my bag when I&#x27;m done with it. I always feel bad when I use it, though. I have 8am classes and it&#x27;s not the most quiet shaver out there by any means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does great for pubic regions with the adjustable trimmer. I&#x27;m hesitant to use it in the shower only because it&#x27;s electric and that kind of stuff freaks me out, but apparently it&#x27;s do-able! However, it&#x27;s nice that I can just run it under water to rinse all of the hairs off of it. My last one was a mess and got hair all over my bag when I put it up- who has time to brush their shavers after every use!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the money and my needs, I don&#x27;t think I could have bought anything better!</li>
            <li> For the last 2 weeks I&#x27;ve been testing 3 shavers, the Panasonic ES-LA63-S, the Braun Series 7 760 Pulsonic, and this Braun Cruzer 6 Face.  I have always used a razor but I am simply sick and tired of having my face ripped up.  I&#x27;d say my beard is pretty average.  I tested 1 day, 2 day, 3 day and 5 day periods in between shaving (cutting the 5 day back with the Cruzer trimmer before shaving).  I shaved one side of my face with the Braun Series 7 Pulsonic and the other side with the Panasonic.  Bear with me here, I&#x27;ll get to the Cruzer 6 in a minute.  Shaving dry, the Panasonic is slightly, but noticeably, better than the Braun Series 7.  Overall, dry shaving with either of those two is good enough for me, and my four year old daughter, who has become my beard tester, pretty much says daddy doesn&#x27;t need a shave afterwords.  I rate the dry performance of these two roughly 87% to 90% of a razor shave.  Now here&#x27;s the surprise finding.  After doing the side by side with the Panasonic and the Braun Pulsonic Series 7, I&#x27;ve been cleaning up the stuff they don&#x27;t pick up with the Braun Cruzer.  Yup! I know what you&#x27;re thinking, \\&quot;Oh my lord, say it ain&#x27;t so\\&quot; - it is!  Not only does that little Cruzer 6 shave closer, but it is more comfortable.  The foil on the Cruzer is simply smoother riding along my face and there is absolutely no irritation.  None!  As soon as I start using it, I just say \\&quot;Ahhh\\&quot;.  It feels good.  The Cruzer is smaller,feels better in my hand, and easier to handle along the jaw line and under the nose, and costs a lot less than the Braun Series 7 Pulsonic and the Panasonic.  Also, the replacement foil and blades are half the price of the other two.  Lastly, it is worth mentioning a word or two about shaving wet with either the Panasonic or the Braun Cruzer (the more expensive Braun Pulsonic cannot be used wet).  Although I have not had a chance to use the Cruzer wet shaving, I did find that the Panasonic, with a little soap (I use a bit of shampoo because it&#x27;s slicker) is definitely better than dry shaving. I&#x27;d give the Panasonic a 95% to 97% compared to a razor, but with absolutely no irritation, cuts, nicks, or razor burn.  So there you go. One man&#x27;s opinion, and your mileage may vary, but I can say with the utmost certainty that I won&#x27;t be using a razor any more, and I&#x27;m glad I saved roughly $100 by skipping the higher priced offerings. If I&#x27;m able, I will amend this with my findings while wet shaving with  the Braun Cruzer 6.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Braun Cruzer for more than 5 years. This is my 3rd one. It is perfect to keep a 2/3 days beard thanks to its extra tools.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m low-maintenance when it comes to shaving the face these days; I largely let it grow and only shave my face clean once every few weeks, trimming and &#x27;cleaning up&#x27; the rest of the time (I don&#x27;t grow a heavy beard, so I never really reach &#x27;mountain man&#x27; status). My ideal shaver is one that lets me clean my neck and cheeks up, trim up my sideburns and eyebrows, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the third electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned, and I&#x27;m very impressed with its overall performance and versatility. I&#x27;ve noticed other reviewers mention that the foiled shaver itself isn&#x27;t quite as effective as they&#x27;d like, and I have to second this. In my experience, the key has always been to hit stubble before it gets very long, else the foil has a bit of trouble with the longer stubble. If I let mine grow for more than about three days, this has trouble with it. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a weakness of the Cruzer6 so much as it is a weakness of the foiled-electric-shaver design generally; just know that you won&#x27;t be able to let yourself go for a week, then get clean-shaven, using only this device (or ANY electric shaver)- at least, I wasn&#x27;t. One notable design feature is that the shaving surface is extra-wide; very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the design and versatility of the Cruzer6 really go a long way to make up for this. There are two different sizes of trimmer built in to the razor itself, and that alone makes this a very attractive choice for a razor to take with you on the road, or to be able to use without having to fetch a bunch of other accessories, etc. The trimmers work beautifully, and their sizes and designs are perfect- just those two trimmers do pretty much everything I need, and I could almost see paying a fair sum for a device that did only what the two trimmers do. Having them built into my razor is a big bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of taking it on the road, the battery life is awesome. I&#x27;ve had mine for a few months already, and have only had to charge it up one time. One time! That&#x27;s using it weekly, too! Very impressive.&lt;br /&gt;Equally impressive is the fact that it has full waterproof functionality, which means one can use it in the shower, sink-rinse it, etc., which makes it hugely functional. In my opinion. Finally, it comes with a couple of trimming guards, so beard-guys are covered, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, while the shaver itself could be a little more effective, I suspect this is partly a function of the limits of electric razors in general. Overall, though, this is a versatile and convenient product with several design features that will appeal to guys who want a low-maintenance solution to shaving and grooming.too! Very impressive.

            <li> Great shaver. Great attachments. You can do your entire face with it. As smooth as it gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One problem I have with is that the attachment (pictured) has 3-4 different lenghts. It eventually just started sliding all the way to the lowest setting without putting any preasure on it.</li>
            <li> If this is anything like the cruzer 5, buyer beware, the cruzer 5 does not like to actually cut the hair without a number of passes back and forth in all directions</li>
            <li> Got this because I&#x27;ve been a fan of some of Braun&#x27;s shavers in the past. After having used I would heartily recommend looking elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, this face shaver is not good at shaving faces. It&#x27;s good at trimming beards and straightening up your sideburns, mustaches, etc, but it&#x27;s not good at getting you as nice, clean shave. And it&#x27;s quite bad if you want stubble. This foil razor gave me a patchy shave and I ultimately had to use a normal, non-electric razor to get a clean shave after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand it&#x27;s reasonably priced, and that it comes with a lot of cool-looking pieces of plastic, but it&#x27;s not a good electric razor by any measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally - If your beard is at all course this is not the tool for you. The foil style and the cutting tool had a lot of trouble with my course beard/chin area and it really cut poorly as a result. It took many passes for the hair to be removed and the Cruzer 6 is surprisingly loud so it wasn&#x27;t a pleasant experience while this was happening.</li>
            <li> Alright so got the product in yesterday and today decided to use it for the first time. The trimming tools are very handy especially when trying to clean up unwanted body hair, however, I was a little disappointed with the performance of the shaving head when set for a clean shave. I was expecting maybe taking a couple of minutes to shave but I spent 10-15mins go back and forth over my face. Now I rated this four stars because when I was finished the shave was very close and even though I have sensitive skin I didn&#x27;t break out all red. I also can&#x27;t mark it down as I have little experience with the proper technique with electric shavers. I will update again in a couple months. So to the punchline...Good shaver, great trimming tools, works great on thick dark hair, and the fact that its waterproof is a plus!! I would recommend this product to people interested in using an electric shaver!</li>
            <li> I bought this primarily for the trimmer aspect of it, which works OK.  The face shaver does not work at all, literally caused nothing but razor burn while leaving the stubble on my face.  If you are buying this and planning on using it to shave clean, look somewhere else.  The trimmer works pretty well so far, but not great, and with all of the other tools on the device it makes it slightly unwieldy.  The best feature of this in my opinion is the detail trimmer.  Not the most gentle, but good for harder to trim areas and actually works.  Stuck between a 2 and 3 star rating right now.  All I can say is that I would not purchase it again given the chance, but will make due with it since it&#x27;s too late to get my money back.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend bought this shaver for me for my birthday.  This is the only reason I&#x27;m still using it and haven&#x27;t gleefully thrown it off a high building in order to joyfully observe it smash into thousands of unusable pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, I&#x27;ve never come across any multi-use product that wasn&#x27;t effective at even one of its advertised features.  The Braun, however, succeeds at failing in every respect possible.  Trimming my beard neatly and efficiently? Fail.  Shaving cleanly? Fail.  Works in the shower? Fail.  Works dry?  Fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I think this shaver was either designed by someone who has no concept of what hair is, or, it&#x27;s meant for those baby-faced Swedish boy models you see in Ralph Lauren ads that have 3 soft baby hairs on their chin that they&#x27;ve never cut.  Unfortunately, I actually have facial hair; I suspect this is why this shaver is so ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally speaking, I find myself having to shave cleanly with my Mach 4 blade about 30% of the time after using this shaver; it&#x27;s diabolically poor.  I can&#x27;t wait to get in a fight with my girlfriend so I have an excuse to throw this thing in the bin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this razor now for almost a year. It has held up well and works exceptionally well in some areas and as best as can be expected in others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor features a trimmer section, which extends upward for use. It can be rotated 180° to use a 90° wide trimmer or a straight, narrow trimmer blade. It comes with a plastic guard attachment (as shown in the images), which can be fitted into about 3 positions for trimming at various lengths using the wide trimmer. The narrow trimmer is great for trimming a mustache along the lip line or other fine work. The trimmers and the length attachment work exceptionally well. Since the trimmers were the primary reason I got the razor in the first place, I&#x27;m well satisfied with this aspect of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor portion is about as good as I could expect. I haven&#x27;t used an electric in many years, but the same basic problem remains - they don&#x27;t really do a good job of shaving closely. First of all, if I skip shaving for a day, this won&#x27;t get the job done and I&#x27;ll have to use a blade and a can of foaming goo. Even on days of regular use I have to constantly go over an area at different angles to get it to cut reasonably well. I find that it misses some areas pretty badly and I&#x27;ll have to use the old fashioned, disposable, 4-blade razor to touch up after it. Still, it is faster than the water and foam method, so I use it most days. I just wish it worked better and more efficiently at getting a good close shave in one or two passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for cleaning, you can usually blow the blades clean after removing the blade screen. Every once in a while they may need a nice, soft, dry brush. You can clean this with water, but you&#x27;ll need to pay more attention to oiling the blades and all that nasty mess. I&#x27;ve kept mine in great shape just doing a dry clean after every use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, everyone&#x27;s beards vary. If yours are more stiff and you like using electric razors, this is an exceptional product that you will enjoy for a long time. If you have a less stiff beard and have had problems with electrics in the past, this won&#x27;t be very much different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It is a fantastic electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It is an electric razor.t that you will enjoy for a long time. If you have a less stiff beard and have had problems with electrics in the past, this won&#x27;t be very much different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It is a fantastic electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It is an electric razor.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband. One of the pieces broke immediately. Its difficult for him to trim the way he likes. He doesnt even use it anymore. I dont know why it has such good reviews.</li>
            <li> When used as a trimmer for the \\&quot;scruffy\\&quot; look, this is a great shaver.  When used as a close shaver, it may not be the best option for those with sensitive skin.  Or at least younger skin that hasn&#x27;t yet grown accustomed to regular shaving.  A minor breakout and a little discomfort may result - though if you have already been shaving regularly for a while, I doubt you&#x27;ll have much trouble.  The young one in  the family prefers it for grooming his facial fuzz rather than taking it down to a full shave.  His dad had no issues though he much prefers his [[ASIN:B003YJAZZ4 Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System, Silver]] for every day use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Build quality is extremely good.  As with most other Braun items we have used, the device is fully made in Germany with the only power cord originating in China.</li>
            <li> A lot of people seem to dislike the shaving portion of the braun cruzer. I think its OK, not the best though. The trimmer on the other hand is amazing, and the best you can find for the price. Also the product itself looks really good!</li>
            <li> The razor itself is no significant improvement over my past electric razors, and I&#x27;ve tried both foil and rotary ones. It doesn&#x27;t hurt to shave though, just isn&#x27;t extremely fast for me. I have found it works best if I use shaving cream, and that&#x27;s a feature not many foil shavers have. The main benefit is the goatee/ mustache trimmer. Since I have a goatee this is quite an improvement over anything else I used before, and much easier than getting out my Wahl clippers. Adequate range of lengths too. I like the cord option as the base stand is not needed, though it won&#x27;t let you use it while it&#x27;s charging. It can do a quick charge though, and doesn&#x27;t take too long to fully charge. I do charge it a couple times a week probably as it shaves better with a full charge, but battery life is not a drawback to me. I wish it came with a bag/case but I&#x27;m making do with an older one I still have.    - Update: 8 Months later I got tired of how long it takes to shave and found a Remington 5800 that was a big improvement. I still really like the Braun for it&#x27;s trimming combs, does much better on my goatee than my Wahl clippers, so for that alone it&#x27;s worth having. (proves that it&#x27;s just hard to do more than one thing well)</li>
            <li> I bought this as a travelling razor/trimmer and it works great! Not quite as close a shave as my Braun 7 Series home razor, but it&#x27;s close enough. It&#x27;s compact and has a quick charge feature that let&#x27;s you finish shaving if the unit loses it&#x27;s charge before you&#x27;re finished. It takes about two minutes for the quick charge. Very compact and easy to travel with. I recommend this little beauty without reservation.</li>
            <li> Great choice. Does all it says it does.  Excellent for trimming mustash and beard.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone looking for a good quality mustash &amp; beard trimmer&lt;br /&gt;that won&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would live up to half of the things it says it does and after having it a few weeks, some of them are better than others.  The shaver is ok - takes longer than a razor and gel and is not as close but ... you can take it with you and get a presentable shave on the go.  The trimmers work pretty well.  They trim close and have given no nicks so far.  The adjustable length options for the shaver top are where I ran into issues.  They do not offer much adjustment leaving no options for replacing a Wahl trimmer for short tight hair cuts.  All in all I would not purchase again - I would have gone with a Wahl trimmer instead.  It&#x27;s not terrible - just not my cup of tea.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric razor that I have ever used and so far I think I like it.&lt;br /&gt;For the price it can do many different things, such as generally shaving my face and neck, trimming my beard, and keeping my sideburns nice.&lt;br /&gt;It is very close shave on my face but on my neck it seems to miss more. But it is difficult to shave my completely smooth anyway with my regular razor. It does a much better job when I use it every day or every other day when my beard isn&#x27;t as long. I would still recommend shaving with just a regular razor once a week to catch everything that this razor missed.&lt;br /&gt;It is very comfortable to use on my face both wet and dry and is very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;The battery lasts for a very long time&lt;br /&gt;Overall I recommend it as a first electric razor.</li>
            <li> In the past, I used the Cruzer 5, but really got tired of its poor value.  So, I bought the Cruzer 6.  I am fairly satisfied with the razor, but I have a softer, light-colored beard.  Similar the Cruzer 5, the Cruzer 6 seems also to suffer from the \\&quot;needing to go over your face many times\\&quot; to get all the hairs syndrome, but it does not leave the red bumps like the Philips 2D model I used just once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the Cruzer 6 better than the Cruzer 5, because it seemed to operate at a higher seed (inside motor seemed to rotate faster), although it is a bit louder than a Philips/Norelco that I stopped using altogether.  Cruzer 6 also has a very useful charging stand (and small clear plastic shaving guard); however, other than that, these two Braun razors seem nearly identical.  So, I give it 4 stars to say that \\&quot;I like it\\&quot;, but still lacks great value and quality.  Still Made in (red) China - you get what you pay for...</li>
            <li> I really like being able to shave in the shower and it has great battery life but the plastic beard trimmer attachment broke when it fell a couple of feet to a tile floor. Quick fix with super glue and it works good as new but it wasn&#x27;t a long enough fall to do damage.</li>
            <li> Terrible for the neck if you try to trim or line facial hair. It&#x27;s a great tool to shape facial hair but if you want an all in one trimmer, look else wear. I think it&#x27;s overrated.</li>
            <li> I had one of the first generation Cruzer razors and accidentally dropped it while on a trip and the rotating trimmer broke off so I ordered this model.  It&#x27;s fairly similar to my first, which I liked, with some nice improvements  or enhancements.  I really like the Braun product line and this shaver is no exception.  It&#x27;s fairly compact for travel and is great for maintaining face, mustache and beard because of the various trimmer and shaver options - no need for several different trimmers - this one does it all.  The Cruzer 6  came with a charging stand and can also be charged just with the power cord for easy travel-- great add-on.  I wish there had been a travel case - recommend you also buy a travel case to protect it on trips - various cases can be found on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I only use to get closer after my razor shave... not good for getting down through beard (or even 5 o&#x27;clock shadow) down to skin in the first place</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Cruzer 6 for about a week and I like it.  I wear a goatee and this trimmer helps keep my old gray whiskers looking good.  It does a great job of trimmer my beard to keep the length where I want it.  It also does a nice job of maintaining cheek and neck lines looking sharp.  I only thing I&#x27;m having trouble with is finding a way to keep the whiskers just beneath my nose trimmed.  There may be, however, an attachment I just haven&#x27;t discovered yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve worn beards several times over the years, but never had such a nice tool for keeping them looking good.</li>
            <li> While this shaver has some nice features and has multiple applications, it did a poor job when it came to a clean shave. Compared to my husband&#x27;s other shaver, it covered a much smaller area of the face and required multiple times going over the same area to get a clean shave.  After two days of giving it a go, he went back to his more traditional Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> The worst money ever spent !!!! does not do anything that they claims it does the worst product out there when it comes to shaving.... It&#x27;s only getting one star because I have to or else I would put zero stars</li>
            <li> to fast shipping to Turkey, to beautiful machine. ty.</li>
            <li> I cant get a clean shave with. Doesnt matter how hard I try or how much a expand my skin of my face.</li>
            <li> Great shaver and a good price.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using a 3-head electric razor for more than 30 years because he has a extremely fast-growing, tough beard. It takes a lot of razor power to cut it; and, within hours, he has a shadow. So far, the 3-head has been the answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he saw the Braun Cruzer Face, he was a bit skeptical that it would take the place of his 3-head. However, after two shaves his 3-head went into the cabinet and the Braun Cruzer is now on the counter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He likes that it is lightweight, yet very efficient. The smaller head allows him to get into difficult places - the older you get the more \\&quot;difficult places\\&quot; you have - and the head cuts close without chaffing. The other feature he likes is the eyebrow attachment. It works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything else has been said by the other reviewers. The bottom line for us is that the Braun Cruzer Face does what it says it does. It comes highly recommended from my husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has been using this razor for a few weeks now and loves it! He says it gives a closer shave, and he loves the attachments, especially the wide and narrow trimmer. It definitely converted him from the rotary he was using. The only thing he says is on his wish list is a meter to show how much charge is left.</li>
            <li> Best electric shaver I have used. I have been a die-hard Norelco customer for a long time. Big difference! It&#x27;s great on trimming between eye brows with 1 mm trimmer, and the 28mm wide trimmer for side burns. The foil works great around the ears. It&#x27;s important to hold shaver at 90&#x27;angle, then you will get a real close shave without a burn. It&#x27;s easy to clean, just run under water. Holds a good charge. I can&#x27;t use the beard atachments, but the shaver is a great value with all the features it does have. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I gave this shaver/trimmer three weeks, or about 6 shaves and finally threw in the towel.  it does a miserable job as a trimmer, and it refuses to shave me well too.  Too bad, nice look and feel, but it just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my travels to Eastern Europe as it is also dual voltage and bettery operated...</li>
            <li> I was not a fan of this shaver. Stubble was left behind and I ended up finishing with a hand held razor. Spend your money elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Adjustable comb found broken, such a poor quality wasn&#x27;t expected at BRAUN, at least. That poor quality of comb has taken away 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I was originally impressed and happy with the CruZer6 Face shaver from Braun.  I very much liked the number of attachments it came with and versatility of the shaver.  Unfortunately, after two months of using the shaver about three times a week the beard comb attachment (the larger attachment with blue colored comb), which is the one I used most often broke.  The plastic cracked and separated where the comb attaches to the adjustment slider, resulting in the attachment breaking in three pieces: the comb, the attachment base that clips to the shaver, and the adjustment slider.  From here, things only got worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun does not make it easy to contact the company.  They have an online web site for submitting customer service requests, which is what I ended up doing.  All I wanted was a replacement for the broken attachment, which can be seen on their website here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]|xl|81327781_xl.jpg&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the attachments are not easily available.  I&#x27;ve not found a dealer which sells them and online retailers only seem to cary the accessories such as the foil and blades which are designed to be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun customer service did not want to send me the replacement attachment, and instead insisted I mail them the entire shaver with all attachments.  They said they would send me a mailing label and instructions in 3-6 weeks.  After 6 weeks, no mailing label arrived and I sent another email to follow up.  I received an apology email right away, they confirmed my mailing address, and said the mailing label and instructions would be sent immediately.  After another month, still nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is inexcusable.  A responsible company would have immediately shipped me a replacement attachment at no cost.  Instead, I&#x27;m nearly three months without the use of the razor.  On a brighter note, I&#x27;ve had to rely on my trusty Gillette Sensor Mach 3, which works wonderfully well and has never let me down.ach 3, which works wonderfully well and has never let me down.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver because i have a severely sensitive skin, now have absolutely no problem shaving several times a week, the shaver is versatile especially when yo have 1 week growth because you can use the cutting head then the shaving head. the other heads are very handy. totally recommended</li>
            <li> Well, if you have man beard, this machine is not useful, just do not shave ir well ...&lt;br /&gt;Another con is that the machine only work wireless. Do not work with the plug on.</li>
            <li> It is no worth to change the old Braun cruzer Shaver If you already have it. the weight is lighter a little bit noise . I love the new precision comb that use for eyebrow</li>
            <li> I have been using trimmers for almost 10 years.  Currently I am using Remmington&#x27;s and I thought to upgrade it to Braun 6 (3 in 1).  I was not at all expecting from the shaver after reading all the reviews but, i thought at least the trimmer does well.  Unfortunately, it was awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lesson to be learned \\&quot;Jack of all trades master of none??\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaver - it didn&#x27;t shave at all (ZERO); Trimmer - was too small, as its 3 in 1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please do not waste your time ordering and returning this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon service was Exceptional.</li>
            <li> Broke in 3 months... :-(</li>
            <li> It seemed like a great idea to get a combination shaver/trimmer that has a slick design and manufactured by Braun. Unfortunately, this just isn&#x27;t a very capable product. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s priced at 50 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foil shaver is useless on any growth beyond about 2 days. Even with less growth, it can take 20 minutes to do a complete, close shave, and that doesn&#x27;t include my upper lip or chin areas, as I keep a goatee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;wide trimmer\\&quot; on this model is extremely weak and cuts hair in such a timid fashion you practically have to grind it against your skin. Plan to do that often, because the foil shaver won&#x27;t work without first plowing over your face with the trimmer. Basically a pointlessly ineffective \\&quot;perk\\&quot; on this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very disappointed in this shaver. Moving on to something a little more expensive from Panasonic, hoping it goes well.</li>
            <li> 4 1/2 stars! This shaver has many pros and only a few cons. It is light weight and feels like someone designed it to fit in my hand. It takes a very short time for recharging and it is very powerful and holds a charge for a long time. More importantly it gives you a very close shave. I had some adjustment to getting use to this shaver at first. I had used a different Braun shaver previously to this one. That shaver required me to press harder against my face to feel a close shave. Upon trying the old one again while the new one was recharging, i realized it was hurting my face and didn&#x27;t give me anywhere near as close a shave as The Braun Cruzer 6.   The attachments work well but, took a little getting use to at first. They keep my sideburns nice and trimmed, the way i like them. The only real con i experienced was at the beginning. The top popped off a few times when using it near my chin and jaw line. That was was due to me being use to my old one and having to press so hard to try and get a close shave. That&#x27;s what is so great about this shaver...you don&#x27;t have to press hard to get a close shave! The head has a bit of a spring action to it, allowing you to get a really close shave and pain free!  I have a difficult face to shave as my whiskers grow out at angles on certain spots. I was very impressed with this shaver and enjoy using it!</li>
            <li> I was very happy when my fuzzy faced son asked for a beard trimmer for Christmas. I shopped long and hard and watched several YouTube videos before buying this one. He didn&#x27;t want the &#x27;stubble&#x27; look, he wanted a beard trimmer and something to keep the edges of his beard sharp. Most of the beard trimmers I found weren&#x27;t deep enough to maintain a beard. They were for the stubble look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son called me the day after Christmas to proudly tell me he was all trimmed up and really liked it. It served all of his purposes to maintain his goatee. Mom and son are both happy!</li>
            <li> Its an OK razor for trimming and what not but when I need a close shave I end up just using a disposable because the razor on this sucks for a close shave. Its great for razor burn tho!</li>
            <li> I did a search and the lowest price I could find was at Amazon for the following item.&lt;br /&gt;The Braun Cruzer 6 gives an excellent shave and the hair trimmer works well but I cannot find any information on the battery life or how it can be replaced or even if it can be replaced. This is no reflection on Amazon but on the Braun company.</li>
            <li> After seeing really decent reviews I was convinced to buy this shaver. Once I had it in my hands I was impressed with the design and features. The big problem is that it&#x27;s not very powerful and does not do a good job of shaving. It misses many hairs on my neck and leaves them long. The detail trimmer also has trouble cutting my beard for shaping. Overall I&#x27;m upset that this shaver did not live up to it&#x27;s potential. Do not buy if you have a MANLY BEARD to tough for weak shavers.</li>
            <li> I got this to keep my &amp;#34;winter&amp;#34; beard trimmed.  I have a fairly thick beard when I grow it and this shaver has had no trouble dealing with it.  There could be some more beard length options, but really what is has is adequate.  The best feature is its ability to be used in the shower.  Now no more cleaning up all the little hairs around the sink, you just rinse them down the shower drain!  I have a Series 7 Braun for regular shaving and the foil shaver on this feels like a toy compared to it, but it does work in a pinch.</li>
            <li> I manage to shave with a 3 blade disposable razor in less than 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;With this item, the shaving takes longer and it doesn&#x27;t even shave properly.&lt;br /&gt;So it might have fancy options likes eyesbrows cutting and all but if it cannot shave properly, then it&#x27;s just a grooming tool, not a shaver...</li>
            <li> It does not seem to easily trim the hair with length that i want. although shaver is good.&lt;br /&gt;I will rate it as 3.5 stars overall</li>
            <li> it is one of the greatest shaving machine i have ever use it is really fabulous specially once i have tried it under the water .it works effectively</li>
            <li> Guard broke on me after less than 3 years. Granted I didn&#x27;t use it on my face every time—I will NOT have my pits look like a prickly, irritated wasteland or Cthulhu&#x27;s mustache after a run-in an overheated flat iron— but it should be more solidly built than this. Snapped in half where the button, guard, and cover meet, held together with the smallest dabs of plastic. The adjustment button, free spirit that it is, then flew right down the drain after being sandwiched between the two other parts instead of more firmly connected to either. And now I find myself with an adjustable trimmer that doesn&#x27;t adjust and an electric shaver that&#x27;s barely qualified to touch any of our lovely faces.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about the Braun Cruzer.  Really, how much better can it be than other shavers?  Well, it&#x27;s a really good shaver.  Quiet, powerful, and very comfortable.  I have used electric shavers for years for convenience when traveling.  The Braun Cruzer is the most comfortable shaver I&#x27;ve used so far.  The number of accessories are a bit daunting and it took me a few tries with the trimmer attachments to figure out what settings are best for me, but overall, an excellent product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for trimming sideburns, neatening up beards or 5 o&#x27;clock shadows, etc., but it&#x27;s an absolute nightmare to use for an actual shave. It leaves my face super-patchy and absolutely raw after marathon shave sessions that just leave me using a disposable razor.</li>
            <li> Excellen[[ASIN:B004WIUNCQ Braun Cruzer 6 Face Cruzer, 6 Face Shaver]][[ASIN:B004WIUNCQ Braun Cruzer 6 Face Cruzer, 6 Face Shaver]]t in  every weay![[ASIN:B0020MMCB6 Braun Series 3 370 Men&#x27;s Shaver]][[ASIN:B004WIUNCQ Braun Cruzer 6 Face Cruzer, 6 Face Shaver]]</li>
            <li> I have used the beard trimmer and detail shaver several times now and it works well.  For a close save around the edges, I still, periodically, shave with a regular razor.  No electric will get as close as the blade, but this does a good job in between.</li>
            <li> Just as described. Good product.</li>
            <li> I bought it with high expectations, and the $70-ish price reinforced those expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, for a product with such versatility, there are no usable instructions. Same thing online, on Braun&#x27;s website. Instructions are the same for different models, and don&#x27;t really explain what each piece should be used for.&lt;br /&gt;I almost never read instructions for anything, but if I am going to cut my beard or shave I want to do it right. And I am playing with blades right next to my throat right?&lt;br /&gt;Until now I haven&#x27;t figured out if this TERRIBLE for shaving or if I&#x27;m doing something wrong (and, yes, it should be difficult to go wrong with just shaving). So I end up trimming part of my beard (which is what I bought it for), and using normal shaving blades to shave the other part. Besides, even the trimmed beard is not uniformly cut, and I wish I could trim it a bit shorter. (Again, is it possible to cut it shorter somehow, or is it just plainly impossible? No clue)</li>
            <li> I based my purchase decision of his based on some reviews that I saw. Well sad to say after trying it repeatedly, it doesn&#x27;t come close to the shave quality that was emphasized. It will cut thick hair, but for a clean controlled cut, you can do better.</li>
            <li> Okay I read the reviews, nearly all of them, starting with the negative then moving to the positive. I was not impressed by the reviews but Brauns money back guarantee gave me the courage to buy the product and try it out, so I did. I bought the Cruzer Face 6 and the series 790 here on Amazon. These are my thoughts on the Cruzer Face 6 so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is a masterpiece. I suffer from sensitive skin and I always loved having a sharp square goatee. My face is super sensitive to razors. If I shave my face twice a week with the Gillette Sensor Excell razor, I will get dark colored, irritated skin and break out in nasty bumps. I have been suffering this razor rash type of reaction since I was 14, so I&#x27;ve been forced to shave my face only once a week and go scruffy the rest of the week until I knew I could shave again without messin&#x27; myself up. I bought the Andis T outliner, and it worked great for a trim, but it was never accurate enough to give me the sharpness I was looking for around my chin, and using that thing to shave my neck area was a nightmare. It pinched my skin and would cut me from time to time, also too much Andis was no better than using a razor because it irritated my skin in the neck area from frequent usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally I thought I would try and figure this out after 20 years of shaving. I had enough of the torture and abuse and I decided to find something that worked no matter how much it cost me. I&#x27;m so happy I bought the Cruzer Face 6. The first time I used it, the larger trimmer was accurate enough and the smaller trimmer on the flipside was put the dots on the I and crosses the T. I was very impressed by the trimming. The shaver however, did not do as good a job as a razor edge, but it did get 95% of all the hairs, and I used a razor to nick the rest. Because my hair is shaved in the neck now, I believe daily usage will do a better job at getting all of them. I&#x27;m not overly impressed with the shaver, but the trimmer is the bestI&#x27;ve used for my face so that alone makes this product worth it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part about the Cruzer is that it did not irritate my skin, and I made several passes because the shaver needed time to get all the longer hairs. It was super delicate to my skin and its a shaver that I can use daily now. Because my hair is short, I think it will work much better so I can stay scruffless. I am guilt free when I shave my neck now, and having a square goatee that is clean and sharp everyday is dreamy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the bad reviews on the shaver, I bought the series 790 at the same time, but it&#x27;s not here yet, so I haven&#x27;t had the chance to try it out. This cruzer does a decent enough job shaving that I think I may send the 790 back, but I don&#x27;t know, we will see when I test it. I will update this review soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 1/4/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, I have had time to use my new Series 7, 790 braun shaver that just came in. I have to admit, under my chin, the series 7 does a good job of getting I&#x27;d say about 98% of all my hairs. I attribute its better performance under my chin to the center cutter that is positioned between the two foil cutters. So if you need your whole face shaven every day, the series 7 does better at shaving under the neck. As far as the cheeks, chin, and mouth area, for me they perform the same. The cruzer face 6 however does a far better job of maintaining a goatee. If I had to choose to keep only one, I would choose the cruzer face 6 for its versatility. The cruzer is also smaller and therefor is better for targeting specific areas, such as if you want a square mustache and you need to trim a line just underneath the nose with the shave, this is possible with the cruser because of its narrow rectangular foil. The series 7 is more box like in shape. Square, so trimming a mustache shape under the nose is not possible.</li>
            <li> It is acceptable for quick shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I faced two problemes with this shavr&lt;br /&gt;1- the battery dose not last for long time as mentioned 30 min.&lt;br /&gt;2- it dose not shave all the haire so I use my other Braun shaver for totally clean shave.</li>
            <li> It works fine, the shaver could be better, but it is what you should expect for this price. Seems better than other similar products.</li>
            <li> Mid size shaver, it charges fast and easy.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t like than you don&#x27;t get a clean shave, but for all than like looks a 3 day beard, is ok</li>
            <li> It is very good for what it does.&lt;br /&gt;Important: battery really lasts and charges fast.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it, especially for the price tag it has.</li>
            <li> It is not that fantastic</li>
            <li> I bought this razor a while ago and I decided to make a comment. For the price and performance seemed to read me a great machine. My problem came when innocent me thought that it is so fashionable now that we&#x27;re both men, the beard of three days two slightly trimmed, which allows us to not shave daily but not go scruffy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this machine is not for that, is to shave completely and not leave even one hair on the face, or to adecuarte or recortarte a dense beard, no stubble rather serves only to a beard of weeks .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is a joy to use both, but if you want something other than those two options is not your machine</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an aging version of the same model. I like this shaver because it has a trimmer that I find essential. When I don&#x27;t shave for two or more days, the whiskers are too tough for the shaving head to handle without discomfort. On those occasions I attack the whiskers first with the trimmer, then go over everything again with the shaving head. In essence, i shave twice. If I shave every day, I only need to use the shaving head. I&#x27;d be lost without the trimmer (or have to buy a separate one). I have no use for the beard attachment that comes with the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use the trimmer to trim the fuzz on the back of my neck---tricky to do with two mirrors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a rechargable shaver: plug it in to recharge it, then unplug it and shave several times before recharging again. Unlike the previous model I had, this one does not allow you to shave while recharging. But it takes a short time (ten minutes?) to charge enough for one shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made, doesn&#x27;t give close shave, and makes a mess unlike the vacuum kind. I would purchase a different one. However, if a decent one is all you&#x27;re looking for, then go for it rather than a $10-20 one.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd one that I&#x27;ve had over the last 10 + years. The only problem I ever had was that the beard trimmer blades stopped working, but when they did, the Cruzer was a fully functional shaver and beard trimmer as long as you provided proper maintenance by oiling the cutting block every so often, and of course cleaning the device after every 2nd or 3rd use as a shaver and after every use as a beard trimmer. This model is a bit sleeker and there are no problems with its ability to function purely as a shaver. It&#x27;s a handy little device and great for traveling....</li>
            <li> not good cuz the perfomance is low not take clearly</li>
            <li> Very good price for what it can do. Really amazing machine. I also have the 5 series witch is also very good. I recommend it with no doubts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for shaving everyday. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend letting your beard grow, then shaving. Waterproof is a huge plus, really easy to clean.  Overall good buy.</li>
            <li> this shaver works great for years, I broke trimmer part and can not find replacement part so use rubber band to hold it on while trimming beard.</li>
            <li> I had this a few months and love it.  It&#x27;s great for trimming your beard, and the foil shaver gives you a nice close shave on the parts you want smooth.  The only problem is the blue guard that attaches to the unit.  The notches on the guard that allow you to select the beard length wear out very easily and now mine won&#x27;t stay on any setting other than the shortest.  Every time I try to put it on notch 2 or 3, it slips back down to notch 1 and give me a closer trip than I want.  It must be a defect in the design since I&#x27;ve been very gentle with my unit.</li>
            <li> not nearly as good as a braun shaver, but for half the price or less I shouldn&#x27;t be too upset</li>
            <li> I really love this shaver, it meets all my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really easy to use and very precise.&lt;br /&gt;The combs included are great, it&#x27;s easy to regulate the length of beard you want to have with the combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To have the best shave, it&#x27;s better to trim first so then the hair has a minimal length, and then you use the shaver part.&lt;br /&gt;That gets me the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would tottaly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Braun Cruzer is indeed a well made product. Ive been using shavers for four years and most have had problems after a couple months of use despite my attempt to maintain them. I have yet to run into any problems.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works great. The shaver however needs improvement. Its very difficult to achieve a close shave. I am doomed to continue to uses a razor. The Beard and mustache trimmer are Great.</li>
            <li> This is handy if you just want to take one tool for travel trimming, but it is pretty flimsy and doesn&#x27;t stand up to daily use.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver as a gift for my son and he really liked it.  It had attachments to trim his beard which he found extremely effective &amp; user friendly!</li>
            <li> Love this razor, I&#x27;ve had the cruiser 3 before. That&#x27;s why ordered another.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 years ago. Still works fine.</li>
            <li> Versatile shaver. Works well. Easy to maintain.&lt;br /&gt;Only wish that it had a couple more &#x27;length options&#x27; for trimming my beard.</li>
            <li> This is the third braun  shaver I bought ... all of which became partially useless in few months of light use. The plastic on the thingi that control the length is so bad . All my braun shavers length pieces broke. does not worth the money .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;look into other brands .... I switched to different brand and I am very happy with the change i made.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot is easy and I going to get another one for my son, because he keeps taking mine.</li>
            <li> Very unique idea of combining so many shaving features. But one of the shaving guides got loose, and when I tried to get a replacement, it is impossible to contact the company.</li>
            <li> First, my qualifications: I&#x27;m a man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, my opinion: The Braun Cruzer is worth the investment and is a good shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like:&lt;br /&gt;  - The trimmer cuts through days/weeks old growth with no trouble, and doesn&#x27;t nick or cut my face&lt;br /&gt;  - The close shave portion (grill area) is great for the chin, upper lip, and cheek areas and gives a nice, close shave&lt;br /&gt;  - The battery life is pretty good... I&#x27;ve gone long stretches without having to recharge it (weeks)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t care for:&lt;br /&gt;  - The plastic attachments for beards, side burns, etc. seemed too finicky for me and not worth the trouble.  When I used them the whole process (and result) was clumsy and subpar.&lt;br /&gt;  - The grill area does poorly in the neck area, especially with hair that is 2 days or more in length. It takes a long time to go over the neck area in four different directions, and then there is still lots of hair that is missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use this for daily maintenance and basic shaving then I can attest that it will do a great overall job.</li>
            <li> Not perfect but really good. Just missing more levels for the trim. Easy clean with water proof. Better than Philips.</li>
            <li> Economical price, found as described and fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple, fabulous and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommended, will deal again in future for sure.</li>
            <li> As all Braun machines, this worked fine for me</li>
            <li> Works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and is very gentle on skin. Fast trim, precision cut, and a clean stubble look. Get it with this amazing product. Very satisfied and the seller shipped the product instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a terrible shaver! I had to go over the same spot more than 5 times to get it completely shaved! don&#x27;t waste your money on this product. I use to have the Cruzer 3 it was much better than this junk. for now I stick to my Panasonic ES8103 it&#x27;s much better than this...</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a close shave than this is not for you. the flip trimmer was what i was looking for and it does the job. the smaller trimmer was an unexpected surprise as well. i have a beard so this does well for trimming and getting a closer shave on my neck.</li>
            <li> I have took this product mainly for shaving ,after using I felt its spoiling my skin.&lt;br /&gt;planning to return the product</li>
            <li> Thru the years, I have used many shavers and beard trimmers. It&#x27;s nice to have both in one unit. Thus far I have only used it a couple of times, but am impressed so far. The 3-day stubble attachment is too low for my preference. Therefore I have used the adjustable beard trimmer with great satisfaction. The shaver is excellent for my neck area where I prefer to remain clean shaven and define my beard. The con: I wish that it had a protective cover for the shaver as well as a carry bag.</li>
            <li> Its nice and does its job well. But before you order, be very clear about why you are ordering it. Braun has three different products. But two of them, i.e., shave and trimmer have some overlapping features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep a stubble and shave using my Gillette razor. Even after going through Braun&#x27;s site, I was not able to figure out whether main blade will do trimming with attachments or will rear trimmer act as only trimmer.  I felt that attachments will convert main blade into a trimmer and if you remove attachments, it will become a shaver. However, only smaller blades on top of the product act as trimmers while attachments completely cover its shaver part. Effectively, shaver part will be rarely used by me. So, I am wondering whether only trimmer would have been good enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong, trimmer is excellent and I do not mind the option of having an electric shaver. But now my battery life gets wasted on the shaver blades (although covered, they also keep working when trimmer is on). I would have been happier ordering Braun&#x27;s head and beard trimmer instead since it allows more length settings and has much much more battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if I made a mistake in understanding usage or was the description not clear enough on the site. But thought of sharing with the next &#x27;stubble&#x27; person who looks at this one! :)</li>
            <li> It charges quickly and looks nice, but it has lots of attachments. I thought it was all on one. Not change this or move this or flip this. Now put on this guard. Hopefully he will soon get use to it and it wont be wasted money</li>
            <li> Good product with many thoughtful features. I like how the extendable portion acts a a cover for the foil when attached. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> I have looked long and hard for a razer with these functions (and it was not easy to find) if you want a rechargable foil shaver with all the necessary functions, small size and small price, this is it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product with many functions and acessories. The design is beautiful. At the beginning it&#x27;s a bit difficult to shave, but with time you will get used to it and then you will achieve a perfect result.&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is a bit short, because everytime you shave you have to charge it or sometimes at the middle of the shaving process it stops and then you have to wait until it is charged.&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of other Braun products that I owned had worked really well.  This product was a complete disappointment, my beard is coarse and this shaver was completely useless.  Spend your money on something else.</li>
            <li> I guess this is pretty good and i did not get it for the electric shaver so i didnt care to find out it was almost useless. I like the product nonetheless. There are probably better out there though.</li>
            <li> The amount of flexibility this shaver has is nice for shaping a beard, cutting close around the edges, and getting extra close where it&#x27;s needed. However, it does all of the previously mentioned tasks sub-par. I always end up with missed long hairs, patchy spots, and then split ends of hair (like having fishing hooks stuck in my face). All of this happens even while being extra careful, cutting really close, taking my time, etc. I&#x27;m not sure who they tested this on but they must have had the mane of a unicorn because this isn&#x27;t good at cutting facial hair at all.</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver , it has a nice design and it&#x27;s pretty light-weight. It has almost everything you need to any style from a clean shave to a stubble or goatee. The only problem I found , although they say in the manual  it is for safety reasons ,  Is that you cannot use it while charging. But overall it would be worth it if it lasts.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace my Braun Cruzer 2 which I&#x27;ve  had for years but the trimmer stopped working.  After reading some of the negative reviews I was a little hesitant to purchase the newer Cruzer, but I&#x27;ve been very happy with it!  It shaves close without irritation and ttrimmer works very well with my beard.  I get about a week and a half to two weeks shaving on a single charge.  My only complaint is the new Cruzer will not run when plugged in, the Cruzer 2 would.  That means I have to wait five minutes for the Cruzer to charge before finishing my shave if it quits in the middle of a shave. I could prevent this by just charging the shaver once a week (only takes about 15 min for a full charge).</li>
            <li> Bought this product after reading some good reviews. After using it I&#x27;m sure that it might be great for styling but from the first time i used it it wasn&#x27;t any good for a close shave. You continually have to go over the same area multiple times from different directions and with all the other electric shavers I&#x27;ve had I&#x27;ve only usually needed to go twice against the grain to get a great shave. Not sure if its the grilles design or the clearance between this and the cutting blade.</li>
            <li> Does not do the job. The trimmer is not good at all. Not happy with the product. Please live up to Braun&#x27;s name.</li>
            <li> favorite electric razor</li>
            <li> This shaver is ok with trimming your beard, but it is poor at face shaving.</li>
            <li> this should be the end of the cruzers series , Avoid avoid avoid , for $30 u can get a better shaver and save yourself some bucks. a very poor shaving machine that u will need to clean ur face with a razor after using it, push it as much as u can to ur face and it will still leave those greeny hair all over ur face , my advice Dont buy it</li>
            <li> This product does a lot of things really well, but does not do any one thing great.  It only offers 4 guard levels for beard trimming.  This is OK with me because I use just one level on my whole beard and I like it.  I use the second shortest guard level.  I might like to use a level that is between 2 and 3 but it doesn&#x27;t exist.  I keep my neck clean shaven and here is where this product is only slightly above average.  Of course nothing works better than a razor for a clean shave.  With this product I can get it really close, but it just takes a lot of passes.  It can be a little tricky when shaving near the beard line because you have to be careful making multiple passes so close to your beard or else you might accidentally take a divot out of your beard.  On a positive note it is great to travel with.  It holds a charge very well.  On short business trips I don&#x27;t even pack the charger.  Overall I like this product.</li>
            <li> Meh.  It&#x27;s ok.  Not very strong for shaving down to the skin.  I sometimes try it but then get tire/bored and wind up shaving with a razor and cream.  Works best for the hair right under my nose, which is sometimes hard to reach with a razor.  But you don&#x27;t need an expensive electric shave for that.  Beard trimming is mediocre at best.  I&#x27;d prefer a clipper style beard trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this or buy it again.</li>
            <li> Very nice results when used as trimmer, using it for shaving not much you can only get nice results when used after regular blates</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a decent shaver that wouldn&#x27;t empty my wallet.  So far, this works wonderful. The various guards make beard trimming easy and the twistable trimmer is great. it&#x27;s also able to be used in the shower. I would buy this shaver again and recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> This product was made for young guys (in their 20&#x27;s) with light beards. End of story. Fortunately I fit that category and enjoy this product very much. I primarily use it to maintain a stubble length so I look a little older, which is important for my job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use the foil blade, which again, works great for guys with light beards. It makes my skin smooth as if I shaved with a razor in almost all spots on my face. I have very sensitive skin, and regularly draw blood with a razor because of it. This product has only nicked me once, which I think says a lot about the quality of the foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the beard grooming attachments, but they appear \\&quot;cool and trendy\\&quot;. If I was able to grow enough of a beard to use these attachments, I doubt the trimmer would meet my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a great product for the price as long as you grow a light beard. It&#x27;s waterproof, it&#x27;s easy to clean, it sits in a recharging base, the foil can be replaced (though I don&#x27;t know about the trimmer head), and most importantly is comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> We are returning this razor for a better model.  We never took it out of the box after he made his wishes more clear.</li>
            <li> I do not use this machine as much as a lot of people because i cannot grow a full beard yet, but it is incredibly good to clean my face and keep all my facial hair at one level so it wont look messy.</li>
            <li> I AM BIG FAN OF BRAUN. I HAVE BEEN USING BRAUN SHAVER  FOR TWENTY FIVE, THIRTY YEARS. I HOPE TO BE USING IT LONGER. IF YOU HAVE A BIGGER LINE, COULD YOU PUT IT ON SHOW. THANK YOU</li>
