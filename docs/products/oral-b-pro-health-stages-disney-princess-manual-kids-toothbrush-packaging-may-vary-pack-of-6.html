            <li>The pictures on the toothbrush was so lovely</li>
            <li>After my child uses it, she starts to love brushing</li>
            <li>Mostly because it comes in 6 pack and its oral b quality.</li>
            <li>Love this bulk package of princess toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>My girls 2 1/2 and 5 love these tooth brushes.</li>
            <li>They seem to hold up better.</li>
            <li>Kids love it.</li>
            <li>whats not to love about the quality of oral B.  </li>
            <li>My favorite tooth brush</li>
            <li>I use it for more than 2 minutes though - more like 3-4.</li>
            <li>My kids love the princesses and these toothbrushes fit in their hands</li>
            <li>My daughter can easily hold these and maneuver them around her mouth with no problem.  </li>
            <li>and my brother&#x27;s daughter liked it very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was soft and good for kids.</li>
            <li>These brushes make my teeth squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>I use a rubber tipped gum tool (Gum Butler) to clean around my gums</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t even able to get a full cleaning done in that first appointment because there was so much inflammation and plaque build-up.</li>
            <li>Love these toothbrushes for my 28 month old.  </li>
            <li>just right.  </li>
            <li>She liked them ok but really wish they would tell you exactly what you are getting or have other pictures...</li>
            <li>When I first started brushing her teeth</li>
            <li>After doing this every morning, and regular flossing and brushing every night I am finally free of the gingivitis!</li>
            <li>They are much better than the ones you get at the dollar store, yet cheap enough that we can toss them after the multiple colds, etc.</li>
            <li>then I take a Johnson &amp; Johnson Red Cross Gauze Pad which I unfold and use to clean around my gum line inside and out, top and bottom.</li>
            <li>It really helps to serve as a reminder for changing out the kids&#x27; toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>my daughter is very into princess.</li>
            <li>First she recommended a new toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Plus you can scan these in the Disney brushing app for smart phones and get a cute video for your little one to brush with.</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended cleaning every 3 months, which I never missed until about this time last spring when after moving to a new state I got caught in the US Heath care law change and wasn&#x27;t able to get back into a plan for almost 8 months.</li>
            <li>bristles stay strong for a long time and yet are soft for young gums.  </li>
            <li>right away - it has the same ingredient that is used in antibacterial hand cleaner!</li>
            <li>I like this toothbrush far more than any adult small toothbrush that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>so they fit well into little mouths and between the cheek and teeth.</li>
            <li>I use subscribe and save to get these sent frequently.</li>
            <li>She had been using them since she was about 24 months old</li>
            <li>So far I have bought 12 of these and will probably keep doing so til she grows out of them.</li>
            <li>She recommended a natural toothpaste instead</li>
            <li>In that appointment the hygienist gave me several new methods to use in caring for my teeth.</li>
            <li>The heads are compact and the bristles short but very soft</li>
            <li>My 3 year old daughter loves these and the multiple toothbrush pack is a bonus.  </li>
            <li>So when I first went to the dentist in my new town they told me that my mouth was a real mess.</li>
            <li>So thanks for staying with me on this long review, but I wanted to share the information that has helped to make such a big difference for me.</li>
            <li>Finally, some of the things to love about this toothbrush are the small head - the shape is short and wide - so it is easier to really get around each tooth and up around the gum line and unlike any other toothbrush I have ever used, I can actually get all the way round my back molars.</li>

            <li> Great Product but I have a daughter obsessed with Snow White so when I saw the picture I knew they would be perfect. I thought at least one of the 6 would have her on it. All we received was Ariel, Belle and one Tiana :( She liked them ok but really wish they would tell you exactly what you are getting or have other pictures...</li>
            <li> For children under the age of 5 to 7, the toothbrush head is a bit big</li>
            <li> I use subscribe and save to get these sent frequently. It really helps to serve as a reminder for changing out the kids&#x27; toothbrushes. We do it monthly since at this age, they are pretty rough with their brushes and sometimes bite down on the bristles.</li>

            <li> Really a good toothbrush, my girl loves it and she share them to her classmate.</li>
            <li> Love these toothbrushes for my 28 month old.  She had been using them since she was about 24 months old and I think they are the best for that age even though they say 5-7 years.  When I first started brushing her teeth I used the recommended toothbrushes for her age but my girl likes to chew the bristles so she just destroyed those.  These are a little bit hardier so I can go longer before having to swap it out.  Plus she loves the princesses on the handle.  My daughter can easily hold these and maneuver them around her mouth with no problem.  So far I have bought 12 of these and will probably keep doing so til she grows out of them.</li>
            <li> Great.  Kids love it!</li>
            <li> My kids love the princesses, It was just what we wanted, our Girls loved it,</li>
            <li> my daughter is very into princess. This brush does the trick. By ordering through &amp;#34;subsrbie and save&amp;#34;, and price is very good.</li>
            <li> Mostly because it comes in 6 pack and its oral b quality. A must have with the little princess in your life.</li>
            <li> We have toothbrushes on order every quarter. This means we have plenty when they are &amp;#34;lost&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;misplaced.&amp;#34; Also, I do not think about purchasing on a monthly basis. This may not be the least expensive option, this is the keep my life simple option.</li>
            <li> Love this bulk package of princess toothbrushes. Just wish there would have been one of each princess instead of 4 of the same and 2 of another. Otherwise, good deal.</li>
            <li> My girls 2 1/2 and 5 love these tooth brushes. They are much better than the ones you get at the dollar store, yet cheap enough that we can toss them after the multiple colds, etc. that they get in the winter season!</li>
            <li> My kids love the princesses and these toothbrushes fit in their hands just right.  I prefer oral b toothbrushes over the other brands.  They seem to hold up better.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush.  Kids love it.</li>
            <li> whats not to love about the quality of oral B.  My favorite tooth brush</li>
            <li> These Oral B Stages toothbrushes are the best for children.  The heads are compact and the bristles short but very soft so they fit well into little mouths and between the cheek and teeth. My 8yo daughter still uses these even though past the age &#x27;recommended&#x27; for as she has a little mouth.  We also start using them for younger than the age 5 as they are smaller than all of the other &#x27;toddler&#x27; and small toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles stay strong for a long time and yet are soft for young gums.  We brush 2-3 times a day and replace our brushes about every 6 months when the bristles begin to bend on the edges.&lt;br /&gt;Buying them in large packs like this makes a great deal for our 3 girls plus having some extras on hand for guests who forget theirs.</li>
            <li> This Toothbrush was a game changer for me. I am a middle aged woman with a small frame, and hence, a small mouth. Although I have used a Sonicare toothbrush for the past 20 or so years, I have spent the past 5 years battling with gingivitis. My dentist recommended cleaning every 3 months, which I never missed until about this time last spring when after moving to a new state I got caught in the US Heath care law change and wasn&#x27;t able to get back into a plan for almost 8 months. So when I first went to the dentist in my new town they told me that my mouth was a real mess. I wasn&#x27;t even able to get a full cleaning done in that first appointment because there was so much inflammation and plaque build-up. I went back again several weeks later to finish the job. In that appointment the hygienist gave me several new methods to use in caring for my teeth. First she recommended a new toothpaste. I had been using Arm &amp; Hammer Peroxicare with Baking Soda until it starting giving me blisters on my tounge and I switched to Colgate Total Toothpaste. The Hygienist told me to STOP using that right away - it has the same ingredient that is used in antibacterial hand cleaner! She recommended a natural toothpaste instead and I choose Trader Joe&#x27;s Antiplaque Toothpaste with Fennel, Propolis &amp; Myrrh. The bleeding in my gums which happened EVERY time I brushed my teeth stopped the very next day! At the same time I also switched from my Sonicare tooth brush (which just happened to die at about the same time) to a children&#x27;s toothbrush upon her recommendation. I chose this one, which I love! I use it for more than 2 minutes though - more like 3-4. At the same time I added two small steps to my tooth brushing regime: In the morning after brushing (but not flossing) I use a rubber tipped gum tool (Gum Butler) to clean around my gums then I take a Johnson &amp; Johnson Red Cross Gauze Pad which I unfold and use to clean around my gum line inside and out, top and bottom. After doing this every morning, and regular flossing and brushing every night I am finally free of the gingivitis! After only 3 months of using this toothbrush and adding a few steps! I had honestly expected that I would have gum disease for the rest of my life. So thanks for staying with me on this long review, but I wanted to share the information that has helped to make such a big difference for me. Finally, some of the things to love about this toothbrush are the small head - the shape is short and wide - so it is easier to really get around each tooth and up around the gum line and unlike any other toothbrush I have ever used, I can actually get all the way round my back molars. I like this toothbrush far more than any adult small toothbrush that I have ever used.</li>
