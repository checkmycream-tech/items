            <li>Now i cut my own hair.</li>
            <li>Also does a handy job on manscaping, just sayin.</li>
            <li>If you cut your own hair, or someone else, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li>i can do my own in minutes just like the pros.</li>
            <li>but I insisted they get their own.</li>
            <li>High quality build with a sturdy feel and excellent handling.</li>
            <li>VERY easy</li>
            <li>Has a very strong sounding motor in it.</li>
            <li>Every tithing was very good Fast shipping</li>
            <li>This is by far the BEST Wahl clipper I have owned!</li>
            <li>/&gt;this product works great and at a very reasonable price, recommended.</li>
            <li>and i did a great job on my first try.</li>
            <li>It cuts very smoothly.</li>
            <li>The build is great, I own three separate clippers - and this is my new fav.</li>
            <li>I love the trimmer itself.  </li>
            <li>I expect many years of service.</li>
            <li>The kit comes with plenty of guards to accommodate most hair lengths.</li>
            <li>Now there is damage to my counter top.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, I love the chrome finishing on these clippers.</li>
            <li>For all the people, who are struggling financially, this is the best buy you can get.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great price and quality product.</li>
            <li>Outstanding product.</li>
            <li>I used it for shaving everything, and I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better than this.</li>
            <li>Love these clippers.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t imagine how much of a better product these could be.</li>
            <li>Perfect cut!&lt;br /&gt;No need to spend several times in the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Worth it !!</li>
            <li>Ok so 3 stars because it works...</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>and it works PERFECT, clean cut, he can adjust to the size he needs and it fits all his old Wahl clip ons.</li>
            <li>Cuts very clean every time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is perfect balance even when you cut for long periods of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pretty good buy.</li>
            <li>With this set I can easily do it weekly.  </li>
            <li>If you like a nice tight fade, the 0.5, 1, and 1.5 guards allow for a beautiful cut every time.  </li>
            <li>I was brave buying the same brand</li>
            <li>started making that vibrating noise and sound that some have described here after about two months of using, but then it stopped.</li>
            <li>Great for a simple hair cut.</li>
            <li>nice hair trimmer, i had an old one before which used to pull hair when i cut my kids hair, this one cuts all the hair in one shot, kids love it too now</li>
            <li>Bought as a replacement for an old Wahl - very satisfied with this one.</li>
            <li>You can shave a head in about three minutes with these clippers, thats how strong and powerful these things are.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know too much about hair-cutters, but one thing I do know is that I love this hair-cutter.  </li>
            <li>Smooth work yet powerful in operation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love them that much.</li>
            <li>Ergonomic,  smooth-like run, intuitive, and includes the full package.</li>
            <li>The powerful motor made the process quick and precise.</li>
            <li>I bought this one thinking it would be better than its older models but they added a protectice bar under the claws so it makes it so you can&#x27;t get as close od a trim as I prefer.</li>
            <li>I was totally excited about buying this for my hubby for christmas as he always complains about his other not working as good.</li>
            <li>For a $25 hair cutting kit, I&#x27;m more than impressed with the guard options.  </li>
            <li>Wahl Five Star Magic Professional Hair Clipper on the other hand has been really really good.</li>
            <li>and I was very pleased with the great results from this hair cutting kit.</li>
            <li>the record, my husband had normal, fine hair.</li>
            <li>Solid clipper with a very strong motor.  </li>
            <li>No other clippers come with such nice guards for the price!</li>
            <li>Thanks very much!</li>
            <li>I was tempted to keep the sturdy, round-tipped combs from my old Vidal Sassoon trimmer, but they don&#x27;t quite fit.  </li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve ever had one.</li>
            <li>I also use it for the beard, for wich it&#x27;s size doesn&#x27;t help much, but it&#x27;s still useful and works as well.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>and I were pretty disapointed.</li>
            <li>All of them are made of soft, cheap plastic material.  </li>
            <li>but it is good to have a few that are suited for my needs.</li>
            <li>I have THICK hair, every accessory you could need I can cut my own hair with these rather easily</li>
            <li>I thought about purchasing a new set of blades, but when I saw I could purchase a whole new trimmer and combs for under $30, it makes more sense to invest in the new one.  </li>
            <li>Quiet, well made, easy, ............</li>
            <li>and it always gets the hair in the first run through, and is very quiet and smooth.</li>
            <li>Professional Super Taper II Hair Clipper 8470</li>
            <li>It certainly gives them a polished and durable</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more powerful than his previous trimmer</li>
            <li>Works great, i had no experience cutting my hair and this made the job easy,</li>
            <li>I feel these are studio quality and cut very even.</li>
            <li>I really recommend it.</li>
            <li>Durable and very convenient to have @ home.</li>
            <li>Very sleek</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>In five minutes I was ready to go.</li>
            <li>The whole thing is going into the garbage can.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re nice and smooth cutting and very quiet and my package got to me very quickly.</li>
            <li>I had an older model of his one before it, but it died on me.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it for beginners.</li>
            <li>I simply love these clippers and I have to get new ones for any reason I&#x27;ll simply get the same ones.</li>
            <li>Be sure to put some of the oil on the clippers every once in a while or your hair will get caught and may be pulled a little.</li>
            <li>As far as the criticism I see, I don&#x27;t really get it.</li>
            <li>I would recomend this product to professional barbers only, because if you are just starting these clippers are advance and you can easily make a mistake with these.</li>
            <li>old clippers used to get really warm and noisy after about 15 minutes of use ( I used to take that long then because I was new to cutting my own hair)</li>
            <li>They are fine for once a month, but not heavy duty enough for daily professional use.</li>
            <li>Rather light weight product compared to two previous Wahl clippers I have purchased.  </li>
            <li>Looks like a professional cut costing $15-$25.  </li>
            <li>I also miss my old box, that had a place for every item.  </li>
            <li>These clippers are not made for thicker, coarse, or very curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Complete set</li>
            <li>My boyfriend cuts his hair himself and had used his old Wahl clippers for over 10 year, I got him this set</li>
            <li>I could see as soon as the director called action</li>
            <li>They are not too loud.</li>
            <li>Wahl is the best hair cutting brand if you ask me and this product doesn&#x27;t let me down.  </li>
            <li>The motor is quiet, and it feels high quality.  </li>
            <li>When I was cutting my hair it gave me a smooth clean cut.</li>
            <li>Save gas, tips, and general fee for get a cut from a barber, which is a luxury.</li>
            <li>Have used it only 2-3 times so far.</li>
            <li>I cut everyone&#x27;s hair in my house including my Old English SheepDog.</li>
            <li>They work fine for regular, not too thick, straighter hair.  </li>
            <li>Still longer hairs sticking up, had to go over the same spots more then 3 or 4 times,  and the darn thing must have jammed up at least 3 times while using.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The blades came with just the right sharpness not sharp enough to nick you and not too dull to cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No excuse as to why this didn&#x27;t cut properly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no haircutter wich means that I use it in average thrice a month; even tough, I find it very easy to use.</li>
            <li>+ haircuts without much maintenance at all besides a little bit of clipper oil once a month or so.  </li>

            <li> I bought this one thinking it would be better than its older models but they added a protectice bar under the claws so it makes it so you can&#x27;t get as close od a trim as I prefer.</li>
            <li> I was totally excited about buying this for my hubby for christmas as he always complains about his other not working as good.</li>
            <li> For a $25 hair cutting kit, I&#x27;m more than impressed with the guard options.  </li>
            <li> Wahl Five Star Magic Professional Hair Clipper on the other hand has been really really good.</li>
            <li> and I was very pleased with the great results from this hair cutting kit.</li>
            <li> the record, my husband had normal, fine hair.</li>
            <li> Solid clipper with a very strong motor.  </li>
            <li> No other clippers come with such nice guards for the price!</li>
            <li> Thanks very much!</li>
            <li> I was tempted to keep the sturdy, round-tipped combs from my old Vidal Sassoon trimmer, but they don&#x27;t quite fit.  </li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve ever had one.</li>
            <li> I also use it for the beard, for wich it&#x27;s size doesn&#x27;t help much, but it&#x27;s still useful and works as well.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> and I were pretty disapointed.</li>
            <li> All of them are made of soft, cheap plastic material.  </li>
            <li> but it is good to have a few that are suited for my needs.</li>
            <li> I have THICK hair, every accessory you could need I can cut my own hair with these rather easily</li>
            <li> I thought about purchasing a new set of blades, but when I saw I could purchase a whole new trimmer and combs for under $30, it makes more sense to invest in the new one.  </li>
            <li> Quiet, well made, easy, ............</li>
            <li> and it always gets the hair in the first run through, and is very quiet and smooth.</li>
            <li> Professional Super Taper II Hair Clipper 8470</li>
            <li> It certainly gives them a polished and durable</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more powerful than his previous trimmer</li>
            <li> Works great, i had no experience cutting my hair and this made the job easy,</li>
            <li> I feel these are studio quality and cut very even.</li>
            <li> I really recommend it.</li>
            <li> Durable and very convenient to have @ home.</li>
            <li> Very sleek</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> In five minutes I was ready to go.</li>
            <li> The whole thing is going into the garbage can.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re nice and smooth cutting and very quiet and my package got to me very quickly.</li>
            <li> I had an older model of his one before it, but it died on me.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it for beginners.</li>
            <li> I simply love these clippers and I have to get new ones for any reason I&#x27;ll simply get the same ones.</li>
            <li> Be sure to put some of the oil on the clippers every once in a while or your hair will get caught and may be pulled a little.</li>
            <li> As far as the criticism I see, I don&#x27;t really get it.</li>
            <li> I would recomend this product to professional barbers only, because if you are just starting these clippers are advance and you can easily make a mistake with these.</li>
            <li> old clippers used to get really warm and noisy after about 15 minutes of use ( I used to take that long then because I was new to cutting my own hair)</li>
            <li> They are fine for once a month, but not heavy duty enough for daily professional use.</li>
            <li> Rather light weight product compared to two previous Wahl clippers I have purchased.  </li>
            <li> Looks like a professional cut costing $15-$25.  </li>
            <li> I also miss my old box, that had a place for every item.  </li>
            <li> These clippers are not made for thicker, coarse, or very curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Complete set</li>
            <li> My boyfriend cuts his hair himself and had used his old Wahl clippers for over 10 year, I got him this set</li>
            <li> I could see as soon as the director called action</li>
            <li> They are not too loud.</li>
            <li> Wahl is the best hair cutting brand if you ask me and this product doesn&#x27;t let me down.  </li>
            <li> The motor is quiet, and it feels high quality.  </li>
            <li> When I was cutting my hair it gave me a smooth clean cut.</li>
            <li> Save gas, tips, and general fee for get a cut from a barber, which is a luxury.</li>
            <li> Have used it only 2-3 times so far.</li>
            <li> I cut everyone&#x27;s hair in my house including my Old English SheepDog.</li>
            <li> They work fine for regular, not too thick, straighter hair.  </li>
            <li> Still longer hairs sticking up, had to go over the same spots more then 3 or 4 times,  and the darn thing must have jammed up at least 3 times while using.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The blades came with just the right sharpness not sharp enough to nick you and not too dull to cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No excuse as to why this didn&#x27;t cut properly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no haircutter wich means that I use it in average thrice a month; even tough, I find it very easy to use.</li>
            <li> + haircuts without much maintenance at all besides a little bit of clipper oil once a month or so.  </li>
            <li> The combs, on the other hand are very flimsy and a bit sharp at the tips.  </li>
            <li> I was thinking I should probably invest more cash in getting an expensive set that would pay for itself in the long run.</li>
            <li> They are fast and strong, they cut hair like a sharp knife cutting a sheet of paper; I wouldn&#x27;t recomend to those who are just starting, you will have upset customers; this product is meant for the professionals.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t neglect it and it will probably last a very long time.</li>
            <li> While I look at other brands each time I need to replace, the alternatives generally aren&#x27;t offering sufficient value to make a switch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had bad experiences with cheap clippers that give a cheap looking cut and just fall to pieces when you least expect.</li>
            <li> Recently the blades started sticking and getting jammed.</li>
            <li> Hope it lasts as long.</li>
            <li> My last Wahl lasted 16 years and blades just got too dull and it was cheaper to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> My only complain is that the guards seem to be made of lower quality plastic - which is fine, given that youre cutting hair - not shearing wool in the mountains.</li>
            <li> This works very well and cuts very close without cutting yourself.</li>
            <li> This one has everything bouncing around loose in the box.</li>
            <li> So not much portable.</li>
            <li> Its a solid construction, and yet not too heavy.</li>
            <li> To cool off my anger, I started looking at the different sized guards.  </li>
            <li> It is a little on the heavy side but is almost whisper quiet.</li>
            <li> This does the job but for some reason has this issue where it will randomly vibrate the whole unit.</li>
            <li> Unlike my previous el-cheapo haircutting kits, this is a quality product.</li>
            <li> have been using it now bi-weekly for about a year and half and no complaints at all.</li>
            <li> The combs feel a little flimsy, but the cutter itself is made in USA and meet all the expectations</li>
            <li> The combs are a little bendy</li>
            <li> lets just say I&#x27;m a little</li>
            <li> I turned it on a couple of times and the mechanism went dead.  </li>
            <li> Some times clumsy but may prove helpful on other occasions.</li>
            <li> All day long people kept asking me my secret and I showed them my Wahl.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s practically noiseless and you only get a faint hum.</li>
            <li> Had an Oster for about 17 years and wanted something that at least kept some manufacturing in the USA.</li>
            <li> Must use very, very slowly to cut thick hair.</li>
            <li> Really poor blades, would hardly cut</li>
            <li> It causes them to overheat and they become very hard to hold.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a barber, but I use this in between  haircuts for my sons to save a little cash on hair cutting expense.</li>
            <li> so I went to cut his hair and my clipper had a tooth broken off</li>
            <li> It has everything I need to trim my husbands hair including a thin plastic apron!</li>
            <li> My hand goes numb after a minute or two.</li>
            <li> This hair cutting kit gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting hair for years as well.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I had an older model of his one before it, but it died on me. I bought this one thinking it would be better than its older models but they added a protectice bar under the claws so it makes it so you can&#x27;t get as close od a trim as I prefer. If your not looking for a close trim it works great but wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for in trimmers.</li>
            <li> Great product for home use easy to handle I recommend for who want to use it at home good price</li>
            <li> Very good, nice quality.  Now i cut my own hair. F YEAH!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know too much about hair-cutters, but one thing I do know is that I love this hair-cutter.  It doesn&#x27;t get stuck in your hair when you use it.  It cuts very smoothly.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT ! Use it every time to cut my hair (I am a male). PERFECT CUT ! Takes 4 min. Looks like a professional cut costing $15-$25.  SAVING LOTS OF MONEY. Works great. Quiet, well made, easy, ............ etc.</li>
            <li> nice hair trimmer, i had an old one before which used to pull hair when i cut my kids hair, this one cuts all the hair in one shot, kids love it too now</li>
            <li> I love the trimmer itself.  The motor is quiet, and it feels high quality.  The combs, on the other hand are very flimsy and a bit sharp at the tips.  I was tempted to keep the sturdy, round-tipped combs from my old Vidal Sassoon trimmer, but they don&#x27;t quite fit.  I also miss my old box, that had a place for every item.  This one has everything bouncing around loose in the box.</li>
            <li> For the money this is the best you can buy. It has a ton of power and never snags on the thickest of hair.</li>
            <li> Quality product. The combs feel a little flimsy, but the cutter itself is made in USA and meet all the expectations</li>
            <li> Solid clipper with a very strong motor.  I expect many years of service.</li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST Wahl clipper I have owned! It is a little on the heavy side but is almost whisper quiet. It includes everything you need in an at home clipper kit. Cuts very clean every time. It has my vote of 5 * and I would recommend this clipper to anyone.</li>
            <li> Lots of tools. Some times clumsy but may prove helpful on other occasions. Smooth work yet powerful in operation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only drawback is it needs to be plugged on all the time. So not much portable.</li>
            <li> this is the perfect haircutting kit  it saves me money and i can do all sorts of grooming  buy it  its a great price too!!!</li>
            <li> Unlike my previous el-cheapo haircutting kits, this is a quality product. I think it will last a while. Have used it only 2-3 times so far.</li>
            <li> Love these!! They&#x27;re nice and smooth cutting and very quiet and my package got to me very quickly. Very happy.</li>
            <li> My son is in Navy Sea Cadets so has to keep his hair short.  With this set I can easily do it weekly.  VERY easy and it was obvious this is a well made kit</li>
            <li> I feel these are studio quality and cut very even. The kit comes with plenty of guards to accommodate most hair lengths. High quality build with a sturdy feel and excellent handling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a barber, but I use this in between  haircuts for my sons to save a little cash on hair cutting expense.</li>
            <li> Stopped working correctly after a year. Starting yanking out every hundredth hair. It was maddening. I slammed it on my counter until it shattered. Now there is damage to my counter top. I wish i was joking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wahl Five Star Magic Professional Hair Clipper on the other hand has been really really good. I was brave buying the same brand but it worked out.</li>
            <li> I like this. First time I&#x27;ve ever had one. Started cutting my own hair instead of flipping over 20.00 for one. I have my money back in one haircut. Next time I will be saving 20.00. Excellent kit. I really recommend it. Has a very strong sounding motor in it. Don&#x27;t neglect it and it will probably last a very long time.</li>
            <li> The article has a good price, its quality is relatively good, not the best, but it serves very well. For deeper shaved not work as well, but it was a bargain and I recommend it for beginners.</li>
            <li> work great save a lot on hair cuts</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit I was hesitant before getting these. I was thinking I should probably invest more cash in getting an expensive set that would pay for itself in the long run. I&#x27;ve had bad experiences with cheap clippers that give a cheap looking cut and just fall to pieces when you least expect. The Wahl 79524 has been perfect for me. Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I love the chrome finishing on these clippers. It certainly gives them a polished and durable look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weight of the clippers are just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is perfect balance even when you cut for long periods of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades came with just the right sharpness not sharp enough to nick you and not too dull to cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old clippers used to get really warm and noisy after about 15 minutes of use ( I used to take that long then because I was new to cutting my own hair) but these just go on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s practically noiseless and you only get a faint hum. it&#x27;s actually quite soothing for me now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might wonder if there&#x27;s anything I don&#x27;t like about these and the truth is there&#x27;s none. I simply love these clippers and I have to get new ones for any reason I&#x27;ll simply get the same ones. I&#x27;ve even bought one for my dad as a present. I love them that much.</li>
            <li> I bought this simply so i didn&#x27;t have to pay for a haircut when all I had them do was buzz my head. This does the job but for some reason has this issue where it will randomly vibrate the whole unit. It&#x27;s like holding a leaf-blower or something similar. My hand goes numb after a minute or two. Regardless for the price it gets the job done and has already paid for itself in the sense that I didn&#x27;t pay for each haircut.</li>
            <li> Save gas, tips, and general fee for get a cut from a barber, which is a luxury. For all the people, who are struggling financially, this is the best buy you can get. Ergonomic,  smooth-like run, intuitive, and includes the full package.</li>
            <li> I would recomend this product to professional barbers only, because if you are just starting these clippers are advance and you can easily make a mistake with these. They are fast and strong, they cut hair like a sharp knife cutting a sheet of paper; I wouldn&#x27;t recomend to those who are just starting, you will have upset customers; this product is meant for the professionals. You can shave a head in about three minutes with these clippers, thats how strong and powerful these things are.</li>
            <li> Good price with a great package of attachments.</li>
            <li> BEST SHEARS EVER HAD!</li>
            <li> This works very well and cuts very close without cutting yourself. Deluxe set!!!  Thanks for the great price and quality product.</li>
            <li> Wahl is one of the best brand.Durable and very convenient to have @ home.</li>
            <li> Must use very, very slowly to cut thick hair.</li>
            <li> Been using Wahl&#x27;s shaving products for a couple decades, now. Usually last me 5-7 years. While I look at other brands each time I need to replace, the alternatives generally aren&#x27;t offering sufficient value to make a switch. This set&#x27;s another good set</li>
            <li> Outstanding product. I used it for shaving everything, and I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better than this. Had it for about a year now and it always gets the hair in the first run through, and is very quiet and smooth.</li>
            <li> This clipper takes care of all my beard needs perfectly!  Also does a handy job on manscaping, just sayin.</li>
            <li> Love these clippers. They work great, and look really nice too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no haircutter wich means that I use it in average thrice a month; even tough, I find it very easy to use. It feels well in the hand, the materials of wich it is made of seems to be of good quality. Lots of accessories, scissors and an oil for cleaning the razors. I also use it for the beard, for wich it&#x27;s size doesn&#x27;t help much, but it&#x27;s still useful and works as well. Conclusion, good purchase.</li>
            <li> These clippers are not made for thicker, coarse, or very curly hair.  It causes them to overheat and they become very hard to hold.  They work fine for regular, not too thick, straighter hair.  I use the #2 comb on my son&#x27;s hair for a close buzz cut.  They are fine for once a month, but not heavy duty enough for daily professional use.</li>
            <li> Very good for price!! My boyfriend likes how it&#x27;s like the barber style clippers. You plug into the wall. Came with alot of good stuff as well. Pretty good buy.</li>
            <li> Really poor blades, would hardly cut</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had good experiences with wahl products. they seem to last forever.&lt;br /&gt;this product works great and at a very reasonable price, recommended.</li>
            <li> Wahl is the best hair cutting brand if you ask me and this product doesn&#x27;t let me down.  Very sleek and it cuts great.  My last Wahl lasted 16 years and blades just got too dull and it was cheaper to buy a new one.  Best Product</li>
            <li> I have used Wahl products for some time now. This clipper looks great and cuts great. If you cut your own hair, or someone else, this is the product for you. Thanks</li>
            <li> Very quiet, cuts well - all one could hope for for the price.  Bought as a replacement for an old Wahl - very satisfied with this one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set about 2 years ago.  The trimmers worked flawlessly for the 2 years.  Recently the blades started sticking and getting jammed. I thought about purchasing a new set of blades, but when I saw I could purchase a whole new trimmer and combs for under $30, it makes more sense to invest in the new one.  No complaints from me.  I put these clippers through a lot of abuse.  120+ haircuts without much maintenance at all besides a little bit of clipper oil once a month or so.  Thinking of upgrading to the Product Image&lt;br /&gt;Wahl Professional Super Taper II Hair Clipper 8470&lt;br /&gt;by WAHL #8470  but I can&#x27;t imagine how much of a better product these could be.</li>
            <li> Rather light weight product compared to two previous Wahl clippers I have purchased.  Holding up O.K.</li>
            <li> I wud recommend this product. Best clippers I&#x27;ve ever had for the money when it comes to the heating, snagging, and loudness issues.</li>
            <li> I used it and it works great! No complaints. If anything happens I&#x27;ll update my review. I had it for a month now.</li>
            <li> Perfect cut!&lt;br /&gt;No need to spend several times in the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Worth it !!</li>
            <li> For a $25 hair cutting kit, I&#x27;m more than impressed with the guard options.  If you like a nice tight fade, the 0.5, 1, and 1.5 guards allow for a beautiful cut every time.  No other clippers come with such nice guards for the price!</li>
            <li> I hesitated on cutting my own hair but still went ahead and did it anyway and I was very pleased with the great results from this hair cutting kit. When I was cutting my hair it gave me a smooth clean cut. This hair cutting kit gets the job done. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this kit! It has everything I need to trim my husbands hair including a thin plastic apron! It&#x27;s much more powerful than his previous trimmer and I like that it has an electrical plug so I don&#x27;t have to worry about if the battery is charged. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I bought this clipper set for my son for Christmas. He and his friends cut each others hair at University. He is home for the summer so I went to cut his hair and my clipper had a tooth broken off so I used his. It worked beautifully and so I just ordered one for myself. The combs are a little bendy but I don&#x27;t see how that will be a problem.</li>
            <li> Works great, i had no experience cutting my hair and this made the job easy, great manual with tips, easy to use combs and i did a great job on my first try. I would highly recommend it for beginners.</li>
            <li> Ok so 3 stars because it works... but I&#x27;m not going to lie, after reading all of the reviews on this product I was totally excited about buying this for my hubby for christmas as he always complains about his other not working as good. I cut his hair tonight and both him and I were pretty disapointed. Nothing awesome or spectacular. Still longer hairs sticking up, had to go over the same spots more then 3 or 4 times,  and the darn thing must have jammed up at least 3 times while using. lets just say I&#x27;m a little pissed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, my husband had normal, fine hair.I have been cutting hair for years as well. No excuse as to why this didn&#x27;t cut properly.</li>
            <li> Complete set,  i use to cut my and my son&#x27;s (3yo) haircut .. a lot.. a lot of pieces to everything.. to cut, to finishing... it&#x27;s perfect.. don&#x27;t hurt, don&#x27;t pull the hair.. just cut..</li>
            <li> I had purchased smaller kits that took for ever to cut my hair. I am 60 and do not have a lot. This one felt like a barber&#x27;s tool. i can do my own in minutes just like the pros. Temped to use it on the dog. He can get his own!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend cuts his hair himself and had used his old Wahl clippers for over 10 year, I got him this set and it works PERFECT, clean cut, he can adjust to the size he needs and it fits all his old Wahl clip ons. I would definitley recommend this haircutting kit!</li>
            <li> On set we have to shave everything close because the camera doesn&#x27;t lie. We depend on Wahl to get that Pro-Look every time. In five minutes I was ready to go. I could see as soon as the director called action my partner was impressed with my clean cut look and reciprocated appropriately. All day long people kept asking me my secret and I showed them my Wahl. Soon everybody wanted to use it but I insisted they get their own. You can touch anything you want around here but leave my Wahl alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actual review- Really happy with this. Just by holding it and seeing the detail immediately could tell it was a well designed product. Had an Oster for about 17 years and wanted something that at least kept some manufacturing in the USA. Had to turn to Wahl for that. Hope it lasts as long. I suspect it will. Didn&#x27;t need the 27 pieces but it is good to have a few that are suited for my needs. As far as the criticism I see, I don&#x27;t really get it. Must have been talking about something else. Have used it twice. Shaved everything that needed shaving.</li>
            <li> Every tithing was very good Fast shipping I love this works very good.</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened the package and looked at the electrical cord, I had a feeling this product was of inferior quality.  I turned it on a couple of times and the mechanism went dead.  To cool off my anger, I started looking at the different sized guards.  All of them are made of soft, cheap plastic material.  The whole thing is going into the garbage can.  WAHL should be ashamed to claim this is a Made In America, quality product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Brand for the last 10 years. Another good model and the brand to go with.</li>
            <li> The build is great, I own three separate clippers - and this is my new fav. Its a solid construction, and yet not too heavy. Fits well in my palms - and I have used it (successfully) with and without the guards. My only complain is that the guards seem to be made of lower quality plastic - which is fine, given that youre cutting hair - not shearing wool in the mountains. I use mine for a buzz cut and used the #1 - worked fantastically. The powerful motor made the process quick and precise. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Love it.  That is all I can say.  I use it once a month and no issues.</li>
            <li> This shaver works great!</li>
            <li> started making that vibrating noise and sound that some have described here after about two months of using, but then it stopped. have been using it now bi-weekly for about a year and half and no complaints at all.</li>
            <li> Great product, works perfectly.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re very happy with this hair cutter! Thanks very much!</li>
            <li> This is excellent! I cut everyone&#x27;s hair in my house including my Old English SheepDog. I have been using this for over a year and it&#x27;s perfect! When it wears out I will be replacing it with the same product. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> Great clippers, and I have THICK hair, every accessory you could need I can cut my own hair with these rather easily</li>
            <li> Quite operation. Solid construction.</li>
            <li> Great for a simple hair cut. They are not too loud. Be sure to put some of the oil on the clippers every once in a while or your hair will get caught and may be pulled a little. I use it on myself quite often and it get the job done well.</li>
