            <li>The hottest setting on this hair dryer is barely warm.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice dryer.</li>
            <li>Becuase of her actions, I decided to search (where else) but online to Amazon.com for one of my own.  </li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a good dryer, easy to use, great heat settings, but the comb attachment isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li>and it was so EASY!</li>
            <li>Until then, great product ;)</li>

            <li>It is quieter than most and is lightweight.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this hairdryer to anyone. :)</li>
            <li>The reason I am on here is to make sure if something happens to this one.</li>
            <li>The dryer is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Saves me time and my hair feels healthy after drying.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just not in LOVE with the attachment.</li>
            <li>I love this product and it helps me save alot of money now instead of going to the salon</li>
            <li>I use the comb attachment most</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Drying time is pretty good as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still pretty darn good though.</li>
            <li>The dryer reaches a pretty good temperature.</li>
            <li>I purchased this gold n hot to replace one that I loved that broke.</li>
            <li>Great for natural /so curly hair :-)</li>
            <li>And I think it will be just a matter of time before it feels a bit more comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>A lot of dryers have the toggle switch that is easily to turn on when you are blow drying your hair.  </li>
            <li>Comb attachment runs easily through my hair...</li>
            <li>Its straightens my hair so I can easy</li>
            <li>This dryer took a while to warm up when first using it.</li>
            <li>wotrked fine</li>
            <li>It has a setting for any type of hair and it dries quickly!</li>
            <li>The very first time I used this - what a difference it made!  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend!!! :)</li>
            <li>With this blow dryer combined with my Instyler, I have smooth silky hair.  </li>
            <li>This dryer was light in weight and thorough in drying.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li>Light weight, but cheaply made...using this one as a spare.  </li>
            <li>This product fit the bill.</li>
            <li>The plastic quality that its made of is not that great, but its not that big of an issue.  </li>
            <li>A good dryer for a modest price.</li>
            <li>The nozzle gets hot, but unlike some of the dryers I&#x27;ve used, I am able to grab onto it for a controlled blow out of my roots with the pick attachment.  </li>
            <li>i love this dryer, it get really really hot</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll need that hot, but it is so cute and works well.</li>
            <li>love gold and hot tools.</li>
            <li>Outside of those two things I believe this is a really good one.  </li>
            <li>Dries like a pro and true tourmaline effect...</li>
            <li>I honestly prefer my old Conair -</li>
            <li>It is lighter weight, has more controls for heat and air-intensity, and has a much sturdier comb attachment.  </li>
            <li>I kept having to stop to let it cool of for a bit out of fear that it would melt.</li>
            <li>I can see not being able to use the comb attachment for much longer b/c</li>
            <li>I love that the comb is very will attached so there are no worries about it falling off.</li>
            <li>I found this hairdryer on Amazon, and I couldn&#x27;t believe the great price and numerous positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Light and hot.</li>
            <li>It gets very hot and performs well.  </li>
            <li>It puts out good heat, but not wild about the comb attachment.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I love our new dryer.  </li>
            <li>It is very lightweight and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I love this dryer and I am of the opinion that Gold N Hot makes some really neat products and this one is no exception.  </li>
            <li>I stopped doing my hair at home about 10 yrs ago, when I was relaxed, so I rarely ever used a blow dryer and mind you the blow dryer I had</li>
            <li>I also liked that it already came with a comb attachment, as my last one didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>All in all, I am very pleased with this product and look forward to using it for a long time.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews here and they were very positive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect and there&#x27;s different settings from low medium to high.</li>
            <li>Matter of fact, sometimes it was too hot and made my hair very hot to the touch.</li>
            <li>The dryer looked good, but the power cord has a tag attached to it that states, \\&quot;The power cord on this product contains lead, a chemical known to the State of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm.</li>
            <li>I bought this hair dryer because the price was right</li>
            <li>The dryer is light, easy to use, and has multiple heat settings.  </li>
            <li>I am familiar with the Gold N Hot brand which is why I chose this particular dryer.  </li>
            <li>This dryer does not get very hot and it does not straighten hair very well.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too loud and the heat settings are fine.</li>
            <li>Thanks Gold N HoT!</li>
            <li>Even with the &#x27;stop and go&#x27; technique I used, I was still able to dry my hair fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>I started to think even the HIGH setting was just going to give me slightly warm hair, but it eventually got hot enough.</li>
            <li>The comb attachment didn&#x27;t pop off or get hot like my Conair and the teeth on the comb didn&#x27;t dig into my scalp when drying.  </li>
            <li>I can get another one exactly like the one I have.</li>
            <li>In comes the gold n hot dryer with tourmaline.</li>
            <li>This dryer is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>the first time.</li>
            <li>My old hairdryer had a great comb attachment, and it straightens out my shoulder-length hair with little effort.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited to get this hairdryer, I have think course natural hair, so blow drying my hair is a mission.  </li>
            <li>hair was so straight and texture was so good barely had to flat iron.  </li>
            <li>This dryer works fine and seems to dry my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>It does fit comfortably in my hand, even though touching all of the buttons, while holding it, feels a little strange.</li>
            <li>i defiantly recommend this dryer to people with both curly or straight hair.</li>
            <li>I really like the dryer, but I had to take breaks because of the weight of it.</li>
            <li>It is really bent</li>
            <li>I am very satisifed with this product...</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>but i was highly upset that my attachments were not there!</li>
            <li>This works better then I expected.  </li>
            <li>I guess doing to much hair at one time.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Much gentler on the scalp.</li>
            <li>However, I really wanted this product to work, now I&#x27;m looking for yet another dryer.</li>
            <li>this dryer is for the people who have very curly hear to straighten.</li>
            <li>I use the hot setting and it dires my coarse hair so quickly and does not burn my scalp.  </li>
            <li>Save your money and buy a dryer that actually spits out hot air when on the &#x27;hot&#x27; setting!</li>
            <li>The dryer is hot, but I don&#x27;t think its all that quiet as some people mentioned, its no different to most hairdryers.  </li>
            <li>I was so surprised that the hair dryer feels so much lighter than my old one and is much quieter!!  </li>
            <li>I also think the gold and black combo is really cute.</li>
            <li>This blow dryer made it possible for me to even consider blowing out my super coily 4a hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even need to have it on high.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using this type of blow dryer where the heat and the comb get to your roots really quickly reduces your flat ironing time dramatically.  </li>
            <li>I really like the comb attachment, it leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li>I bought this a few months ago and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Love the dryer, gets HOT which my thick, porous hair needs.  </li>
            <li>As a black woman with natural hair and a love of blow outs, I needed a dryer with a strong and durable pick (that wouldn&#x27;t have to be replaced after every other use).</li>
            <li>dried pretty fast getting my hair pretty straight two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I needed a new dryer for quite sometime, but I did not want to pay 50 or 60 dollars for one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s listed on Amazon, but I thought I&#x27;d try something new.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t give it five stars because I would have liked to have a finer tooth comb on the end as this gets the hair even straighter with less time to flat iron and the fact that it smoked.  </li>
            <li>The comb attachment comes off a little too easy</li>
            <li>This Blow dryer is fantastic, it only took me about five minutes to dry my hair.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to try an \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; hair dryer because my hair often gets frizzy if I don&#x27;t blow dry it just right.  </li>
            <li>This hair dyer has cut my flat ironing time by more than half, allowing me to use the comb attachment at my roots has given me smoother finish.</li>
            <li>With my hair type it stays on without me having to duct tape it to work for my natural hair</li>
            <li>but overall this has made hair day so much easier.  </li>
            <li>No frizziness, just soft waves.  </li>
            <li>I am a AA woman with all natural 4a cottony hair.</li>
            <li>Now that I am natural, I do 99% of my hair styling at home and needed something</li>
            <li>My old GnH gave out after 5 years of weekly service.</li>
            <li>I still have the pick from the old dryer.</li>
            <li>This one should last much longer.</li>
            <li>but I do not like the plastic soft comb.</li>
            <li>I like this dryer for natural hair blow outs.</li>
            <li>I am one year and 3months natural.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair.</li>
            <li>I let it cool down before removing the comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I thought if I let it cool down, it would start up again.</li>
            <li>The Conair with the slide on attachments is MUCH lighter and would leave my hair straight enough that I didn&#x27;t have to flat iron.</li>
            <li>I have a big head full of natural hair, and only recently discovered the gold mine of using a comb attachment to save me and my arms hours of drying time.</li>
            <li>If my current one breaks down on me one day, I gladly come back here and purchase another one!</li>
            <li>The brush on the end is what makes it special, and it has lots of power &amp; choices for fast, slow speeds &amp; heats...</li>
            <li>hair dryer works well, not too heavy or loud but dries hair quickly.</li>
            <li>so I have to go over the same spot some extra, and some other reviewers mentioned that its not that strong.  </li>
            <li>The wide tooth comb is what I was really interested in.</li>
            <li>Like another reviewer said the dryer gets very very hot and it even smokes a little on the hottest setting so the comb attachment is made of a plastic that is somewhat flexible.  </li>
            <li>So, I finally ordered a new hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>-dry my hair completely straight</li>
            <li>I bought this hair dryer mainly for the comb attachment and had seen other dyers with such attachments for close to $175, which seemed ridiculous to spend that kind of dough on a hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve decided to go natural which I&#x27;m thinking about going back to relaxers.</li>
            <li>I love this dryer for my tight tight curls.</li>
            <li>I have purchased all kinds of dryers, from cheap to expensive, and this one has worked out very well.  </li>
            <li>I tried buying the universal comb that is available at local beauty suppliers but it kept popping off because my natural 4B/4C hair is very very thick and curly.  </li>
            <li>I am on my third blow dryer of this type as my other two only had concentrators and I really wanted one that came with a comb.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I purchased this gold n hot to replace one that I loved that broke.</li>
            <li> Great for natural /so curly hair :-)</li>
            <li> And I think it will be just a matter of time before it feels a bit more comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> A lot of dryers have the toggle switch that is easily to turn on when you are blow drying your hair.  </li>
            <li> Comb attachment runs easily through my hair...</li>
            <li> Its straightens my hair so I can easy</li>
            <li> This dryer took a while to warm up when first using it.</li>
            <li> wotrked fine</li>
            <li> It has a setting for any type of hair and it dries quickly!</li>
            <li> The very first time I used this - what a difference it made!  </li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend!!! :)</li>
            <li> With this blow dryer combined with my Instyler, I have smooth silky hair.  </li>
            <li> This dryer was light in weight and thorough in drying.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li> Light weight, but cheaply made...using this one as a spare.  </li>
            <li> This product fit the bill.</li>
            <li> The plastic quality that its made of is not that great, but its not that big of an issue.  </li>
            <li> A good dryer for a modest price.</li>
            <li> The nozzle gets hot, but unlike some of the dryers I&#x27;ve used, I am able to grab onto it for a controlled blow out of my roots with the pick attachment.  </li>
            <li> i love this dryer, it get really really hot</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll need that hot, but it is so cute and works well.</li>
            <li> love gold and hot tools.</li>
            <li> Outside of those two things I believe this is a really good one.  </li>
            <li> Dries like a pro and true tourmaline effect...</li>
            <li> I honestly prefer my old Conair -</li>
            <li> It is lighter weight, has more controls for heat and air-intensity, and has a much sturdier comb attachment.  </li>
            <li> I kept having to stop to let it cool of for a bit out of fear that it would melt.</li>
            <li> I can see not being able to use the comb attachment for much longer b/c</li>
            <li> I love that the comb is very will attached so there are no worries about it falling off.</li>
            <li> I found this hairdryer on Amazon, and I couldn&#x27;t believe the great price and numerous positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Light and hot.</li>
            <li> It gets very hot and performs well.  </li>
            <li> It puts out good heat, but not wild about the comb attachment.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love our new dryer.  </li>
            <li> It is very lightweight and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I love this dryer and I am of the opinion that Gold N Hot makes some really neat products and this one is no exception.  </li>
            <li> I stopped doing my hair at home about 10 yrs ago, when I was relaxed, so I rarely ever used a blow dryer and mind you the blow dryer I had</li>
            <li> I also liked that it already came with a comb attachment, as my last one didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> All in all, I am very pleased with this product and look forward to using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews here and they were very positive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect and there&#x27;s different settings from low medium to high.</li>
            <li> Matter of fact, sometimes it was too hot and made my hair very hot to the touch.</li>
            <li> The dryer looked good, but the power cord has a tag attached to it that states, \\&quot;The power cord on this product contains lead, a chemical known to the State of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer because the price was right</li>
            <li> The dryer is light, easy to use, and has multiple heat settings.  </li>
            <li> I am familiar with the Gold N Hot brand which is why I chose this particular dryer.  </li>
            <li> This dryer does not get very hot and it does not straighten hair very well.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too loud and the heat settings are fine.</li>
            <li> Thanks Gold N HoT!</li>
            <li> Even with the &#x27;stop and go&#x27; technique I used, I was still able to dry my hair fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> I started to think even the HIGH setting was just going to give me slightly warm hair, but it eventually got hot enough.</li>
            <li> The comb attachment didn&#x27;t pop off or get hot like my Conair and the teeth on the comb didn&#x27;t dig into my scalp when drying.  </li>
            <li> I can get another one exactly like the one I have.</li>
            <li> In comes the gold n hot dryer with tourmaline.</li>
            <li> This dryer is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> the first time.</li>
            <li> My old hairdryer had a great comb attachment, and it straightens out my shoulder-length hair with little effort.  </li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this hairdryer, I have think course natural hair, so blow drying my hair is a mission.  </li>
            <li> hair was so straight and texture was so good barely had to flat iron.  </li>
            <li> This dryer works fine and seems to dry my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> It does fit comfortably in my hand, even though touching all of the buttons, while holding it, feels a little strange.</li>
            <li> i defiantly recommend this dryer to people with both curly or straight hair.</li>
            <li> I really like the dryer, but I had to take breaks because of the weight of it.</li>
            <li> It is really bent</li>
            <li> I am very satisifed with this product...</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> but i was highly upset that my attachments were not there!</li>
            <li> This works better then I expected.  </li>
            <li> I guess doing to much hair at one time.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Much gentler on the scalp.</li>
            <li> However, I really wanted this product to work, now I&#x27;m looking for yet another dryer.</li>
            <li> this dryer is for the people who have very curly hear to straighten.</li>
            <li> I use the hot setting and it dires my coarse hair so quickly and does not burn my scalp.  </li>
            <li> Save your money and buy a dryer that actually spits out hot air when on the &#x27;hot&#x27; setting!</li>
            <li> The dryer is hot, but I don&#x27;t think its all that quiet as some people mentioned, its no different to most hairdryers.  </li>
            <li> I was so surprised that the hair dryer feels so much lighter than my old one and is much quieter!!  </li>
            <li> I also think the gold and black combo is really cute.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer made it possible for me to even consider blowing out my super coily 4a hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even need to have it on high.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using this type of blow dryer where the heat and the comb get to your roots really quickly reduces your flat ironing time dramatically.  </li>
            <li> I really like the comb attachment, it leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few months ago and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Love the dryer, gets HOT which my thick, porous hair needs.  </li>
            <li> As a black woman with natural hair and a love of blow outs, I needed a dryer with a strong and durable pick (that wouldn&#x27;t have to be replaced after every other use).</li>
            <li> dried pretty fast getting my hair pretty straight two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I needed a new dryer for quite sometime, but I did not want to pay 50 or 60 dollars for one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s listed on Amazon, but I thought I&#x27;d try something new.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t give it five stars because I would have liked to have a finer tooth comb on the end as this gets the hair even straighter with less time to flat iron and the fact that it smoked.  </li>
            <li> The comb attachment comes off a little too easy</li>
            <li> This Blow dryer is fantastic, it only took me about five minutes to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to try an \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; hair dryer because my hair often gets frizzy if I don&#x27;t blow dry it just right.  </li>
            <li> This hair dyer has cut my flat ironing time by more than half, allowing me to use the comb attachment at my roots has given me smoother finish.</li>
            <li> With my hair type it stays on without me having to duct tape it to work for my natural hair</li>
            <li> but overall this has made hair day so much easier.  </li>
            <li> No frizziness, just soft waves.  </li>
            <li> I am a AA woman with all natural 4a cottony hair.</li>
            <li> Now that I am natural, I do 99% of my hair styling at home and needed something</li>
            <li> My old GnH gave out after 5 years of weekly service.</li>
            <li> I still have the pick from the old dryer.</li>
            <li> This one should last much longer.</li>
            <li> but I do not like the plastic soft comb.</li>
            <li> I like this dryer for natural hair blow outs.</li>
            <li> I am one year and 3months natural.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair.</li>
            <li> I let it cool down before removing the comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I thought if I let it cool down, it would start up again.</li>
            <li> The Conair with the slide on attachments is MUCH lighter and would leave my hair straight enough that I didn&#x27;t have to flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have a big head full of natural hair, and only recently discovered the gold mine of using a comb attachment to save me and my arms hours of drying time.</li>
            <li> If my current one breaks down on me one day, I gladly come back here and purchase another one!</li>
            <li> The brush on the end is what makes it special, and it has lots of power &amp; choices for fast, slow speeds &amp; heats...</li>
            <li> hair dryer works well, not too heavy or loud but dries hair quickly.</li>
            <li> so I have to go over the same spot some extra, and some other reviewers mentioned that its not that strong.  </li>
            <li> The wide tooth comb is what I was really interested in.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer said the dryer gets very very hot and it even smokes a little on the hottest setting so the comb attachment is made of a plastic that is somewhat flexible.  </li>
            <li> So, I finally ordered a new hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> -dry my hair completely straight</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer mainly for the comb attachment and had seen other dyers with such attachments for close to $175, which seemed ridiculous to spend that kind of dough on a hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve decided to go natural which I&#x27;m thinking about going back to relaxers.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer for my tight tight curls.</li>
            <li> I have purchased all kinds of dryers, from cheap to expensive, and this one has worked out very well.  </li>
            <li> I tried buying the universal comb that is available at local beauty suppliers but it kept popping off because my natural 4B/4C hair is very very thick and curly.  </li>
            <li> I am on my third blow dryer of this type as my other two only had concentrators and I really wanted one that came with a comb.  </li>
            <li> I found a Gold N Hot one and was about to purchase it when I saw that for $7.00 less there was one in the Amazon Fulfillment Center</li>
            <li> It smooths it out making my flat iron time short.</li>
            <li> and I hope that it will last just as long if not longer than my last one.</li>
            <li> long, I suppose it is designed to work with all different hair lengths and textures.</li>
            <li> I normally need to spend alot of time roll brushing while drying, but that was cut in half!  </li>
            <li> I only use it to dry my fringe and it gets the job done in about 30 seconds or so.</li>
            <li> This has a slide switch which is still easy to maneuver with one hand, but will not shut off by merely holding the dryer.  </li>
            <li> My hair is wavy and fizzy and my morning routine would usually consist of shampoo, condition, leave in conditioner, 3 day straight, blow dry, chi serum, flat iron and then curling iron.  </li>
            <li> previous dryer (different brand) only had a concentrator attachment for blowing out my hair</li>
            <li> Also, it didn&#x27;t take as long to dry my hair which is medium in length and thickness.</li>
            <li> do two strand twist and other such hairstyles.  </li>
            <li> only minus is the comb attachment is starting to bend, but again, my hair is past my shoulders, and super thick!  </li>
            <li> It basically took me 20-30mins to blow dry 5\\&quot; of hair - :</li>
            <li> I am AA with 3b hair and it took about 15 minutes to get it dry.</li>
            <li> It does the job in getting my hair dry without doing a lot of damage to it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So, once my hair is dry it makes it easier to comb through.</li>
            <li> but then that dryer didn&#x27;t dry my hair thoroughly and took forever.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the comb attachment got soft and part of it bent from the heat almost as if it melting.</li>
            <li> barely used 4 times...had a little over a month.  </li>
            <li> I have found that a hairdryer with a comb attachment is so much easier to use than a plain hairdryer and a round brush when drying my hair.  </li>
            <li> would be come slippery due to my hair being wet or from the leave in conditioner which only added to the headache of blowing my hair out.</li>
            <li> dried my relaxed, afro textured hair in 10 minutes flat on the lowest possible setting!</li>
            <li> But this blow dryer has definitely cut down the amount of time spent on my hair.</li>
            <li> the the comb teeth is made from plastic and the comb teeth bent of of shape need to work on a harder plastic for the comb</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s plastic and bendable so it won&#x27;t crack, but the teeth on the comb are too wide to help straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> The comb attachment is slightly to widely spaced for my liking</li>
            <li> Definitely doesn&#x27;t snap off the way the previous ones did, and has a little \\&quot;give\\&quot; when it encounters some resistance (common in my natural hair).</li>
            <li> I swear it took me less than 10 mins to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer to replace an older one that worked poorly.  </li>
            <li> It is HARD to find a dryer that doesn&#x27;t over dry my hair, and actually GOES through my hair.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t regret this purchase, as one of the other reviewers stated...</li>
            <li> Noisy and  extremely flimsy comb attachment.  </li>
            <li> Also that other  hair dryer was not under warrantee (based on reviews) if purchased on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this dryer died after the first usage.</li>
            <li> Previous comb attachments that I&#x27;ve used were made from a harder plastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it will take long each time I use it.</li>
            <li> The comb attchment works find for me as long as I do it in small sections.</li>
            <li> It suited for curly and thick hair, too big to use for me.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> My hair is dry in less than 10 mintues which is a short amount of time as I have very thick hair.</li>
            <li> and I feel like it cut my drying time in half.</li>
            <li> My arm would ache before I was even half way through which caused me to take 2 min breaks in between and during the process the brush handle</li>
            <li> The reviews are telling the truth that the combs DO FLEX unlike the previous model from decades ago, where the combs would break off jaggedly at the smallest hair knot.</li>
            <li> unfortunately it is bendable, not hard placstic.</li>
            <li> it takes me less time to dry my thick hair</li>
            <li> my nature curls are so tight my comb keep coming off.</li>
            <li> I moved away from chemicals and straightening combs a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> my hair needs a firm hand to straighten it out, the bendable tines on this comb frustrate me to no ends...</li>
            <li> a few of the teeth of the comb are permanently bent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black woman with really thick corse hair.</li>
            <li> and I had very little hair loss from using this dryer.</li>
            <li> I had this item less than a Year and the heat bolt died, Now I have to buy a new one :(</li>
            <li> The attachment combs used to be a hard plastic</li>
            <li> It works well and the comb attachment is not the hard, scratchy plastic.</li>
            <li> By that time it was too late to return it.</li>
            <li> No more breaking dryer combs!</li>
            <li> Not good for thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair.</li>
            <li> but definitely less painful when I&#x27;m combing through my hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the comb was brittle and the teeth were breaking off, and I couldn&#x27;t find a replacement for that attachment.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> Totally disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> like that you can control the heat settings (low,med,high) and the cold shot!  </li>
            <li> very disappointed...</li>
            <li> Very Very disappointed in this brand.</li>
            <li> This peice of crap did not come with any attachments!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely hated the comb!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I moved away from chemicals and straightening combs a few years ago.  With this blow dryer combined with my Instyler, I have smooth silky hair.  On humid days, I run through my hair real quick and I&#x27;m good to go!</li>
            <li> I love this! The comb attachment works great and I feel like it cut my drying time in half. I also think the gold and black combo is really cute.</li>
            <li> Love this item with the pik. With my hair type it stays on without me having to duct tape it to work for my natural hair</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love our new dryer.  The comb attachment comes off a little too easy but overall this has made hair day so much easier.  The biggest perk for me is that if the comb ever breaks it will be cheaper and easier to replace then the slide on comb dryers.</li>
            <li> Work great . Comb comes off sometime but my hair is course</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know anything about these things, but thought I would share what my wife had to say.  I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my wife, and she said she loves it. She went on  about the control she has with this dryer, and the speed in which, what is essentially a   chore, is done and over with. It must really be a good one, because I even got a hug.</li>
            <li> It is great. The wide tooth comb is what I was really interested in. I&#x27;ve only used it once but I believe it is great for its price.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer made it possible for me to even consider blowing out my super coily 4a hair. The comb attachment is key and a godsend. Its durable but flexible, so you don&#x27;t stab yourself or fear that you could break it with the next stroke. Drying time is pretty good as well. If it came with a diffuser attachment, it would get 5 stars. It&#x27;s still pretty darn good though.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer because the price was right and I wanted to try an \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; hair dryer because my hair often gets frizzy if I don&#x27;t blow dry it just right.  The very first time I used this - what a difference it made!  No frizziness, just soft waves.  I normally need to spend alot of time roll brushing while drying, but that was cut in half!  I was so surprised that the hair dryer feels so much lighter than my old one and is much quieter!!  You won&#x27;t regret this purchase, as one of the other reviewers stated...I would give it a 6!</li>
            <li> Love the ease the dryer and comb attachments.</li>
            <li> I love love love this  blow dryer. It&#x27;s perfect and there&#x27;s different settings from low medium to high. You won&#x27;t regret it if you buy this.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer specifically for the included comb attachment. unfortunately it is bendable, not hard placstic. my hair needs a firm hand to straighten it out, the bendable tines on this comb frustrate me to no ends...</li>
            <li> OMG i love this dryer, its perfect. the comb defiantly does its job. i defiantly recommend this dryer to people with both curly or straight hair. i love it</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS HAIRDRYER! No more breaking dryer combs! It works great and I had very little hair loss from using this dryer. It gets and A+ in my book!</li>
            <li> The hottest setting on this hair dryer is barely warm.  Totally disappointed with this product.  Save your money and buy a dryer that actually spits out hot air when on the &#x27;hot&#x27; setting!</li>
            <li> I am a AA woman with all natural 4a cottony hair. I stopped doing my hair at home about 10 yrs ago, when I was relaxed, so I rarely ever used a blow dryer and mind you the blow dryer I had was just to get by. Now that I am natural, I do 99% of my hair styling at home and needed something better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous dryer (different brand) only had a concentrator attachment for blowing out my hair so I used it in conjunction with my Aveda denman brush. That was TORTURE! My arm would ache before I was even half way through which caused me to take 2 min breaks in between and during the process the brush handle would be come slippery due to my hair being wet or from the leave in conditioner which only added to the headache of blowing my hair out. It basically took me 20-30mins to blow dry 5\\&quot; of hair - :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this blow dryer 2 weeks ago to blow out my hair using the comb attachment to do mini two strand twists. I swear it took me less than 10 mins to dry my hair. I was so happy and it was so EASY! The reviews are telling the truth that the combs DO FLEX unlike the previous model from decades ago, where the combs would break off jaggedly at the smallest hair knot. I always recommend and practice untangling the hair before blow drying, regardless of the attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary: I HIGHLY recommend!!! :)</li>
            <li> My Conair 1875 Yellowbird has worked for years, but I wanted to try something different and give it to my daughter. This dryer was light in weight and thorough in drying. The comb attachment didn&#x27;t pop off or get hot like my Conair and the teeth on the comb didn&#x27;t dig into my scalp when drying.  Also, it didn&#x27;t take as long to dry my hair which is medium in length and thickness. A good dryer for a modest price.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few months ago and I absolutely love it. It isn&#x27;t too loud and the heat settings are fine. I only use it to dry my fringe and it gets the job done in about 30 seconds or so. If my current one breaks down on me one day, I gladly come back here and purchase another one!</li>
            <li> my only dislike about this blow dryer is the the comb teeth is made from plastic and the comb teeth bent of of shape need to work on a harder plastic for the comb</li>
            <li> I really like the comb attachment, it leaves my hair soft. The dryer reaches a pretty good temperature. Overall, it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li> Use this hairdryer every day and would be lost without it.  The brush on the end is what makes it special, and it has lots of power &amp; choices for fast, slow speeds &amp; heats...It is the only one I will have from now on!!!!</li>
            <li> Noisy and  extremely flimsy comb attachment.  Light weight, but cheaply made...using this one as a spare.  Not good for thick hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair dryer for a week now and I love it.  I bought this hair dryer mainly for the comb attachment and had seen other dyers with such attachments for close to $175, which seemed ridiculous to spend that kind of dough on a hair dryer.  Also that other  hair dryer was not under warrantee (based on reviews) if purchased on Amazon.  While I think the attachment is a bit large/long, I suppose it is designed to work with all different hair lengths and textures. And I think it will be just a matter of time before it feels a bit more comfortable to use.  My hair is wavy and fizzy and my morning routine would usually consist of shampoo, condition, leave in conditioner, 3 day straight, blow dry, chi serum, flat iron and then curling iron.  This hair dyer has cut my flat ironing time by more than half, allowing me to use the comb attachment at my roots has given me smoother finish. Yay!  I also like the on/off switch.  A lot of dryers have the toggle switch that is easily to turn on when you are blow drying your hair.  This has a slide switch which is still easy to maneuver with one hand, but will not shut off by merely holding the dryer.  I highly recommend this hair dryer.  Excellent quality and excellent price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this gold n hot to replace one that I loved that broke. This dryer does not get very hot and it does not straighten hair very well. I would not recommend this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this purchase. I needed a new dryer for quite sometime, but I did not want to pay 50 or 60 dollars for one. It works amazing for the price and as always Amazon is the best!</li>
            <li> I am on my third blow dryer of this type as my other two only had concentrators and I really wanted one that came with a comb.  I tried buying the universal comb that is available at local beauty suppliers but it kept popping off because my natural 4B/4C hair is very very thick and curly.  This one stays on because it clicks into the dryer itself.  Like another reviewer said the dryer gets very very hot and it even smokes a little on the hottest setting so the comb attachment is made of a plastic that is somewhat flexible.  I let it cool down before removing the comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t give it five stars because I would have liked to have a finer tooth comb on the end as this gets the hair even straighter with less time to flat iron and the fact that it smoked.  Outside of those two things I believe this is a really good one.  I sectioned my hair and each section dried pretty fast getting my hair pretty straight two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this type of blow dryer where the heat and the comb get to your roots really quickly reduces your flat ironing time dramatically.  I saw someone on youtube use this type and it does make a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update to my review: December 15th was drying hair and the blower got stuck on one setting.  This dryer will now only blow on the lowest setting...very disappointed...barely used 4 times...had a little over a month.  Purchased replacement Silver Bird by Conair from Sally&#x27;s (2000 Watt)  Dries like a pro and true tourmaline effect...hair was so straight and texture was so good barely had to flat iron.  Very Very disappointed in this brand.</li>
            <li> I was trying to replace my previous wonderful hair dryer - this one is almost as good. Light and hot. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> please!! after 3 uses comb broke and dryer blew the hell up and burntout but seler refunded money with no problem</li>
            <li> This dryer took a while to warm up when first using it. I&#x27;m not sure if it will take long each time I use it. I started to think even the HIGH setting was just going to give me slightly warm hair, but it eventually got hot enough. Matter of fact, sometimes it was too hot and made my hair very hot to the touch. I really like the dryer, but I had to take breaks because of the weight of it. My hand was starting to ache. I am AA with 3b hair and it took about 15 minutes to get it dry. My hair was still a bit frizzy. I honestly prefer my old Conair - [[ASIN:B000JUV816 Conair SD6X, 1875-Watt, 3-in-1 Ionic Styler with 3 Attachments]] I picked up at the drugstore for $15 bucks. It&#x27;s listed on Amazon, but I thought I&#x27;d try something new. The Conair with the slide on attachments is MUCH lighter and would leave my hair straight enough that I didn&#x27;t have to flat iron.</li>
            <li> My old GnH gave out after 5 years of weekly service. As a black woman with natural hair and a love of blow outs, I needed a dryer with a strong and durable pick (that wouldn&#x27;t have to be replaced after every other use). This product fit the bill. I recommend it without reservation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I still have the pick from the old dryer. It is really bent but I still does the trick.</li>
            <li> This blower dryer is great it takes me less time to dry my thick hair I am very satisifed with this product...Thanks</li>
            <li> Excelente producto funciona de maravilla mi madre esta encantada, el envio fue justo a tiempo, tiene buen diseño, precio y facil de usar.</li>
            <li> This peice of crap did not come with any attachments!!! Do not purchase The actually dryer wotrked fine but i was highly upset that my attachments were not there!</li>
            <li> It is only one was to described this. Great! Buy the product and you will find out!  Great for natural /so curly hair :-)</li>
            <li> My old hairdryer had a great comb attachment, and it straightens out my shoulder-length hair with little effort.  Otherwise, my hair would be wavy.  Unfortunately, the comb was brittle and the teeth were breaking off, and I couldn&#x27;t find a replacement for that attachment.  So, I finally ordered a new hair dryer.  It is lighter weight, has more controls for heat and air-intensity, and has a much sturdier comb attachment.  This one should last much longer.</li>
            <li> This serves the purpose but I do not like the plastic soft comb. The attachment combs used to be a hard plastic but now the comb falls off the dryer and I&#x27;m just not a fan of the bending plastic comb..</li>
            <li> I have purchased all kinds of dryers, from cheap to expensive, and this one has worked out very well.  It is quieter than most and is lightweight.  My hair is dry in less than 10 mintues which is a short amount of time as I have very thick hair.</li>
            <li> This works better then I expected.  I like that the comb is sturdy.  The only downfall is that sometimes the comb attachment turns while combing through hair.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is great!  My only compliant would be the comb attachment is a bit flimsy the teeth bent when I was drying my daughters hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this hairdryer specifically for the comb attachment.  I have found that a hairdryer with a comb attachment is so much easier to use than a plain hairdryer and a round brush when drying my hair.  I found this hairdryer on Amazon, and I couldn&#x27;t believe the great price and numerous positive reviews. I am really very pleased with my purchase!  The dryer is light, easy to use, and has multiple heat settings.  The comb attachment works like a dream.  I would recommend this hairdryer to anyone. :)</li>
            <li> I needed a blow dryer with a comb attachment in order to blow out my hair and this dryer is great for the price. My only complaint is that the comb attachment got soft and part of it bent from the heat almost as if it melting. I kept having to stop to let it cool of for a bit out of fear that it would melt. Previous comb attachments that I&#x27;ve used were made from a harder plastic. Even with the &#x27;stop and go&#x27; technique I used, I was still able to dry my hair fairly quickly. I can see not being able to use the comb attachment for much longer b/c a few of the teeth of the comb are permanently bent. Overall it&#x27;s a good dryer, easy to use, great heat settings, but the comb attachment isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li> Hair dryer is lightweight and simply phenomenal.&lt;br /&gt;It dried my relaxed, afro textured hair in 10 minutes flat on the lowest possible setting! (low heat, low airflow)</li>
            <li> I love this dryer for my tight tight curls. It smooths it out making my flat iron time short. I did have to put some glue on the comb b/c my nature curls are so tight my comb keep coming off. I guess doing to much hair at one time. I use the glue you fuse together for car review mirror, I forgot the name of the glue. Well, it works for me and I would not trade this dryer for nothing else. The reason I am on here is to make sure if something happens to this one. I can get another one exactly like the one I have. Thanks</li>
            <li> I had this item less than a Year and the heat bolt died, Now I have to buy a new one :(</li>
            <li> This Blow dryer is fantastic, it only took me about five minutes to dry my hair. I didn&#x27;t even need to have it on high.</li>
            <li> I purchased it for the comb attachment. It suited for curly and thick hair, too big to use for me.&lt;br /&gt;The hair dryer works well, not too heavy or loud but dries hair quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought it in March and didn&#x27;t use it until April.  I used it twice in April and once in May. While I was using it in May, it overheated and stopped working.  I thought if I let it cool down, it would start up again. It didn&#x27;t. By that time it was too late to return it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely hated the comb! I need a comb that can stand up to my hair and this one could not. The dryer is fantastic! It has a setting for any type of hair and it dries quickly!</li>
            <li> Love the dryer! Saves me time and my hair feels healthy after drying. It works well and the comb attachment is not the hard, scratchy plastic. Much gentler on the scalp. The downside is a couple of the teeth of the comb have already bent, thus the 4 star rating. It still works well though.</li>
            <li> I like this dryer for natural hair blow outs. The nozzle gets hot, but unlike some of the dryers I&#x27;ve used, I am able to grab onto it for a controlled blow out of my roots with the pick attachment.  I never blow-dry my hair completely straight--I prefer some body--and this helps me get the length and look I want to prep for two-strand twists.</li>
            <li> I have a big head full of natural hair, and only recently discovered the gold mine of using a comb attachment to save me and my arms hours of drying time. What I didn&#x27;t like in my discovery was the daggone attachment continually snapping off. In comes the gold n hot dryer with tourmaline. I love it. Definitely doesn&#x27;t snap off the way the previous ones did, and has a little \\&quot;give\\&quot; when it encounters some resistance (common in my natural hair). I&#x27;m just not in LOVE with the attachment. From the way it looks, I fear it may not last? But only time will tell. Until then, great product ;)</li>
            <li> I had bought this dryer to replace one that I had and loved for over 10 years.  I am familiar with the Gold N Hot brand which is why I chose this particular dryer.  It is very lightweight and easy to use.  It does the job in getting my hair dry without doing a lot of damage to it.&lt;br /&gt;I like that you can control the heat settings (low,med,high) and the cold shot!  I also liked that it already came with a comb attachment, as my last one didn&#x27;t and I had to search for one that would fit.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like this hair dryer and I hope that it will last just as long if not longer than my last one.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several months to help untangle my coarse hair, after shampooing. It does fit comfortably in my hand, even though touching all of the buttons, while holding it, feels a little strange. This dryer is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black woman with really thick corse hair. I&#x27;ve decided to go natural which I&#x27;m thinking about going back to relaxers. It takes me three hours to do my hair. But this blow dryer has definitely cut down the amount of time spent on my hair. The best thing about this blow dryer is that it comes with a comb. So, once my hair is dry it makes it easier to comb through. Don&#x27;t get me wrong it&#x27;s still nappy but definitely less painful when I&#x27;m combing through my hair. I hope this helps. Good product.</li>
            <li> Love the dryer, gets HOT which my thick, porous hair needs.  Comb attachment runs easily through my hair...only minus is the comb attachment is starting to bend, but again, my hair is past my shoulders, and super thick!  Thanks Gold N HoT!</li>
            <li> I am one year and 3months natural. It is HARD to find a dryer that doesn&#x27;t over dry my hair, and actually GOES through my hair. This is perfect. I love that the comb is very will attached so there are no worries about it falling off. There are different levels so you don&#x27;t have to worry about over drying your hair. It straightens my hair a great deal. I would definitely recommend this dryer. I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li> This is a nice dryer. It puts out good heat, but not wild about the comb attachment. I like that it&#x27;s plastic and bendable so it won&#x27;t crack, but the teeth on the comb are too wide to help straighten my hair. I need a blow dryer that has a good comb to help straighten my hair is this one is not it.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair. The comb attchment works find for me as long as I do it in small sections. If you try bigger sections then the comb attchment may come off. I love this product and it helps me save alot of money now instead of going to the salon</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this hairdryer, I have think course natural hair, so blow drying my hair is a mission.  I use the comb attachment most and I got good quick results.  Its straightens my hair so I can easy do two strand twist and other such hairstyles.  The dryer is hot, but I don&#x27;t think its all that quiet as some people mentioned, its no different to most hairdryers.  The comb attachment is slightly to widely spaced for my liking so I have to go over the same spot some extra, and some other reviewers mentioned that its not that strong.  The plastic quality that its made of is not that great, but its not that big of an issue.  I like this product, very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I use to have a dryer that had several attachments so I had to keep them in the box. This one has only two and I love it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer to replace an older one that worked poorly.  This dryer works fine and seems to dry my hair quickly.  I like the comb attachment that comes with it.  My only gripe with the product is it has some sort of GFI feature in the transformer end of the AC plug that requires you to push a button on it before you can use the switch on the dryer to turn the dryer on.  It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of effort, but it is a pain to have to do this every time you want to use the dryer.  So if your dryer won&#x27;t turn on push the button on the transformer.</li>
            <li> The dryer looked good, but the power cord has a tag attached to it that states, \\&quot;The power cord on this product contains lead, a chemical known to the State of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm. Wash hands after handling.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I had to send it back when I read that.</li>
            <li> I did my research on a series of hair dryers prior to purchasing this. I read the reviews here and they were very positive. As a prime members I always do my best to take advantage of the items that allow free shipping so it was great that this fit the ticket. Unfortunately, this dryer died after the first usage. I turned it on to see if it would work properly and it did...the first time. I tried to use it a day or so later and it wouldn&#x27;t even come on. Very disappointed! Thankfully amazon has great customer service and will be giving me a refund. However, I really wanted this product to work, now I&#x27;m looking for yet another dryer.</li>
            <li> I love it!  It gets very hot and performs well.  I am very pleased with my selection and affordable price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer becuase my water areobic instructor continued to insist that I use her dryer at the end of our class. It was a Revlon brand that was ineffective to drying my hair.  Becuase of her actions, I decided to search (where else) but online to Amazon.com for one of my own.  I found a Gold N Hot one and was about to purchase it when I saw that for $7.00 less there was one in the Amazon Fulfillment Center and I purchased it.  I love this dryer and I am of the opinion that Gold N Hot makes some really neat products and this one is no exception.  The attachments that came with it are a  plus.  I use the hot setting and it dires my coarse hair so quickly and does not burn my scalp.  It&#x27;s not as quiet as my last dryer but then that dryer didn&#x27;t dry my hair thoroughly and took forever.  Soon I will need to get another hair pik becuse the one that was included already has a bent prong.  However that&#x27;s not a big deal when you take in account the $7.00 I initially saved.  Only regret is that this dryer isn&#x27;t smaller and yet that&#x27;s not a big deal but may help someone else toward thier decision on purchasing a dryer.  All in all, I am very pleased with this product and look forward to using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair. This does the job without giving me hair damage. I use it on a Med/High setting (there are two buttons with options). Works great.</li>
            <li> i love this dryer, it get really really hot i don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll need that hot, but it is so cute and works well. this dryer is for the people who have very curly hear to straighten. love gold and hot tools.</li>
