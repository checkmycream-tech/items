            <li>and they are more convenient and cheaper.</li>

            <li>And the price was so cheap for what I got and the individual packs are awesome.....</li>
            <li>This is the 2 nd time ordering, an awesome product for dry overworked hair..definitely a hair saver!</li>

            <li>I have this hair oil in a bottle and use it after washing my hair and I find these tubes very useful for travel.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The dry itchy, feeling of winter is all good now :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a first time user and love this hair serum.  </li>

            <li>It really makes it easy to condition your hair, on the go.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what the package claims it will do!</li>
            <li>I was already familiar with this product, and it was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>This little packets are great for vacation.</li>
            <li>The Agadir hair oil creates a soft manageable and silky smooth flair to my baby fine hair giving it volume.</li>
            <li>This oil really does help my hair stay smooth.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, It makes your hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I love to use it when I straighten my hair or just when I wear it natural.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair a little crunchy sometimes but the size of these things are great and really make it easy to know how much I should put in there.</li>
            <li>but I just can&#x27;t seem to get it right.</li>
            <li>I now use coconut oil in my hair right after showering and it has done wonders.</li>
            <li>It has a light fragrance, and it leaves the hair so very soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>My hair has been so much healthier!</li>
            <li>the first time i used this, i got a sample in the mail</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel soft and smooth not greasy.</li>
            <li>I love the entire Agadir line.</li>
            <li>And such a lovely hair spa smell.</li>
            <li>Tis hair oil is really great at cutting the frizz and making my hair softer and more manageable.  </li>
            <li>I use just a tiny drop on my body and face as well and is being absorbed quickly.  </li>
            <li>I didnt really care to much for it.</li>
            <li>thanks you</li>
            <li>It is a very convenient way to keep and transport this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff AS A TREATMENT.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend !</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth as when I left the house.</li>
            <li>I can use one packet over about 1 week&#x27;s time, so I wish there was some way to seal it closed, but other than that, it is a great product.</li>
            <li>It was delivered quickly for a reasonable price and they gave me a $5.00 coupon off a future order.</li>
            <li>It has made my hair so manageable, and easy to blow dry and curl!</li>
            <li>It gives the hair a healthy shmer without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>, im going to have to buy more, but these 10 tubes will last me since i only use</li>
            <li>A little of this product goes a long way and makes your hair smooth, shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, just a little tricky squeezing all of the product out of the tubes.</li>
            <li>The prices have definitely changed since I first started using it which is always a plus!</li>
            <li>I ordered these oils and completely used one whole packet on my scalp.  </li>
            <li>;, so doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy, just soft and shiny, and ready for another on-the-go heat-straightening if needed.</li>
            <li>Love how long the samples last.</li>
            <li>I cannot live without this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love the way this makes my hair feel...very soft without feeling oily and heavy.</li>
            <li>Kind of messy since you never use an entire packet at once.  </li>
            <li>My hair was either completely frizzy when I used an amount similar to what I use with my other brand, or frizzy but greasy looking when I tried using more.  </li>
            <li>(I put the tube inside my own small container since I have short hair, and I just need a palm size dab....</li>
            <li>I love having these in my travel bag, one has multi uses, makes for extra shine without weighing down</li>
            <li>It left my dry, frizzy, hair feeling so soft, shiny, and smooth.</li>
            <li>The amazing thing is that these little individually wrapped travel tubes are much cheaper per ounce than buying a larger size in a bottle (currently about $1.90/oz).</li>
            <li>WOW ....  </li>
            <li>And no heavy or greasy feel.  </li>
            <li>I travel frequently and these tubes take up no room in my toiletry bag.</li>
            <li>After that initial treatment, I do not have to use as much, with continued use, my scalp problem has been solved.</li>
            <li>I just really didn&#x27;t notice that big of a difference.  </li>
            <li>my hair feels soft my hold family used it</li>
            <li>I have been using argan oil for a couple of years now, and find that it works really quite well, but didn&#x27;t want to take a big bottle of it on a trip to Maui, so I tried this brand.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this oil and the small packets work for me!</li>
            <li>Caution, a little goes a long way :)</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and shiny like no other product ever has.  </li>
            <li>Smoothed my hair and left it soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>have naturally curly hair and fight the frizz battle constantly!  </li>
            <li>Nice and thick oil (not watered down like the &#x27;spray&#x27; ones).</li>
            <li>I have very thick and curly hair that I style straight and smooth with blow drying and a flat iron.  </li>
            <li>If using daily only use a little, fragrance can be a little strong if use to much.</li>
            <li>one pack is too much for one use, so I share this with other ladies at lounge all the time they ask me where I get this from.</li>
            <li>(she&#x27;s adopted, full blood Korean with thick curly hair).</li>

            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> This little packets are great for vacation.</li>
            <li> The Agadir hair oil creates a soft manageable and silky smooth flair to my baby fine hair giving it volume.</li>
            <li> This oil really does help my hair stay smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, It makes your hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I love to use it when I straighten my hair or just when I wear it natural.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair a little crunchy sometimes but the size of these things are great and really make it easy to know how much I should put in there.</li>
            <li> but I just can&#x27;t seem to get it right.</li>
            <li> I now use coconut oil in my hair right after showering and it has done wonders.</li>
            <li> It has a light fragrance, and it leaves the hair so very soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> My hair has been so much healthier!</li>
            <li> the first time i used this, i got a sample in the mail</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel soft and smooth not greasy.</li>
            <li> I love the entire Agadir line.</li>
            <li> And such a lovely hair spa smell.</li>
            <li> Tis hair oil is really great at cutting the frizz and making my hair softer and more manageable.  </li>
            <li> I use just a tiny drop on my body and face as well and is being absorbed quickly.  </li>
            <li> I didnt really care to much for it.</li>
            <li> thanks you</li>
            <li> It is a very convenient way to keep and transport this product.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff AS A TREATMENT.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend !</li>
            <li> My hair is smooth as when I left the house.</li>
            <li> I can use one packet over about 1 week&#x27;s time, so I wish there was some way to seal it closed, but other than that, it is a great product.</li>
            <li> It was delivered quickly for a reasonable price and they gave me a $5.00 coupon off a future order.</li>
            <li> It has made my hair so manageable, and easy to blow dry and curl!</li>
            <li> It gives the hair a healthy shmer without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> , im going to have to buy more, but these 10 tubes will last me since i only use</li>
            <li> A little of this product goes a long way and makes your hair smooth, shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li> Love this product, just a little tricky squeezing all of the product out of the tubes.</li>
            <li> The prices have definitely changed since I first started using it which is always a plus!</li>
            <li> I ordered these oils and completely used one whole packet on my scalp.  </li>
            <li> ;, so doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy, just soft and shiny, and ready for another on-the-go heat-straightening if needed.</li>
            <li> Love how long the samples last.</li>
            <li> I cannot live without this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my hair feel...very soft without feeling oily and heavy.</li>
            <li> Kind of messy since you never use an entire packet at once.  </li>
            <li> My hair was either completely frizzy when I used an amount similar to what I use with my other brand, or frizzy but greasy looking when I tried using more.  </li>
            <li> (I put the tube inside my own small container since I have short hair, and I just need a palm size dab....</li>
            <li> I love having these in my travel bag, one has multi uses, makes for extra shine without weighing down</li>
            <li> It left my dry, frizzy, hair feeling so soft, shiny, and smooth.</li>
            <li> The amazing thing is that these little individually wrapped travel tubes are much cheaper per ounce than buying a larger size in a bottle (currently about $1.90/oz).</li>
            <li> WOW ....  </li>
            <li> And no heavy or greasy feel.  </li>
            <li> I travel frequently and these tubes take up no room in my toiletry bag.</li>
            <li> After that initial treatment, I do not have to use as much, with continued use, my scalp problem has been solved.</li>
            <li> I just really didn&#x27;t notice that big of a difference.  </li>
            <li> my hair feels soft my hold family used it</li>
            <li> I have been using argan oil for a couple of years now, and find that it works really quite well, but didn&#x27;t want to take a big bottle of it on a trip to Maui, so I tried this brand.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this oil and the small packets work for me!</li>
            <li> Caution, a little goes a long way :)</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and shiny like no other product ever has.  </li>
            <li> Smoothed my hair and left it soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> have naturally curly hair and fight the frizz battle constantly!  </li>
            <li> Nice and thick oil (not watered down like the &#x27;spray&#x27; ones).</li>
            <li> I have very thick and curly hair that I style straight and smooth with blow drying and a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> If using daily only use a little, fragrance can be a little strong if use to much.</li>
            <li> one pack is too much for one use, so I share this with other ladies at lounge all the time they ask me where I get this from.</li>
            <li> (she&#x27;s adopted, full blood Korean with thick curly hair).</li>
            <li> when i flat iron my hair.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and one of these tubes contains several applications.</li>
            <li> Was expecting a package of them like last time and got 10 loose ones only reason it  didn&#x27;t get a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> Keeps hair from breaking from flat iron!</li>
            <li> I have an extremely dry itchy scalp; especially in the winter time.  </li>
            <li> I have dry hair, and needed and oil that would moisturize, but not make my hair gross.</li>
            <li> Only downfall is that you need a paperclip to keep it closed to save.</li>
            <li> and I have long hair.</li>
            <li> I have used BioSilk in the past and am well aware a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have also used this before I blow dry</li>
            <li> no oily residue appears on my hair when dry.  </li>
            <li> If you have dry, damaged hair, I would recommend you use this product.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat dry, wavy hair that I straighten.  </li>
            <li> The package once opened as it&#x27;s in single sachets</li>
            <li> when you put this on your hair, your hair will feel like silk, I have long hair, and I use about 1/4 of the tube or less, I put it on my hand and rub my hands together then rub it on my hair, whats left on my hands</li>
            <li> My hair is really long (mid back length) and I like the fact that this oil doesn&#x27;t ruin the back of my blouses with greasy stains since I usually wear my hair down.</li>
            <li> and her hair is very dry.</li>
            <li> I use an amount roughly the size of a 10 cent piece -</li>
            <li> They never shipped my small bottle, which apparently was supposed to be fulfilled by the company not Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I take one packet and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It is not oily at all like a lot of other hair oils.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for several years and it always leaves my hair moisturized without it being heavy or looking greasy!</li>
            <li> As a reference I did use it for a couple of weeks every other day.  </li>
            <li> It smells heavenly and just a little goes a long way in making your hair managable and so shiny!  </li>
            <li> Also, the tubes seem to last longer than the bottle I&#x27;ve bought in the past</li>
            <li> I then used a few drops on my DRY hair ...</li>
            <li> but it is hard to store once you open the packets</li>
            <li> Goes a long way, a few drops a day!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be scared about it being an &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; it does not weigh your hair down at all.</li>
            <li> , I have found another product that is less greasy.</li>
            <li> I did not put a lot on - less than a dime size</li>
            <li> Then is was less noticeable, but until then, it is awful!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This stuff made my hair feel a little greasy.</li>
            <li> Some were cut a little and leaked out.  </li>
            <li> I just put a little in my hand, spread thru my hair and brush.</li>
            <li> My ends dried smoother and my hair sleeker.</li>
            <li> My clients get a few uses from each tube.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten a few co workers wanting some.  </li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t wear it everyday.</li>
            <li> I do place a small clip on it to keep it sealed.</li>
            <li> I put mine in a small zip lock bag to avoid a leak problem once opened.</li>
            <li> , I ordered these travel sizes and a small bottle to use at home.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy a 4 oz.</li>
            <li> I wanted these small packs to take on vacation, and I do like that the packaging is so portable.  </li>
            <li> My hair is past the shoulder in length, layered, colored and thick.</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair and a common problem is combating dullness, dryness, and split ends.</li>
            <li> Virginia&#x27;s humid spring and summer weather is not kind to those of us with curly hair that tends to frizz with the slightest of humidity.</li>
            <li> However, it has a terrible scent and really didn&#x27;t work for frizz control like my usual brand of argan oil</li>
            <li> Not great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s our secret.</li>
            <li> I was not happy.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I placed another order IMMEDIATELY.  </li>
            <li> and so do I, sorry I have not reviewed sooner....</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The is the best products ever</li>
            <li> This oil gives my hair shine and body.  It separates the hair enough to distinguish my highlights and create interest.</li>
            <li> Same great product as in bottle. Only downfall is that you need a paperclip to keep it closed to save. Truly wish they would redisign the packaging.</li>
            <li> Love this product, just a little tricky squeezing all of the product out of the tubes. Especially when your hands are slippery from the oil.</li>
            <li> My daughter actually shared some of her Agadir Hair Oil with me.  What a difference it made.  Smoothed my hair and left it soft and shiny.  I ordered the shampoo and conditioner and the OIL Spray Treatment because I liked this product so well.  My daughter&#x27;s hair stylist recomended this to her for her hair.</li>
            <li> I have coarse, frizzy, curly hair that needs some taming.  Tis hair oil is really great at cutting the frizz and making my hair softer and more manageable.  Plus the smell is terrific!</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair and a common problem is combating dullness, dryness, and split ends. This brand of argan oil does an excellent job of making my hair feel soft and look great! My hair feels so silky and has instant shine using this product. It does exactly what the package claims it will do! I have also used this before I blow dry and my results have gone from good to great with this product. My ends dried smoother and my hair sleeker.</li>
            <li> I was already familiar with this product, and it was exactly what I was looking for.  Shipment was very prompt, and I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best product for my hair and this size is so handy to traveling!  It really makes it easy to condition your hair, on the go.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Cheapest way of obtaining the product in Australia was via Amazon.  I use an amount roughly the size of a 10 cent piece - no oily residue appears on my hair when dry.  One tube of the Hair Oil would last for maybe 8 to 10 applications in my case.</li>
            <li> when you put this on your hair, your hair will feel like silk, I have long hair, and I use about 1/4 of the tube or less, I put it on my hand and rub my hands together then rub it on my hair, whats left on my hands I wipe my hands together like I had lotion on them. your hands will feel like silk too.  Great stuff, it will make your hair shine and look like you went to the salon.</li>
            <li> I just tried this product.  It does leave your hair feeling like silk and gives it a great shine.  I have very thick and curly hair that I style straight and smooth with blow drying and a flat iron.  I applied the product to my damp hair according to the instructions.  I then used a few drops on my DRY hair ... WOW ....  what an amazing shine and feel to the hair.  And no heavy or greasy feel.  It smells great, too.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> have tried many oils. this is my favorite, small amt goes along way, smells nice, does not make my hair look greasy, love the tubes</li>
            <li> I have this hair oil in a bottle and use it after washing my hair and I find these tubes very useful for travel.  The oil itself is really good to condition my hair and leave it with a lovely shine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first time user and love this hair serum.  Smells incredible.  Makes my hair soft and shiny like no other product ever has.  It absorbs quickly.  I&#x27;m so glad to have found this oil.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, It makes your hair so soft and shiny. I love to use it when I straighten my hair or just when I wear it natural.</li>
            <li> This product is just as the description said it would be. My hair is smoother, even after using hairgel, and it smells good too. It is not oily at all like a lot of other hair oils.  I use just a tiny drop on my body and face as well and is being absorbed quickly.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for several years and it always leaves my hair moisturized without it being heavy or looking greasy! The prices have definitely changed since I first started using it which is always a plus! Shipping was quick!</li>
            <li> This little packets are great for vacation. It makes your bag lighter and hair shinny and silky. I take one packet and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> These are absolutely perfect for traveling!</li>
            <li> I give these to my clients to promote the sales and usage of the Agadir Argon Oil line of hair care products. My clients get a few uses from each tube. I love this product, and so do my clients. My order arrived on time, in perfect condition. I would not hesitate to use this seller again in the future.</li>
            <li> Not great. I didnt really care to much for it. It was to oily and liquidy. I ended up buying Biosilk instead. I&#x27;ll use these for travel.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this twice now.  I love the smell and how easy it makes my hair to de-tangle.  It also protects it quite a bit from any styling that I do.  My hair has been so much healthier!</li>
            <li> the first time i used this, i got a sample in the mail and i fell in love. it made my hair feel so beautiful curly and straight. i love it, im going to have to buy more, but these 10 tubes will last me since i only use when i flat iron my hair.</li>
            <li> love love love love love ...let me count the ways. It does everything from fix hair, skin, instant mani / pedi when i rubbed it on my hands and feet mixed with salt. AWESOME perfume....I wish there were an actual perfume of this scent!! it&#x27;s a freakin miracle product that smells like a dream within a dream!!! I LOVE IT !!! And the price was so cheap for what I got and the individual packs are awesome.....LOVVVVEEE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> Was expecting a package of them like last time and got 10 loose ones only reason it  didn&#x27;t get a 5 star rating. I love having these in my travel bag, one has multi uses, makes for extra shine without weighing down unless you overdo then you&#x27;ll be greased up lol.</li>
            <li> I travel frequently and these tubes take up no room in my toiletry bag. I have long hair and one of these tubes contains several applications.</li>
            <li> The product was just what I ordered. It was delivered quickly for a reasonable price and they gave me a $5.00 coupon off a future order.</li>
            <li> Great product! Love it! And way cheaper than buying it off the hairstylist or in the store. Makes my hair nice and sleek and prevent the damage from ironing</li>
            <li> very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> Liked the oil but it is hard to store once you open the packets</li>
            <li> Virginia&#x27;s humid spring and summer weather is not kind to those of us with curly hair that tends to frizz with the slightest of humidity. This oil really does help my hair stay smooth. A great price and easy to slip this travel size into your purse, just in case. Caution, a little goes a long way :)</li>
            <li> Love this product. Makes my hair feel soft and smooth not greasy.</li>
            <li> I have an extremely dry itchy scalp; especially in the winter time.  I ordered these oils and completely used one whole packet on my scalp.  MIRACLE!!!!!!!  Needless to say, I placed another order IMMEDIATELY.  This is a product that I WILL NOT RUN OUT OF.  After that initial treatment, I do not have to use as much, with continued use, my scalp problem has been solved.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this oil and the small packets work for me! The individually wrapped packets give me the convenience that I need!</li>
            <li> me and my mom use this product at home always.&lt;br /&gt;this is perticularity good for travelling or going to golf. one pack is too much for one use, so I share this with other ladies at lounge all the time they ask me where I get this from.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my Mom who swears by this serum.  So I&#x27;m writing on her behalf.</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my hair feel...very soft without feeling oily and heavy. I&#x27;ve gotten a few co workers wanting some.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Really excellent treatment for my hair, my hair thanks you and so do I, sorry I have not reviewed sooner....love love love</li>
            <li> This is the best argan oil there are so many brands and different companies out here but this one is the best</li>
            <li> I bought this in August, after having it put in my hair at a salon.  I am still using the 1st tube I opened.  A little of this product goes a long way and makes your hair smooth, shiny and healthy.  It leaves no greasy film on your hair or hands either.  If your thinking of buying Argon Oil, this is the best way to go.</li>
            <li> This oil is great for hot oil treatment after washing hair. My beautician loves it. If using daily only use a little, fragrance can be a little strong if use to much. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This smells divine and works as well as more expensive products.  The great thing is the packaging, which is durable, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about it spilling in my luggage.</li>
            <li> ONE OF THE BEST CONDITIONER TREATMENTS EVER.  I ALSO LOVE THE SMALL TRAVEL TUBES SINCE YOU CAN JUST GRAB A FEW AND GO!</li>
            <li> Great smell, but just too much oil. Great sheen to my hair, I have found another product that is less greasy.</li>
            <li> It is a very convenient way to keep and transport this product. I can have it in my purse and use it any time. I do place a small clip on it to keep it sealed.</li>
            <li> 5 stars!! ***** I cannot live without this stuff. I love the entire Agadir line. The Agadir hair oil creates a soft manageable and silky smooth flair to my baby fine hair giving it volume. It makes it feel and smell fabulous. It adds shine without greasiness. My hair feels healthier and fuller. My husband even commented on how nice my hair looks. My sisters are like what are you doing different to your hair?? Shhh--It&#x27;s our secret. Buy it- you&#x27;ll fall in love with your hair.</li>
            <li> Goes a long way, a few drops a day!</li>
            <li> My wife uses this regularly in her hair, and she loves  it. The amazing thing is that these little individually wrapped travel tubes are much cheaper per ounce than buying a larger size in a bottle (currently about $1.90/oz). Also, if you do travel, these travel tubes are safer for your luggage and much more convenient.</li>
            <li> Is the best,Agadir Hair Oil.I love it.Thanks</li>
            <li> great for travel.  I put mine in a small zip lock bag to avoid a leak problem once opened.</li>
            <li> Works really good on my hair. Great product!</li>
            <li> LOVED this product. It left my dry, frizzy, hair feeling so soft, shiny, and smooth. I wont go a day without this anymore!</li>
            <li> Wonderful hair oil--light, none greasy, absorbent.  It has a light fragrance, and it leaves the hair so very soft and manageable.  Excellent product!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this.  She says it was a good buy.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair a little crunchy sometimes but the size of these things are great and really make it easy to know how much I should put in there. Truly appreciate this</li>
            <li> Love this product! It&#x27;s so good to my hair!! Love how long the samples last. So worth the purchase! Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff AS A TREATMENT. I will put it in my hair 30 minutes before I shampoo and it does make my hair softer and shinier but I can&#x27;t wear it everyday. I played with the amounts I put in my hair but I just can&#x27;t seem to get it right. Maybe it&#x27;s a user error. I now use coconut oil in my hair right after showering and it has done wonders.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this oil by my hair dresser. I have dry hair, and needed and oil that would moisturize, but not make my hair gross. She gave me samples of his oil, and it works amazingly. I now use it daily, along with the shampoo &amp; conditioner. Not only oes it do a magnificent job, it smells fabulous! It does cost a bit, but you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it. If you have dry, damaged hair, I would recommend you use this product. It really is great.</li>
            <li> My daughter is biracial (W/B) and her hair is very dry. However, I always get complimented on how well I take care of her hair, how great it smells (the smell is soft), and how shiny it is. I also gave a sample to my cousin (she&#x27;s adopted, full blood Korean with thick curly hair). She was super impressed and ordered some for herself. I highly recommend it! I&#x27;ve never been able to make her hair feel oily with this.</li>
            <li> I purchased on the advice of my hairdresser.  She even specified the brand. I have somewhat dry, wavy hair that I straighten.  This stuff made my hair feel a little greasy. I did not put a lot on - less than a dime size and I have long hair. I have used BioSilk in the past and am well aware a little goes a long way.  I just really didn&#x27;t notice that big of a difference.  As a reference I did use it for a couple of weeks every other day.  It wasn&#x27;t a one time application.  Additional note, I ordered these travel sizes and a small bottle to use at home.  They never shipped my small bottle, which apparently was supposed to be fulfilled by the company not Amazon.  Amazon propmptly refunded me.</li>
            <li> excellent hair oil.  no problems with seller</li>
            <li> Great product and if the family loves it, I do say it for other to know.&lt;br /&gt;The dry itchy, feeling of winter is all good now :)</li>
            <li> will order again I use this product every week .</li>
            <li> I love all the Agadir hair products. They smell so good and make my hair look &amp; feel great. Awesome!</li>
            <li> This is the 2 nd time ordering, an awesome product for dry overworked hair..definitely a hair saver! I highly recommend !</li>
            <li> Nice smell and makes the hair looks shiny. The package once opened as it&#x27;s in single sachets takes upto 3 weeks to finish so the storage</li>
            <li> Excellent oil treatment it leaves my hair shine</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It smells heavenly and just a little goes a long way in making your hair managable and so shiny!  My hairdresser had a sample and used it on my hair about a year ago.  After that, I tried to purchase it and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. I&#x27;m so happy that Amazon had it.  I would highly recommend this product for frizz free, managable hair!!</li>
            <li> For travel.  Kind of messy since you never use an entire packet at once.  I can use one packet over about 1 week&#x27;s time, so I wish there was some way to seal it closed, but other than that, it is a great product.</li>
            <li> I love this produce on my hair my hair feels soft my hold family used it and I used the oil on my skin</li>
            <li> like the product. shine for my hair as promised. tubes are convenient for use. My hair needs just a little-couple drops on your hand and rub your hands together. Then apply to damp hair, and style.</li>
            <li> I have been buying Agadir Moroccan oil for several years. I usually buy a 4 oz. bottle. A little goes a long way. Now I&#x27;m about out and found these travel tubes to be a much better deal than repurchasing the 4 oz. bottle. I&#x27;m always one who loves to save money! OH, and this product smells fabulous and works wonders for my curly / frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I wanted these small packs to take on vacation, and I do like that the packaging is so portable.  One of the packs would last me for about three or four days.  However, it has a terrible scent and really didn&#x27;t work for frizz control like my usual brand of argan oil does.  The scent seemed very strong to me until it dried/absorbed.  Then is was less noticeable, but until then, it is awful!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally curly hair and fight the frizz battle constantly!  I have been using argan oil for a couple of years now, and find that it works really quite well, but didn&#x27;t want to take a big bottle of it on a trip to Maui, so I tried this brand.  My hair was either completely frizzy when I used an amount similar to what I use with my other brand, or frizzy but greasy looking when I tried using more.  I was not happy.</li>
            <li> I have been using Agadir since 2006 and I never, ever am without it! It has made my hair so manageable, and easy to blow dry and curl! Don&#x27;t be scared about it being an &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; it does not weigh your hair down at all. My hair is past the shoulder in length, layered, colored and thick. And it works beautifully! try it!</li>
            <li> These are perfect for trips.  But I will tell you, put them all in a zip lock baggie.  Some were cut a little and leaked out.  One tube is enough for 2 treatments.</li>
            <li> I used this product along with Marrakesh oil on my sisterlocks and it seems to soften them a bit. My hair is really long (mid back length) and I like the fact that this oil doesn&#x27;t ruin the back of my blouses with greasy stains since I usually wear my hair down. Also, the tubes seem to last longer than the bottle I&#x27;ve bought in the past and they are more convenient and cheaper.</li>
            <li> Love!!  Keeps hair from breaking from flat iron!</li>
            <li> Convenient to have in travel bag (I put the tube inside my own small container since I have short hair, and I just need a palm size dab.... so about 5-6 &amp;#34;dabs&amp;#34; per tube).&lt;br /&gt;Less hassle than carrying the larger size bottles. Smells good.  Nice and thick oil (not watered down like the &#x27;spray&#x27; ones). Not at all greasy like &amp;#34;regular oil&amp;#34;, so doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy, just soft and shiny, and ready for another on-the-go heat-straightening if needed.</li>
            <li> Especially love the scent and feel of this product. It gives the hair a healthy shmer without weighing it down. And such a lovely hair spa smell.</li>
            <li> Great for when I am out and the humidity hits. I just put a little in my hand, spread thru my hair and brush. My hair is smooth as when I left the house.</li>
