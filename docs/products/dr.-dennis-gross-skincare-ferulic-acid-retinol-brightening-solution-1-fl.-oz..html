            <li>I&#x27;ve been real happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy to have discovered this product!</li>
            <li>Great Product!</li>
            <li>This is great when paired with the peel!</li>
            <li>but when I started using the peel with the brightening solution, I am very happy to say my skin looks great!!</li>
            <li>great stuff, have used it before</li>
            <li>While I am happy with this product I switched to the ole henriksen anti-aging (3 wonders skin collection</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great addition to my decleor products and keeps your skin feeling &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>Great product, my skin is glowing.  </li>
            <li>the price is great on Amazon and If it was not causing me to break out I wouldve kept it.</li>
            <li>what fantastic results!!!</li>
            <li>Very nice product.  </li>
            <li>looking good, it will.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had good skin and never had a problem with acne.  </li>
            <li>This prodcut makes your face looks sooo good.</li>
            <li>I use this every morning after washing my face and before applying a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and I have put my beloved Chanel away for now, I don&#x27;t think it improves on my complection after using this.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>but you can buy extras at the drug store - not as good as what&#x27;s in the box</li>
            <li>If using in the morning, follow with a really good sunscreen...</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product since a</li>
            <li>Glad to be using it again!</li>
            <li>Really love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>This solution really does brighten up your skin and gives it a wonderful feel.  </li>
            <li>I must be honest though -</li>
            <li>Gives skin a nice radiance.</li>
            <li>So, so nice.</li>
            <li>use this in conjunction with the Extra Strength Alpha Beta peel, 2x/day, and I am quite impressed and happy with the results.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!!</li>
            <li>This one is by far the best I have used.</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin bright, smooth.</li>
            <li>and honestly my skin is the best it ever looked; clear and healthy.</li>
            <li>Without exfoliation or some kind of peel, you will get no results because the serum won&#x27;t be able to penetrate the most exterior layers</li>
            <li>I might surely reorder again but I do hesitate cause of the price</li>
            <li>but I think good Retinol is worth the splurge</li>
            <li>Love this product,have used it before and it works.</li>
            <li>It appears to be smoothing out y skin and refreshing the cells</li>
            <li>and I figured now is the time to start using anti-aging products! :)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll have better results than today.</li>
            <li>My skin looked noticeably better.</li>
            <li>This product has eliminated most of my brown spots on my face.  </li>
            <li>a daily necessity to look my best,</li>
            <li>I also find the serum particularly effective after my biweekly at home chemical peel (lunch/ superficial light peels like salicylic acid or lactic acid).</li>
            <li>luck! :)</li>
            <li>but I thought it would work better.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>I love the microfiber pads used for application.</li>
            <li>Even after carefully cleaning my face, this product will stlll remove more dirt which is impressive.  </li>
            <li>I like how easy it is to use.  </li>
            <li>but they work fine.  </li>
            <li>I originally received a free trial size of this product with a purchase from another site and was so pleased with the results I was seeing that I purchased a full size bottle.  </li>
            <li>Was using the extra strength alpha beta peels and added this in;  this made an amazing product twice as effective in treating acne, marks and giving an all over glow.  1 star off for the inclusion of phenoxyethanol as a preservative.  </li>
            <li>So to sum up my point: goes on smoothly, glowy skin and no greasy effect at all.</li>
            <li>Fabulous.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a long time and it is great.  </li>
            <li>this is a good product, and these do actually work if used...</li>
            <li>most people expect results in a day, and those products just dont really work.  </li>
            <li>I bought another sample size just to see and have now, thru Amazon (cheapest I&#x27;ve found over sephora and ebay) purchased the full bottle size</li>
            <li>Not a bad product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
            <li>I have tried other high quality serums and this is the best.</li>
            <li>Dr Gross&#x27;s products are great &amp; really work you will get results with this product.</li>
            <li>I got a free sample of this product and liked it enough to buy it.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin look photo ready, makeup optional, afterglow fabulous.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>And even though this is a 1-oz bottle, I use it fairly generously (10-ish drops on a half-pad), and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll last me several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Ferulic Acid and Retinol Brightening solution is effective in improving the complexion as well as the the overall  tone of skin.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>If you want something that just really brightens your skin and gives you a younger healthy look - this is definitly for you!</li>
            <li>I like it very much and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>maybe one more bottle before I make a final determination if I like the product or not.</li>
            <li>the type willing to commit.</li>
            <li>I love that I can get ferulic acid and retinol in the same product!  </li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve observed similar or better results).</li>
            <li>The first morning I looked so haggard, with ALL my wrinkles seeming deeper</li>
            <li>and my whole face darker and O.L.D!</li>
            <li>I use it about 3 times a week at night because it can be drying, but not uncomfortably.</li>
            <li>I must say this is the first serum that I use and really like very much.</li>
            <li>This product is gentle and overall I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>So, if you have problem skin, I&#x27;m not sure if this product is good for you.  </li>
            <li>It has helped diminish pore size on my nose and overall improved the clarity of my skin making it look clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>But, because I received the open bottle and couldn&#x27;t find easy way to exchange or return it, I have to throw it away.  </li>
            <li>This is a fine skin product and I can see a definite lift to my skin.</li>
            <li>I also got my mom and older sister hooked!</li>
            <li>Initially, I was excited to try a brightening serum and after reading positive results on their website, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Avon peels and glycolic acid resurfacing serum, 30% salicylic and glycolic acid peels, a whole slew of alpha hydroxy products, prescription retinoids, over the counter acne medication, tea tree oil, and the list goes on.</li>
            <li>but I probably spent more money on cheaper and subpar products that never worked.</li>
            <li>Something important to note is that this serum will not work at all if you haven&#x27;t exfoliated recently.</li>
            <li>This product was recommended by a sales person who is attached to Sephora in NYC...and was very sceptical to purchase as nothing I have used over the years has lightened the brown spots on my face...</li>
            <li>And Amazon&#x27;s price can&#x27;t be beat, I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s still available for my next bottle!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle too...put it on after you wash your face...</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that these drops both contain retinol and ferulic acid together.  </li>
            <li>Overall my skin is in good condition and I have taken it for granted, doing minimal things to keep it up with cleansing and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Ferulic Acid product for almost a month and have noticed significant changes in my skin.</li>
            <li>I originally got it in the alpha beta peel sample kit, and I actually  ignored it.</li>
            <li>I first got this product as a sample size and tried it on my face and was completely freaked out as to how my skin responded.</li>
            <li>I still have more than half the bottle to go</li>
            <li>I wish I’d gotten the bigger bottle because it does seem to go quickly.</li>
            <li>I have used Dr Dennis Gross over the last 2 months and love it.  </li>
            <li>In three weeks not only are the spots about 50% improved, but seriously my whole face is brighter and dare I say somewhat luminous (in the right lighting--lighting is EVERYTHING, ha!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the price is quite high, but I have tried Philosophy, Viviers, Obagi and lots others C serum.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it if you use it consistently...took about a week to notice results.</li>
            <li>First, I have large pores around my nose and second</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please don&#x27;t be daunted by the price tag - it is worth every red cent.</li>
            <li>Love this product and use it everyday after applying the alpha beta peel.</li>
            <li>My skin has been problematic for so long that its become immune to pretty much all of it.</li>
            <li>After the first 30 day I incorporated in the Dennis Gross Alpha Beta peel pads and still saw no change.</li>
            <li>interested in my routine, I use argan soap (generic, direct from Morocco.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and a half now, but haven&#x27;t seen any results to get excited about.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling soft and break out free-&lt;br /&gt;Pricey</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 31 years old and bought this product for two reasons.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft &amp; I have received compliments on the brightness of my skin.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone who wants to use this for the same purpose.</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>as early as one week after nightly use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m turning 27 and its never too early to start thinking about wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>and so far that&#x27;s been working out beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>I am 40 years old and been having hormonal breakouts which cause scarring.</li>
            <li>Does go bad kind of quickly.</li>
            <li>Really helped lighten acne scars after only 2 weeks, pores are smaller and</li>
            <li>I really like using this with the Dr. Dennis Gross extra strength alpha beta peel.  </li>
            <li>The good news is that even though the product is expensive, it will last you quite a while.</li>
            <li>First received this in a sample with other products--and I&#x27;ve been hooked since.  </li>
            <li>My skin is much smoother, less inflamed, and the acne I have is healing without new nodules forming.</li>
            <li>The serum helps get my skin back to normal in a short time by brightening, reducing tautness and reducing flake formation.</li>
            <li>This is my third time ordering this product &amp; my skin showed noticeable difference the first time around (faded dark spots from sun damage).</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say the long term effects of this product, but so far I&#x27;m in love.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a relatively cheapie argan soap) and a gentle scrubbie to wash, Dr. Gross Extra Strength Alpha Beta peel (half pads again), this Brightening serum on a half pad, pure argan oil or argan cream (switch it up),</li>

            <li> Something important to note is that this serum will not work at all if you haven&#x27;t exfoliated recently.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by a sales person who is attached to Sephora in NYC...and was very sceptical to purchase as nothing I have used over the years has lightened the brown spots on my face...</li>
            <li> And Amazon&#x27;s price can&#x27;t be beat, I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s still available for my next bottle!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle too...put it on after you wash your face...</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that these drops both contain retinol and ferulic acid together.  </li>
            <li> Overall my skin is in good condition and I have taken it for granted, doing minimal things to keep it up with cleansing and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Ferulic Acid product for almost a month and have noticed significant changes in my skin.</li>
            <li> I originally got it in the alpha beta peel sample kit, and I actually  ignored it.</li>
            <li> I first got this product as a sample size and tried it on my face and was completely freaked out as to how my skin responded.</li>
            <li> I still have more than half the bottle to go</li>
            <li> I wish I’d gotten the bigger bottle because it does seem to go quickly.</li>
            <li> I have used Dr Dennis Gross over the last 2 months and love it.  </li>
            <li> In three weeks not only are the spots about 50% improved, but seriously my whole face is brighter and dare I say somewhat luminous (in the right lighting--lighting is EVERYTHING, ha!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the price is quite high, but I have tried Philosophy, Viviers, Obagi and lots others C serum.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it if you use it consistently...took about a week to notice results.</li>
            <li> First, I have large pores around my nose and second</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please don&#x27;t be daunted by the price tag - it is worth every red cent.</li>
            <li> Love this product and use it everyday after applying the alpha beta peel.</li>
            <li> My skin has been problematic for so long that its become immune to pretty much all of it.</li>
            <li> After the first 30 day I incorporated in the Dennis Gross Alpha Beta peel pads and still saw no change.</li>
            <li> interested in my routine, I use argan soap (generic, direct from Morocco.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and a half now, but haven&#x27;t seen any results to get excited about.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling soft and break out free-&lt;br /&gt;Pricey</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31 years old and bought this product for two reasons.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft &amp; I have received compliments on the brightness of my skin.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone who wants to use this for the same purpose.</li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> as early as one week after nightly use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m turning 27 and its never too early to start thinking about wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> and so far that&#x27;s been working out beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> I am 40 years old and been having hormonal breakouts which cause scarring.</li>
            <li> Does go bad kind of quickly.</li>
            <li> Really helped lighten acne scars after only 2 weeks, pores are smaller and</li>
            <li> I really like using this with the Dr. Dennis Gross extra strength alpha beta peel.  </li>
            <li> The good news is that even though the product is expensive, it will last you quite a while.</li>
            <li> First received this in a sample with other products--and I&#x27;ve been hooked since.  </li>
            <li> My skin is much smoother, less inflamed, and the acne I have is healing without new nodules forming.</li>
            <li> The serum helps get my skin back to normal in a short time by brightening, reducing tautness and reducing flake formation.</li>
            <li> This is my third time ordering this product &amp; my skin showed noticeable difference the first time around (faded dark spots from sun damage).</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say the long term effects of this product, but so far I&#x27;m in love.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a relatively cheapie argan soap) and a gentle scrubbie to wash, Dr. Gross Extra Strength Alpha Beta peel (half pads again), this Brightening serum on a half pad, pure argan oil or argan cream (switch it up),</li>
            <li> This is the only product in a long time that&#x27;s given me any noticeable results.</li>
            <li> Consequently, you should not rely on this product alone (or any other similar product) to help with hyperpigmentation or acne scars</li>
            <li> I can see the dark patches fading daily.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time without any negative reactions to my skin which is sensitive to everything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> The actual bottle was missing.</li>
            <li> and I immediately stopped using and was bummed about the money I had spent.</li>
            <li> drops on the lower arms, and I swear it&#x27;s totally helping firm up that skin.</li>
            <li> I am not certain if I would buy it again...</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for about a month and only see a very slight improvement.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do any improvement as other reviews and expected.</li>
            <li> It also has the slightest of smells, but it shouldn&#x27;t be offensive to even persons with a sharp sense of smell.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try to use it on other areas since I had bought it and couldn&#x27;t return.</li>
            <li> I found this did not absorb into my skin as well as some of the other serums I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Ive heard other people mention that the culprit is ferulic acid.</li>
            <li> After dealing with moderate acne (and sensitivity, and blackheads, grr) my whole life (40+ now), I have some moderate dark spots that bother me still.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve seen improvement on how it has lightened some dark spot on my face from pimples and sun damage.</li>
            <li> , I have a dark spot from a blemish that I was hoping to fade.</li>
            <li> At least it is the last ingredient but change to a safer preservative and five star all the way!</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my dark spots have faded.</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve seen bigger pores and a texture to my skin</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or cause breakouts, and my brown spots are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> At 57 the skin on my upper arms is starting to head south and do this weird grandma-wrinkly-hanging thing that is pushing me into longer sleeves.</li>
            <li> have been using it for 2 weeks now and have noticed a healthier skin, less blemishes, and diminishing brown spots.</li>
            <li> this serum is at first sticky and smells like cold medicine...</li>
            <li> My disappointment however, is that the one dark spot that I am trying to get rid of is still very visible.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, I put the serum on the first day, and in less than 24 hours my inflammation decreased by at least half, and has continued to decrease.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money, it is a scam.</li>
            <li> Totally waste of money.</li>
            <li> Go down fighting!!</li>
            <li> Also, the small lines in my forehead appear to be softening.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31 and still breakout, have chronically inflamed skin, and a lot of small acne scars.</li>
            <li> I have melasma, which was made worse by an ill-advised chemical peel, and I&#x27;ve tried a ton of products and spent a small fortune on laser treatments to try to get rid of those brown spots.  </li>
            <li> and i mean you have to use it, not just a few times.  </li>
            <li> In the mean time my dermatologist recommended something prescription strength that I&#x27;m now trying</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 2 weeks now and my skin&#x27;s breakout diminished this time around (you know what I mean ladies) and the scarring is disappearing.</li>
            <li> I only gave it a 4 star because it&#x27;s so darn expensive!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s less expensive.</li>
            <li> Not a great way to start the day</li>
            <li> I chalked the experience up to a failed attempt with high-end products</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any benefit from using it unfortunately - will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> The combination of products is expensive but its a very small price to pay for confidence!!</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> but it does tingle bad.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to give a bad review.  </li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I got this product four days ago and I already see a difference. My skin is much smoother, less inflamed, and the acne I have is healing without new nodules forming. Seriously, I put the serum on the first day, and in less than 24 hours my inflammation decreased by at least half, and has continued to decrease. Also, the small lines in my forehead appear to be softening. It&#x27;s only been four days so I can&#x27;t say the long term effects of this product, but so far I&#x27;m in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing works for me anymore. I&#x27;m 31 and still breakout, have chronically inflamed skin, and a lot of small acne scars. I&#x27;ve run the gamut of skincare for over a decade while trying to stop breakouts and soften the scarring... I&#x27;ve used Avon peels and glycolic acid resurfacing serum, 30% salicylic and glycolic acid peels, a whole slew of alpha hydroxy products, prescription retinoids, over the counter acne medication, tea tree oil, and the list goes on. My skin has been problematic for so long that its become immune to pretty much all of it. This is the only product in a long time that&#x27;s given me any noticeable results. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I must say this is the first serum that I use and really like very much. I did not put 5 stars because I think it is not yet perfection and the price is quite high, but I have tried Philosophy, Viviers, Obagi and lots others C serum. This one is by far the best I have used. It leaves the skin bright, smooth. I literally glow. It is not greasy or make you look like an orange face. I am very happy about it. I might surely reorder again but I do hesitate cause of the price and also I discovered with a lemon juice I can almost have the same result but it does tingle bad. So to sum up my point: goes on smoothly, glowy skin and no greasy effect at all. So give it a try, I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Really helped lighten acne scars after only 2 weeks, pores are smaller and no breakouts since!</li>
            <li> I use this all the time without any negative reactions to my skin which is sensitive to everything.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling soft and break out free-&lt;br /&gt;Pricey but I think good Retinol is worth the splurge</li>
            <li> I have been using the Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Ferulic Acid product for almost a month and have noticed significant changes in my skin.</li>
            <li> I noticed no change in my skin tone after using for several weeks.  It did not even out my skin/dark spots as advertised.  In the mean time my dermatologist recommended something prescription strength that I&#x27;m now trying and it&#x27;s less expensive.</li>
            <li> Love this product,have used it before and it works.</li>
            <li> Use this product in the morning under moisturizer, as per their consultant at Nordstroms.  It appears to be smoothing out y skin and refreshing the cells</li>
            <li> Works well; I can tell a difference after about a week of use. I wish I’d gotten the bigger bottle because it does seem to go quickly.</li>
            <li> I really like using this with the Dr. Dennis Gross extra strength alpha beta peel.  Within days of starting the combo, I could see a difference and so could others.  In fact, I recently stopped it for about 2 months and the change in my appearance was noticeable.  Glad to be using it again!</li>
            <li> great stuff, have used it before</li>
            <li> excellent clarifying product!</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for about a month and only see a very slight improvement. I plan to finish this bottle and maybe one more bottle before I make a final determination if I like the product or not.</li>
            <li> this is a good product, and these do actually work if used...and i mean you have to use it, not just a few times.  For my daily use&lt;br /&gt;now i use Prolastil as it seems to put that youthful foundation to work.  This product i use for touch-up.  If you work on keeping your&lt;br /&gt;skin looking good, it will.  most people expect results in a day, and those products just dont really work.  These products do, if you&lt;br /&gt;are the type willing to commit.</li>
            <li> I use this product along with the daily alpha-beta peel.  They work well together.  This solution really does brighten up your skin and gives it a wonderful feel.  I must be honest though - I&#x27;ve always had good skin and never had a problem with acne.  So, if you have problem skin, I&#x27;m not sure if this product is good for you.  If you want something that just really brightens your skin and gives you a younger healthy look - this is definitly for you!</li>
            <li> Really love this stuff! I use it with the alpha beta peels (extra strength) as needed with my hormonal breakouts. My skin feels different immediately and looks different within a day. This will always been in my regimen. I&#x27;m only 25 and I figured now is the time to start using anti-aging products! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a long time and it is great.  It is cheaper on here than in Sephora</li>
            <li> This is a fine skin product and I can see a definite lift to my skin. Will be comparing it to anther two products before&lt;br /&gt;the jury comes in.</li>
            <li> I meant to order the Vitamin D oil and got this instead (my fault)  So I thought I&#x27;d keep it and give it a try.  Didnt&#x27; do anything.  Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Very nice product.  Smoothes and evens out the skin tone.  I would definitely purchase this product again.  Gives skin a nice radiance.</li>
            <li> Initially, I was excited to try a brightening serum and after reading positive results on their website, I decided to give it a try. Well, after two weeks, I didn&#x27;t see, feel, or notice any difference on my face. I chalked the experience up to a failed attempt with high-end products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks and I&#x27;ve seen improvement on how it has lightened some dark spot on my face from pimples and sun damage. I like it very much and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do any improvement as other reviews and expected. And one bottle can only last than 30 days. If you apply day and night. Over price to me.</li>
            <li> This prodcut makes your face looks sooo good. I like how easy it is to use.  I&#x27;ll use this product the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;Judy</li>
            <li> The overall improvement in my skin is improving.  My disappointment however, is that the one dark spot that I am trying to get rid of is still very visible.  In all fairness though it is getting lighter.  I still have more than half the bottle to go and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll have better results than today.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31 years old and bought this product for two reasons. First, I have large pores around my nose and second, I have a dark spot from a blemish that I was hoping to fade. I used the ENTIRE bottle of this and saw no difference at all. After the first 30 day I incorporated in the Dennis Gross Alpha Beta peel pads and still saw no change. My &#x27;before&#x27; and &#x27;after&#x27; pictures are just about identical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money. I will not repurchase and do not recommend.</li>
            <li> I used this product 2x a day for 4 weeks. I did not lessen the darkness of brown spots. Dont waste your money, it is a scam.</li>
            <li> I use this every morning after washing my face and before applying a good moisturizer. Every night I use the Dr. Dennis two-step face wipes and then apply the solution. Yes it&#x27;s pricey but I probably spent more money on cheaper and subpar products that never worked. My skin looked noticeably better. I also got my mom and older sister hooked! Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I have tried other high quality serums and this is the best. My skin is so soft &amp; I have received compliments on the brightness of my skin. My pores are smaller which is one of the concerns I had. Dr Gross&#x27;s products are great &amp; really work you will get results with this product.</li>
            <li> I have used Dr Dennis Gross over the last 2 months and love it.  This product has eliminated most of my brown spots on my face.  It did take 1-2 weeks to see the difference.  I would recommend to anyone who wants to use this for the same purpose.</li>
            <li> This stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t be daunted by the price tag - it is worth every red cent. It makes your skin look photo ready, makeup optional, afterglow fabulous. I originally got it in the alpha beta peel sample kit, and I actually  ignored it. This elixir was sitting on my bedside table, unloved, for a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it one morning when I ran out of my moisturizer, and...wow. So, so nice. I didn&#x27;t have any issues with dryness (even though I always layer with an additional moisturizer), and doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out. It also has the slightest of smells, but it shouldn&#x27;t be offensive to even persons with a sharp sense of smell.</li>
            <li> Was using the extra strength alpha beta peels and added this in;  this made an amazing product twice as effective in treating acne, marks and giving an all over glow.  1 star off for the inclusion of phenoxyethanol as a preservative.  At least it is the last ingredient but change to a safer preservative and five star all the way!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about three weeks and my skin is smoother, so I think it&#x27;s working. I added in the dr. gross beta peel at night too.</li>
            <li> After dealing with moderate acne (and sensitivity, and blackheads, grr) my whole life (40+ now), I have some moderate dark spots that bother me still. I thought I&#x27;d have to save up for a Beverly Hills laser treatment series to improve them, but in the meantime I still look for &amp;#34;hope in a bottle&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this in conjunction with the Extra Strength Alpha Beta peel, 2x/day, and I am quite impressed and happy with the results. In three weeks not only are the spots about 50% improved, but seriously my whole face is brighter and dare I say somewhat luminous (in the right lighting--lighting is EVERYTHING, ha!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All my life I&#x27;ve considered high-end foundation a daily necessity to look my best, and I have put my beloved Chanel away for now, I don&#x27;t think it improves on my complection after using this. Which could help with the expense, yikes! However, I&#x27;d rather spend $ improving myself to not depend on pricey makeup, you know? And even though this is a 1-oz bottle, I use it fairly generously (10-ish drops on a half-pad), and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll last me several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If interested in my routine, I use argan soap (generic, direct from Morocco. Dunno the brand, can&#x27;t read the packaging. But it&#x27;s a relatively cheapie argan soap) and a gentle scrubbie to wash, Dr. Gross Extra Strength Alpha Beta peel (half pads again), this Brightening serum on a half pad, pure argan oil or argan cream (switch it up), and in the morning Neutrogena 50 SPF/moisturizer. I&#x27;ve been real happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I originally received a free trial size of this product with a purchase from another site and was so pleased with the results I was seeing that I purchased a full size bottle.  I have melasma, which was made worse by an ill-advised chemical peel, and I&#x27;ve tried a ton of products and spent a small fortune on laser treatments to try to get rid of those brown spots.  I love that I can get ferulic acid and retinol in the same product!  This product doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or cause breakouts, and my brown spots are less noticeable.  I&#x27;m very happy to have discovered this product!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to give a bad review.  But, because I received the open bottle and couldn&#x27;t find easy way to exchange or return it, I have to throw it away.  I&#x27;ll never buy it from amazon again.</li>
            <li> The actual bottle was missing. The only thing I received was the dropper and cotton pads. I returned it immediately.</li>
            <li> The Ferulic Acid and Retinol Brightening solution is effective in improving the complexion as well as the the overall  tone of skin. I saw results as early as one week after nightly use. I also find the serum particularly effective after my biweekly at home chemical peel (lunch/ superficial light peels like salicylic acid or lactic acid). The serum helps get my skin back to normal in a short time by brightening, reducing tautness and reducing flake formation. Something important to note is that this serum will not work at all if you haven&#x27;t exfoliated recently. Without exfoliation or some kind of peel, you will get no results because the serum won&#x27;t be able to penetrate the most exterior layers [ -1star]. It simply will not work. Consequently, you should not rely on this product alone (or any other similar product) to help with hyperpigmentation or acne scars - you need a peel for that ladies. While I am happy with this product I switched to the ole henriksen anti-aging (3 wonders skin collection - I&#x27;ve observed similar or better results). I&#x27;m turning 27 and its never too early to start thinking about wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck! :)</li>
            <li> I first got this product as a sample size and tried it on my face and was completely freaked out as to how my skin responded. The first morning I looked so haggard, with ALL my wrinkles seeming deeper and my whole face darker and O.L.D! Not a great way to start the day and I immediately stopped using and was bummed about the money I had spent. So then- a week or so later- I thought I&#x27;d try to use it on other areas since I had bought it and couldn&#x27;t return. At 57 the skin on my upper arms is starting to head south and do this weird grandma-wrinkly-hanging thing that is pushing me into longer sleeves. I started using this on my upper arms, 3 drops each and a couple drops on the lower arms, and I swear it&#x27;s totally helping firm up that skin. I bought another sample size just to see and have now, thru Amazon (cheapest I&#x27;ve found over sephora and ebay) purchased the full bottle size and it&#x27;s looking like I won&#x27;t be without it.&lt;br /&gt;I may try this on my face in the future but I&#x27;ve just started using Dr Brandt resurfacing, the night and morning set and so far that&#x27;s been working out beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck girls! Go down fighting!!</li>
            <li> Good product. Does go bad kind of quickly.</li>
            <li> I found this did not absorb into my skin as well as some of the other serums I&#x27;ve tried.  I didn&#x27;t see any benefit from using it unfortunately - will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by a sales person who is attached to Sephora in NYC...and was very sceptical to purchase as nothing I have used over the years has lightened the brown spots on my face...so I took a chance and purchased this item...and what fantastic results!!! This is my second bottle....that says it all...Great Product!</li>
            <li> Not a bad product but I thought it would work better.  It&#x27;s not bad.  I am not certain if I would buy it again...</li>
            <li> Love this product! It&#x27;s a great addition to my decleor products and keeps your skin feeling &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my dark spots have faded. It took a couple of months to actually see the results, but it does work.</li>
            <li> This is great when paired with the peel! I have sensitive/problematic skin but when I started using the peel with the brightening solution, I am very happy to say my skin looks great!! The combination of products is expensive but its a very small price to pay for confidence!!</li>
            <li> Works at lightening and resurfacing as advertised.</li>
            <li> Great price. At sephora this is $88. Love this product and use it everyday after applying the alpha beta peel. Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this product and liked it enough to buy it. Overall my skin is in good condition and I have taken it for granted, doing minimal things to keep it up with cleansing and moisturizing.  Lately I&#x27;ve seen bigger pores and a texture to my skin I didn&#x27;t like.  Even after carefully cleaning my face, this product will stlll remove more dirt which is impressive.  It has helped diminish pore size on my nose and overall improved the clarity of my skin making it look clean and fresh.  They do not include enough micro pads with the product but you can buy extras at the drug store - not as good as what&#x27;s in the box but they work fine.  I was hoping it would lighten age spots on my face but it has not done anything to improve that.  I have sensitive skin and have to be careful what I use as some products have made my face looked burned.  This product is gentle and overall I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> This is the only retinol I have used that doesn&#x27;t break my face out.  I am very pleased with this product since a I noticed a lightening of the age spots on my face.  The price on Amazon can&#x27;t be beat!!!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! This is my third time ordering this product &amp; my skin showed noticeable difference the first time around (faded dark spots from sun damage). Highly recommend it if you use it consistently...took about a week to notice results.</li>
            <li> Fabulous. I was receiving compliments on my skin after one use. I use it about 3 times a week at night because it can be drying, but not uncomfortably. I&#x27;m almost 30 and I was looking for something to improve texture and overall radiance and honestly my skin is the best it ever looked; clear and healthy. And Amazon&#x27;s price can&#x27;t be beat, I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s still available for my next bottle!</li>
            <li> Great product, my skin is glowing.  First received this in a sample with other products--and I&#x27;ve been hooked since.  It&#x27;s gentle too...put it on after you wash your face...follow with any serums and a moisturizer.  If using in the morning, follow with a really good sunscreen...</li>
            <li> Been using this for 6 weeks+ and see a big difference in pres size.</li>
            <li> I love the microfiber pads used for application. I use it daily after the alpha-beta pads. I can see the dark patches fading daily.</li>
            <li> I have used Dr. Gross&#x27; Alpha Beta Daily Facial peels for years, but topping it off with the Ferulic Acid and Retinol Brightening Solution, I see and feel the difference..BIG TIME! I am 40 years old and been having hormonal breakouts which cause scarring. I have been using this product for over 2 weeks now and my skin&#x27;s breakout diminished this time around (you know what I mean ladies) and the scarring is disappearing. My skin has been renewed!! LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and a half now, but haven&#x27;t seen any results to get excited about. The good news is that even though the product is expensive, it will last you quite a while.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any results what so ever. I have been using it for almost a month and nothing. I&#x27;m still debating if I want to continue using or just through it away..Totally waste of money.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that these drops both contain retinol and ferulic acid together.  Both ingredients are anti-aging and it definitely shows in the quality and texture of my skin.  I only gave it a 4 star because it&#x27;s so darn expensive!</li>
            <li> have been using it for 2 weeks now and have noticed a healthier skin, less blemishes, and diminishing brown spots. I will continue to purchase and will recommend to friends and family.</li>
            <li> When I incorporated this into my skin care regimen It caused me to break out all along my jaw line....this serum is at first sticky and smells like cold medicine...Dimetapp comes to mind...the price is great on Amazon and If it was not causing me to break out I wouldve kept it. Im guessing it might be the ferulic acid since after trying this Ive heard other people mention that the culprit is ferulic acid. Im currently back on my Obagi &amp; Glytone products and couldnt be happier.</li>
