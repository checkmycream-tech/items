            <li>So, love this gel !</li>
            <li>and now I&#x27;m so much better!</li>
            <li>I am so glad we found this!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it was awesome!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s magic!</li>
            <li>I brought the noble cream around 6 mos ago and it did an amazing job on my face.  </li>
            <li>So, I took a gamble and ordered the Noble Formula Cream.</li>
            <li>I use both the Noble Formula 2% Pyrithione Zinc Bar Soap and this cream simultaneously.  </li>
            <li>Hydrocortisone cream seems to be an effective treatment of the symptoms, but the Noble Cream seems to have taken care of the cause of the problem.</li>
            <li>I also tried the Noble soap, but it stung my eyes.</li>
            <li>The absolute best cream out there.</li>
            <li>It smells kind of rancid.</li>
            <li>This is my review for the Noble Formula HC Cream w/ Hydrocortisone 1% product, but I wanted to share my experiences here as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s how I found noble formula.</li>
            <li>had never even heard of this product, but after reading through reviews I decided to take a chance and try the Noble</li>
            <li>My husband found this Noble Formula Cream online.</li>
            <li>I bought noble formula and applied it to my face and it stopped flaking and the redness was gone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Noble Formula for over a month</li>
            <li>Noble Formula Cream with Pyrithione Zinc did the trick.</li>
            <li>&quot; the kind of dermatitis he has</li>
            <li>Thank you noble</li>
            <li>It may not smell so sweet but is very effective and soothing to my skin.</li>
            <li>The Noble Formula cream is working as well or better than the prescription med.  </li>
            <li>We love Noble Formula Cream.</li>
            <li>Truly in this day where medication is needed and those who cannot afford, someone has a true good heart.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very light cream, so you don&#x27;t need a lot to cover the area in question.  </li>
            <li>Even though this cream is unscented, in my opinion, it has a fresh, pleasant sent.</li>
            <li>Though to be honest, I prefer that to a strong &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>so the best you can do is to hide it and keep any itching at bay, and this cream is most definitely a goldmine for me.</li>
            <li>So glad I found this and wish I had sooner</li>
            <li>So it isn&#x27;t really a cure in my case, but it&#x27;s great at controlling the symptoms!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It relieved the itching, and within days I was able to put foundation on my face without my skin peeling off.  </li>
            <li>Much better than the ketoconazole I had been prescribed).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about 90% better after using this product for two weeks..</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been on many dates since.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more of a paste.</li>
            <li>Have been using a combination of apple cider vinegar and Clobestasol Propionate and that has done much better than this cream.</li>
            <li>He looked noticeably better after one day, in three days it was gone.</li>
            <li>, I will update soon with more conclusive results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This might seem a bit over the top</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was kind of pricey ($29.99+ free s&amp;h), but I used my Amazon points to purchase.</li>
            <li>Am glad I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad we did.</li>
            <li>OK, ewwwww - I have sebhorreic dermatitis (the grown-up version of cradle cap?)</li>
            <li>After reading all the ratings, I thought this product would work better.  </li>
            <li>anyway we have tried many product on it</li>
            <li>Once a week use of  a pyrithione shampoo worked okay, but I was looking for something better.  </li>
            <li>My latest attempt was a tar-based psoriasin or something.</li>
            <li>VAseline works better.</li>
            <li>So like most eczema sufferers I do tons of research and came across this product and bought it without hesitation because of all the fantastic reviews!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use anything with oil in it, as you&#x27;re adding oil on top of the oils your face produces from having seb derm.</li>
            <li>I recommend a nightly application before bed to allow the medication to work its magic overnight.</li>
            <li>We are glad that this was recommended by a dermatologist.</li>
            <li>Thank you Nobel Fornula! :)</li>
            <li>Best solution for getting rid of red, scaly, itchy skin.</li>
            <li>it take away the redness and flaking and quite frankly I use it every day now to be on the safe side...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li>it was more of a light burn sensation.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s working great.</li>
            <li>Honestly even without the points it is totally worth</li>
            <li>I know this sounds infommercial-ish, but within a day or two after the first use my skin looked better than it&#x27;s looked in a decade or more.</li>
            <li>Unless you&#x27;re allergic like me, it would probably be fine.</li>
            <li>but I have noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I was fortunate to discover a trigger and a cure</li>
            <li>Great ingredients and totally ROCKS!</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>Nothing is really 100% effective</li>
            <li>This lotion is the best product I have found for my problem, clearing up the symptoms in a few days.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>Using in conjunction with the soap and so far so good</li>
            <li>It really just feels like a nice, rich moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This cream smells quite good, and the results seem to be pretty much equivalent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone a week without using it once, and my skin still looked great, but I don&#x27;t trust it&#x27;ll stay that away for too long</li>
            <li>I was so excited</li>
            <li>Sulfur soap helps keep my face clean and that&#x27;s all it can do.</li>
            <li>I have had seb derm for 20 plus years and this product helping right away!</li>
            <li>If you stay cool before</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find it that bothersome, but I&#x27;m sure some would find it very</li>
            <li>It got to the point I&#x27;d only go out if I was having a good (skin) day.</li>
            <li>I only write reviews for a product that is truly exceptional and this Nobel Formula Cream is it.  </li>
            <li>I have a mild case of seborrheic dermatitis, however it&#x27;s been bugging me for all my life.</li>
            <li>I finally decided to give this a shot since it has a lot of 5 stars, and man am I glad I did!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s such an easy (and cheap!) solution.</li>
            <li>Helps calm, moisturize, reduce redness and scaling caused by dermatitis.  </li>
            <li>I found the product to be helpful and worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t thing it is worth.</li>
            <li>I am a 50 year old female who has always had great skin.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this cream at the same time I bought Noble Formula Zinc Soap.  </li>
            <li>i know some people wrote here that it didn&#x27;t work for them, but it worked for him and definitely worth a try</li>
            <li>it is worth it</li>
            <li>I am currently waiting for my Noble Formula bar soap to arrive to see how it works with the cream.</li>
            <li>So I decided to try some more natural and over the counter remedies and ditch the prescription.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m just trying to find the right intervals to use the cream.</li>
            <li>I did feel immediate results however it took a full 4 weeks until all my skin was soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This is the first review I have ever made on Amazon because I really feel this product helped me a LOT!!</li>
            <li>Only thing that&#x27;s not too good is the smell, it smells very &#x27;chemical&#x27;, but I don&#x27;t mind that too much.</li>
            <li>After a long time of product trial and error for my scaly scalp seborrheic dermatitis, I purchased Noble Formula Cream from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so maybe a few more weeks the itchiness will be better.  </li>
            <li>so maybe a few more weeks the itchiness will be better.  </li>
            <li>It is also very gentle on the skin, doesn&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
            <li>Found this lotion and have been using it once daily for more than 3 months and have seen a real improvement (a first!</li>
            <li>It stings a lot going on, but then the next day, the lesion is better.  </li>
            <li>But the results don&#x27;t lie, and a year or more later, my seb derm is fully under control.</li>
            <li>First twice a day.</li>
            <li>it seemed to not help the first couple of days</li>
            <li>The redness goes away within hours and feels smooth and soft on her skin.</li>
            <li>For the first time in years he no longer has his skin problem.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the FIRST application, my flakey/scaly patches have not come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have dealt with seborrheic dermatitis for a while, and am glad to have FINALLY found relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and my face is in better shape than the last 20 years.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it first before trying a prescription cream.</li>
            <li>This actually made him itch more</li>
            <li>The soap may be effective on other parts of the body though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that, it seems to be working better than anything I&#x27;ve tried, though it&#x27;s hard to be sure after just once week.</li>
            <li>I used to have flaking and itching around my nose and eyebrows, and the sides of my nose were perpetually red from the corticosteroids, but I haven&#x27;t used a drop of steroid since I started with Noble Formula, and my skin has more or less recovered.</li>
            <li>This time it wasn&#x27;t only bright red, her skin stared to flake.</li>
            <li>I first gently with my fingernail</li>
            <li>Nothing worked for long, even the most emollient of creams.  </li>
            <li>I have tried  almost all medications in existence, and stopped most of them because of the long term side effects.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used dandruff shampoo, scalpicin, cortisone creams (which was the most succesful), but nothing ever made it go away for a long time.  </li>
            <li>My skin actually looks very good and soft, it actually looks a lot younger.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Around the three week area, morning applications have very little pain if any, redness is barely visible, scales are a lot better, practically 90 percent better.  </li>
            <li>get all the flakes I can off the area without digging much, get rid of the looser ones.</li>
            <li>I tried to find the much lauded ZNP bar.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve yet to find any real downsides to the product,</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband and it is really helping the rash he gets around his waist, nothing we have gotten before has worked, even things from the doctor.</li>
            <li>Stopped the itching fast.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>So I really recommend this</li>
            <li>longer story is that I had a lengthy correspondence with Lorelei from Ontos, and she was very helpful in providing replacement jars.</li>
            <li>I used a gentle cleanser (Walmart brand Cetphil) and then used Nobel Cream for 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Now all I use is the gentle cleanser</li>
            <li>I had a very severe case of Seborrheic Dermatitis...</li>
            <li>I really and truly have no complaints.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I have soo much product remaining, so I plan on using it once a week after washing(as a</li>
            <li>really hope this keeps up.</li>
            <li>comfortable-- forgets-- and its back again.  </li>
            <li>The cream is not greasy or sticky at all and is very soothing.</li>
            <li>face cleared and it has stayed clean for the last month or so.</li>
            <li>To make a long story short, i use this noble cream in combination with sulfur soap and my seb derm is under control now.</li>
            <li>After several years of my husband having dry patches of skin on his face he started using Noble Cream.</li>
            <li>wash with noble bar during showers and I usually apply this cream twice a day (after shower and before sleep)</li>
            <li>in mind, I also have been exfoliating regularly and using a mild soap as was also suggested by the forums I visted.</li>
            <li>I have had moderate to severe seborrhea most of my life, and have struggled with various lotions to rid the redness and flaking.</li>
            <li>Her face is back to normal again, as soft and smooth as a little girl&#x27;s face should be, but we will be ordering more just to have on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have flaking or associated redness, I highly recommend you give this a try.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this purchase for someone with any skin issue.</li>
            <li>Many of the little bumps that have plagued me for years (never became pimples just looked like clogged pores or something but TONS)</li>
            <li>This cream completely eliminated the scaling around my nose and face!!</li>
            <li>Could find only 1 positive review that was positive on SLS and that warned against using anything with TEA in it.  </li>
            <li>and after you apply the cream, everything is normal.</li>
            <li>Pretty much cured my seborrheic dermatitis  (facial dandruff) which I didn&#x27;t even know was a thing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve concluded that the smell I was smelling is normal for this product.</li>
            <li>Well let me simply say that it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>We saw great results after about two days with this and it stung a little, but much less than that steroid treatment did.</li>
            <li>I have a very mild case of perioral dermatitis that only developed in the last year after having zero skin problems my whole life.</li>
            <li>, I had red dry patches of skin on my face mostly on my forehead.</li>
            <li>This cream is totally worth the hype and the money, especially if you have mild skin problems and live in a dry climate like I do.</li>
            <li>In the 3 days since I received it my bumps have gone down considerably and most are gone completely.  </li>
            <li>However, if I exercise in the morning before using it or find myself outside getting hot after I&#x27;ve put it on, my face sweats profusely in the areas where I&#x27;ve applied the cream.</li>
            <li>the ONLY downside for me is that they don&#x27;t ship this to my country;)</li>
            <li>I suspect MANY active people do, especially adults with acne, and have no idea!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend using anything on your face other than sulfur soap to clean it.</li>
            <li>It certainly helps calm down the flaking and the redness.</li>
            <li>My 19 year old developed seb dermatitis on the sides of his nose which wasn&#x27;t going away with normal skin care.</li>
            <li>Some didn&#x27;t work at all, and many only made a slight difference.</li>
            <li>Already had dry peeling skin, so what&#x27;s to lose right?  </li>
            <li>I tried things that made it WAY worse (oils, washing with Himalayan salt) and one day read a post about pyrithione zinc being amazing for seb derm.</li>
            <li>Takes awhile to get the hang of it, but I find if I clear up the scales myself before the cream that the result is no scales after the cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had Dermatitis on my face for 30 years and have always had red blotchy scaling skin that was very embarrassing.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for selling this cream at such a reasonable cost.  </li>
            <li>My skin may be too sensitive for this product.</li>
            <li>Still have a complete jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and am prone to acne.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised that this did not cause my skin to break out.</li>
            <li>and I learned what it was, and that I was far from alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was a bit surprised.</li>
            <li>Not being a chemist, I am not qualified to evaluate the merits of the reviews, but as the old saying goes &amp;#34;where</li>
            <li>I ordered this product for my 8 year old daughter who started getting sebborhic dermatitis around her nose and eyelids.</li>
            <li>If you have really sensitive skin watch out with this.</li>
            <li>The whole time we systematically treated it with different medications and home remedies.</li>
            <li>My daughter has never needed the second jar we purchased, but I really don&#x27;t regret buying it just in case.</li>
            <li>I am 75 years old and had seborrhea all my life.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>but it is too early to say..</li>
            <li>One application of this cream about 10 days ago has completely stopped the scale.  </li>
            <li>Some stuff can keep seb derm at bay but not cure it completely.</li>
            <li>I suffer from minor pityrosporum folliculitis and didn&#x27;t want to spend money seeing a dermatologist without trying this product out first.</li>
            <li>I bought this cream, and within FOUR DAYS of use (about 2-3 applications per day), the problem spots were completely gone.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been washing my face religiously with a natural, gentle exfoliating cleanser and a Clarisonic facial brush, and I&#x27;m already noticing really promising results.</li>
            <li>I use daily when I get out of the shower and my face was immediately better after a few days and now it&#x27;s like I never had it.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I will write review again later after few more weeks.....</li>
            <li>I was excited when I got this cream, but in a few days I had a rash which I had to start treating with cortisone cream.  </li>
            <li>My husband has breakouts on his scalp and face--this formula (used in unions, soap and cream) has done more than any other product offered by doctors from one coast to the other.  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve used it for a month or two now and it not only completely reversed one of the worse bright red flair ups</li>
            <li>I finally found that using salicylic acid (in the form of Neutrogena Acne Stress Control 3-in-1 Hydrating Acne Treatment) prior to applying the cream and using a double-dose of the Noble cream (applied, rubbed in, waited a few minutes and applied again) helped get rid of the last of it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t have spent so much $ on otc and rx stuff claiming it works for SD!</li>
            <li>I use it with my normal daily moisturizer</li>
            <li>Really the only cream I&#x27;ve found that works for facial outbreaks brought on by oil from your hair</li>
            <li>first I was applying the cream once a day, but I&#x27;ve now scaled it back to once every 2 or 3 days, and may cut back even further.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a major improvement in my seborrheic dermatitis.</li>
            <li>and there have been no other issues/impacts it has had on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth the extra ten dollars over the next lower priced similar item.</li>
            <li>It had finally cleared up, and then I developed tinea versicolor on my arms.  </li>
            <li>I had a spot on my chest that had some issues, especially when working out a lot, and this completely cured/controls it.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews of the other one (non-steroid) and became very optimistic.</li>
            <li>at first he used it every day, then gradually went down to 2-3 times a week, and now he&#x27;s using it only about once a week, and it still does the job!</li>
            <li>I tried everything OTC and Rx and had been mis-diagnosed by numerous docs &amp; dermatologists as having regular or hormonal acne, when it was actually being caused by sweat (I had told them I was a personal trainer and athlete and also live in a humid state).</li>
            <li>There has been a week where I haven&#x27;t had to apply it at all, but generally I&#x27;d say a couple times a week when I see it&#x27;s coming back.</li>
            <li>but this shampoo felt pretty harsh on my face.</li>
            <li>Within a few HOURS of the first use I began to see a difference.  </li>
            <li>This stuff will last a LONG time, I typically dab two fingers worth onto my forehead/cheeks and rub it in</li>
            <li>Before this I had tried so many other topical lotions, raw honey, apple cider vinegar, baking soda, jojoba oil, coconut oil, castor oil, oregano oil, and so many other oils (oils made my seb derm worse) before trying this..</li>
            <li>It seems very luxurious and the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 in the review is that I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to experience the possible long term benefits.</li>

            <li> So, love this gel !</li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;m so much better!</li>
            <li> I am so glad we found this!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it was awesome!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s magic!</li>
            <li> I brought the noble cream around 6 mos ago and it did an amazing job on my face.  </li>
            <li> So, I took a gamble and ordered the Noble Formula Cream.</li>
            <li> I use both the Noble Formula 2% Pyrithione Zinc Bar Soap and this cream simultaneously.  </li>
            <li> Hydrocortisone cream seems to be an effective treatment of the symptoms, but the Noble Cream seems to have taken care of the cause of the problem.</li>
            <li> I also tried the Noble soap, but it stung my eyes.</li>
            <li> The absolute best cream out there.</li>
            <li> It smells kind of rancid.</li>
            <li> This is my review for the Noble Formula HC Cream w/ Hydrocortisone 1% product, but I wanted to share my experiences here as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s how I found noble formula.</li>
            <li> had never even heard of this product, but after reading through reviews I decided to take a chance and try the Noble</li>
            <li> My husband found this Noble Formula Cream online.</li>
            <li> I bought noble formula and applied it to my face and it stopped flaking and the redness was gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Noble Formula for over a month</li>
            <li> Noble Formula Cream with Pyrithione Zinc did the trick.</li>
            <li> &quot; the kind of dermatitis he has</li>
            <li> Thank you noble</li>
            <li> It may not smell so sweet but is very effective and soothing to my skin.</li>
            <li> The Noble Formula cream is working as well or better than the prescription med.  </li>
            <li> We love Noble Formula Cream.</li>
            <li> Truly in this day where medication is needed and those who cannot afford, someone has a true good heart.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very light cream, so you don&#x27;t need a lot to cover the area in question.  </li>
            <li> Even though this cream is unscented, in my opinion, it has a fresh, pleasant sent.</li>
            <li> Though to be honest, I prefer that to a strong &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> so the best you can do is to hide it and keep any itching at bay, and this cream is most definitely a goldmine for me.</li>
            <li> So glad I found this and wish I had sooner</li>
            <li> So it isn&#x27;t really a cure in my case, but it&#x27;s great at controlling the symptoms!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It relieved the itching, and within days I was able to put foundation on my face without my skin peeling off.  </li>
            <li> Much better than the ketoconazole I had been prescribed).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about 90% better after using this product for two weeks..</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been on many dates since.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more of a paste.</li>
            <li> Have been using a combination of apple cider vinegar and Clobestasol Propionate and that has done much better than this cream.</li>
            <li> He looked noticeably better after one day, in three days it was gone.</li>
            <li> , I will update soon with more conclusive results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This might seem a bit over the top</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was kind of pricey ($29.99+ free s&amp;h), but I used my Amazon points to purchase.</li>
            <li> Am glad I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad we did.</li>
            <li> OK, ewwwww - I have sebhorreic dermatitis (the grown-up version of cradle cap?)</li>
            <li> After reading all the ratings, I thought this product would work better.  </li>
            <li> anyway we have tried many product on it</li>
            <li> Once a week use of  a pyrithione shampoo worked okay, but I was looking for something better.  </li>
            <li> My latest attempt was a tar-based psoriasin or something.</li>
            <li> VAseline works better.</li>
            <li> So like most eczema sufferers I do tons of research and came across this product and bought it without hesitation because of all the fantastic reviews!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use anything with oil in it, as you&#x27;re adding oil on top of the oils your face produces from having seb derm.</li>
            <li> I recommend a nightly application before bed to allow the medication to work its magic overnight.</li>
            <li> We are glad that this was recommended by a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Thank you Nobel Fornula! :)</li>
            <li> Best solution for getting rid of red, scaly, itchy skin.</li>
            <li> it take away the redness and flaking and quite frankly I use it every day now to be on the safe side...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li> it was more of a light burn sensation.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s working great.</li>
            <li> Honestly even without the points it is totally worth</li>
            <li> I know this sounds infommercial-ish, but within a day or two after the first use my skin looked better than it&#x27;s looked in a decade or more.</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re allergic like me, it would probably be fine.</li>
            <li> but I have noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate to discover a trigger and a cure</li>
            <li> Great ingredients and totally ROCKS!</li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> Nothing is really 100% effective</li>
            <li> This lotion is the best product I have found for my problem, clearing up the symptoms in a few days.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> Using in conjunction with the soap and so far so good</li>
            <li> It really just feels like a nice, rich moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This cream smells quite good, and the results seem to be pretty much equivalent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone a week without using it once, and my skin still looked great, but I don&#x27;t trust it&#x27;ll stay that away for too long</li>
            <li> I was so excited</li>
            <li> Sulfur soap helps keep my face clean and that&#x27;s all it can do.</li>
            <li> I have had seb derm for 20 plus years and this product helping right away!</li>
            <li> If you stay cool before</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it that bothersome, but I&#x27;m sure some would find it very</li>
            <li> It got to the point I&#x27;d only go out if I was having a good (skin) day.</li>
            <li> I only write reviews for a product that is truly exceptional and this Nobel Formula Cream is it.  </li>
            <li> I have a mild case of seborrheic dermatitis, however it&#x27;s been bugging me for all my life.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to give this a shot since it has a lot of 5 stars, and man am I glad I did!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s such an easy (and cheap!) solution.</li>
            <li> Helps calm, moisturize, reduce redness and scaling caused by dermatitis.  </li>
            <li> I found the product to be helpful and worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t thing it is worth.</li>
            <li> I am a 50 year old female who has always had great skin.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this cream at the same time I bought Noble Formula Zinc Soap.  </li>
            <li> i know some people wrote here that it didn&#x27;t work for them, but it worked for him and definitely worth a try</li>
            <li> it is worth it</li>
            <li> I am currently waiting for my Noble Formula bar soap to arrive to see how it works with the cream.</li>
            <li> So I decided to try some more natural and over the counter remedies and ditch the prescription.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m just trying to find the right intervals to use the cream.</li>
            <li> I did feel immediate results however it took a full 4 weeks until all my skin was soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> This is the first review I have ever made on Amazon because I really feel this product helped me a LOT!!</li>
            <li> Only thing that&#x27;s not too good is the smell, it smells very &#x27;chemical&#x27;, but I don&#x27;t mind that too much.</li>
            <li> After a long time of product trial and error for my scaly scalp seborrheic dermatitis, I purchased Noble Formula Cream from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so maybe a few more weeks the itchiness will be better.  </li>
            <li> so maybe a few more weeks the itchiness will be better.  </li>
            <li> It is also very gentle on the skin, doesn&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
            <li> Found this lotion and have been using it once daily for more than 3 months and have seen a real improvement (a first!</li>
            <li> It stings a lot going on, but then the next day, the lesion is better.  </li>
            <li> But the results don&#x27;t lie, and a year or more later, my seb derm is fully under control.</li>
            <li> First twice a day.</li>
            <li> it seemed to not help the first couple of days</li>
            <li> The redness goes away within hours and feels smooth and soft on her skin.</li>
            <li> For the first time in years he no longer has his skin problem.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the FIRST application, my flakey/scaly patches have not come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have dealt with seborrheic dermatitis for a while, and am glad to have FINALLY found relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and my face is in better shape than the last 20 years.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it first before trying a prescription cream.</li>
            <li> This actually made him itch more</li>
            <li> The soap may be effective on other parts of the body though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than that, it seems to be working better than anything I&#x27;ve tried, though it&#x27;s hard to be sure after just once week.</li>
            <li> I used to have flaking and itching around my nose and eyebrows, and the sides of my nose were perpetually red from the corticosteroids, but I haven&#x27;t used a drop of steroid since I started with Noble Formula, and my skin has more or less recovered.</li>
            <li> This time it wasn&#x27;t only bright red, her skin stared to flake.</li>
            <li> I first gently with my fingernail</li>
            <li> Nothing worked for long, even the most emollient of creams.  </li>
            <li> I have tried  almost all medications in existence, and stopped most of them because of the long term side effects.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used dandruff shampoo, scalpicin, cortisone creams (which was the most succesful), but nothing ever made it go away for a long time.  </li>
            <li> My skin actually looks very good and soft, it actually looks a lot younger.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Around the three week area, morning applications have very little pain if any, redness is barely visible, scales are a lot better, practically 90 percent better.  </li>
            <li> get all the flakes I can off the area without digging much, get rid of the looser ones.</li>
            <li> I tried to find the much lauded ZNP bar.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve yet to find any real downsides to the product,</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and it is really helping the rash he gets around his waist, nothing we have gotten before has worked, even things from the doctor.</li>
            <li> Stopped the itching fast.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> So I really recommend this</li>
            <li> longer story is that I had a lengthy correspondence with Lorelei from Ontos, and she was very helpful in providing replacement jars.</li>
            <li> I used a gentle cleanser (Walmart brand Cetphil) and then used Nobel Cream for 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Now all I use is the gentle cleanser</li>
            <li> I had a very severe case of Seborrheic Dermatitis...</li>
            <li> I really and truly have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have soo much product remaining, so I plan on using it once a week after washing(as a</li>
            <li> really hope this keeps up.</li>
            <li> comfortable-- forgets-- and its back again.  </li>
            <li> The cream is not greasy or sticky at all and is very soothing.</li>
            <li> face cleared and it has stayed clean for the last month or so.</li>
            <li> To make a long story short, i use this noble cream in combination with sulfur soap and my seb derm is under control now.</li>
            <li> After several years of my husband having dry patches of skin on his face he started using Noble Cream.</li>
            <li> wash with noble bar during showers and I usually apply this cream twice a day (after shower and before sleep)</li>
            <li> in mind, I also have been exfoliating regularly and using a mild soap as was also suggested by the forums I visted.</li>
            <li> I have had moderate to severe seborrhea most of my life, and have struggled with various lotions to rid the redness and flaking.</li>
            <li> Her face is back to normal again, as soft and smooth as a little girl&#x27;s face should be, but we will be ordering more just to have on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have flaking or associated redness, I highly recommend you give this a try.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this purchase for someone with any skin issue.</li>
            <li> Many of the little bumps that have plagued me for years (never became pimples just looked like clogged pores or something but TONS)</li>
            <li> This cream completely eliminated the scaling around my nose and face!!</li>
            <li> Could find only 1 positive review that was positive on SLS and that warned against using anything with TEA in it.  </li>
            <li> and after you apply the cream, everything is normal.</li>
            <li> Pretty much cured my seborrheic dermatitis  (facial dandruff) which I didn&#x27;t even know was a thing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve concluded that the smell I was smelling is normal for this product.</li>
            <li> Well let me simply say that it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> We saw great results after about two days with this and it stung a little, but much less than that steroid treatment did.</li>
            <li> I have a very mild case of perioral dermatitis that only developed in the last year after having zero skin problems my whole life.</li>
            <li> , I had red dry patches of skin on my face mostly on my forehead.</li>
            <li> This cream is totally worth the hype and the money, especially if you have mild skin problems and live in a dry climate like I do.</li>
            <li> In the 3 days since I received it my bumps have gone down considerably and most are gone completely.  </li>
            <li> However, if I exercise in the morning before using it or find myself outside getting hot after I&#x27;ve put it on, my face sweats profusely in the areas where I&#x27;ve applied the cream.</li>
            <li> the ONLY downside for me is that they don&#x27;t ship this to my country;)</li>
            <li> I suspect MANY active people do, especially adults with acne, and have no idea!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend using anything on your face other than sulfur soap to clean it.</li>
            <li> It certainly helps calm down the flaking and the redness.</li>
            <li> My 19 year old developed seb dermatitis on the sides of his nose which wasn&#x27;t going away with normal skin care.</li>
            <li> Some didn&#x27;t work at all, and many only made a slight difference.</li>
            <li> Already had dry peeling skin, so what&#x27;s to lose right?  </li>
            <li> I tried things that made it WAY worse (oils, washing with Himalayan salt) and one day read a post about pyrithione zinc being amazing for seb derm.</li>
            <li> Takes awhile to get the hang of it, but I find if I clear up the scales myself before the cream that the result is no scales after the cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Dermatitis on my face for 30 years and have always had red blotchy scaling skin that was very embarrassing.  </li>
            <li> Thank you for selling this cream at such a reasonable cost.  </li>
            <li> My skin may be too sensitive for this product.</li>
            <li> Still have a complete jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and am prone to acne.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised that this did not cause my skin to break out.</li>
            <li> and I learned what it was, and that I was far from alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a bit surprised.</li>
            <li> Not being a chemist, I am not qualified to evaluate the merits of the reviews, but as the old saying goes &amp;#34;where</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my 8 year old daughter who started getting sebborhic dermatitis around her nose and eyelids.</li>
            <li> If you have really sensitive skin watch out with this.</li>
            <li> The whole time we systematically treated it with different medications and home remedies.</li>
            <li> My daughter has never needed the second jar we purchased, but I really don&#x27;t regret buying it just in case.</li>
            <li> I am 75 years old and had seborrhea all my life.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> but it is too early to say..</li>
            <li> One application of this cream about 10 days ago has completely stopped the scale.  </li>
            <li> Some stuff can keep seb derm at bay but not cure it completely.</li>
            <li> I suffer from minor pityrosporum folliculitis and didn&#x27;t want to spend money seeing a dermatologist without trying this product out first.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream, and within FOUR DAYS of use (about 2-3 applications per day), the problem spots were completely gone.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been washing my face religiously with a natural, gentle exfoliating cleanser and a Clarisonic facial brush, and I&#x27;m already noticing really promising results.</li>
            <li> I use daily when I get out of the shower and my face was immediately better after a few days and now it&#x27;s like I never had it.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I will write review again later after few more weeks.....</li>
            <li> I was excited when I got this cream, but in a few days I had a rash which I had to start treating with cortisone cream.  </li>
            <li> My husband has breakouts on his scalp and face--this formula (used in unions, soap and cream) has done more than any other product offered by doctors from one coast to the other.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve used it for a month or two now and it not only completely reversed one of the worse bright red flair ups</li>
            <li> I finally found that using salicylic acid (in the form of Neutrogena Acne Stress Control 3-in-1 Hydrating Acne Treatment) prior to applying the cream and using a double-dose of the Noble cream (applied, rubbed in, waited a few minutes and applied again) helped get rid of the last of it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t have spent so much $ on otc and rx stuff claiming it works for SD!</li>
            <li> I use it with my normal daily moisturizer</li>
            <li> Really the only cream I&#x27;ve found that works for facial outbreaks brought on by oil from your hair</li>
            <li> first I was applying the cream once a day, but I&#x27;ve now scaled it back to once every 2 or 3 days, and may cut back even further.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a major improvement in my seborrheic dermatitis.</li>
            <li> and there have been no other issues/impacts it has had on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth the extra ten dollars over the next lower priced similar item.</li>
            <li> It had finally cleared up, and then I developed tinea versicolor on my arms.  </li>
            <li> I had a spot on my chest that had some issues, especially when working out a lot, and this completely cured/controls it.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews of the other one (non-steroid) and became very optimistic.</li>
            <li> at first he used it every day, then gradually went down to 2-3 times a week, and now he&#x27;s using it only about once a week, and it still does the job!</li>
            <li> I tried everything OTC and Rx and had been mis-diagnosed by numerous docs &amp; dermatologists as having regular or hormonal acne, when it was actually being caused by sweat (I had told them I was a personal trainer and athlete and also live in a humid state).</li>
            <li> There has been a week where I haven&#x27;t had to apply it at all, but generally I&#x27;d say a couple times a week when I see it&#x27;s coming back.</li>
            <li> but this shampoo felt pretty harsh on my face.</li>
            <li> Within a few HOURS of the first use I began to see a difference.  </li>
            <li> This stuff will last a LONG time, I typically dab two fingers worth onto my forehead/cheeks and rub it in</li>
            <li> Before this I had tried so many other topical lotions, raw honey, apple cider vinegar, baking soda, jojoba oil, coconut oil, castor oil, oregano oil, and so many other oils (oils made my seb derm worse) before trying this..</li>
            <li> It seems very luxurious and the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 in the review is that I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to experience the possible long term benefits.</li>
            <li> I try to clear up the flakes first without making the redness worse.</li>
            <li> Our little girl developed a weird rash on her face which started above her top lip and grew and grew until it had worked its way around her mouth, spreading to her cheeks and on up to her eyelids.</li>
            <li> I have had some mystery skin problems for the last 5 years, with multiple fails on the part of dermatologists to accurately diagnose or properly treat me.</li>
            <li> I have not had a single reoccurrence, and I have only applied this maybe 8-9 times over the last 100+ days.</li>
            <li> I have used Alcortin in the past but this works much faster.  </li>
            <li> No more flare ups, itching, redness, flakes, absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> While it relieved the itchiness it did not last too long.  </li>
            <li> I am a 27 year old male with seb derm on the sides of nose, ears, and a little on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin red and dry.</li>
            <li> I have an illness that causes a specific kind of painful dermatitis.</li>
            <li> They sometimes work but are expensive and way too strong.</li>
            <li> Now I hav no severe breakouts and if I see or feel a little redness, I use this crean for a couple of days and it clears my skin up completely.</li>
            <li> A clean shave and a coating of Cetaphil would merely keep my seb deb at bay, while leaving me very red and shiny/oily.</li>
            <li> I thought I had a dry skin issue, but apparently not.</li>
            <li> One thing I will say is that it might burn a little the first few times you apply it.</li>
            <li> For a very ling time I have had an unsightly red rash on my fase (especially my nose) that multiple dermatologists failed to treat properly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the product can take as long as 4-6 weeks to work.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what took me so long to find out about and buy this cream.</li>
            <li> Much better results than other less expensive similar products on Amazon.</li>
            <li> (little red bumps around my nose and one of my eyes, and tiny areas of scaly, patchy skin) weren&#x27;t going away at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It started with very minor flaking on the eyebrows, then on the sides of the nose.</li>
            <li> I might have to go the natural way even though raw honey didn&#x27;t help either.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of continuous, at least twice daily use, the dermatitis is completely gone.  </li>
            <li> The pain usually last only a few mins</li>
            <li> Got me nervous since I see a lot of reviews seeing results in a few days, but I was willing to try any product for at least 2 weeks as long as it was bearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Note that the first couple of applications or so it looked like it was going to be worse.</li>
            <li> Used only for a few days, my red, scared,  and thick skin near my nose are gone.</li>
            <li> but after 1 application its half as red.  </li>
            <li> Skeptical as usual after testing so many products, I grabbed this and..</li>
            <li> Usually the redness and flaking only occurs on my upper lis and then cometimes between my eye brows.  </li>
            <li> I have tried multiple anti fungal treatment like lotrimin and anti dandruff soaps which only helped a little but usually comes back after 2-3 weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It may improve my condition a little, and the jar should last me a while, but I still have a hard time rationalizing the purchase due to the high price.</li>
            <li> It actually has little to no smell at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Around the two week area, morning applications are not as painful, redness is getting better, still a lot of flaking/scales.  </li>
            <li> It immediately soothes the rashes I get from unknown sources - maybe laundry soap.</li>
            <li> Now i have a cream i spent 30 bucks on for nothing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very expensive, yes, but a little goes a very long way and even after the 2 weeks of continuous use, most of the jar remains.</li>
            <li> Over the past 18 months my skin changed and my t-zone (above eyebrows, chin and around nose to lips) became so dry it would flake</li>
            <li> My face was so red and raw from my seb derm</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but I could probably cut back to a few times a week or less.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this and other products to hide the flaking but time to look for something else.t about the itchiness.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use this and other products to hide the flaking but time to look for something else.</li>
            <li> Then once, eventually every other day.</li>
            <li> Seb derm is an overproduction of oils because of hormones, yeast, and some other stuff.</li>
            <li> I put a few dabs of this on the sides of my nose and now the redness is finally going down!</li>
            <li> i bought this for my dad (about 6 months ago), who suffered from seborrheic dermatitis for a couple of years, and tried A LOT of other treatments (prescription drugs&amp;other OTC medications) with no success.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical and sure enough it made matters worse for me at least.</li>
            <li> initial review was negative due to the smell of the product, which I found (and still find) objectionable.</li>
            <li> Previously he had tried other over the counter products and has been under the care of a skin doctor who prescribe medicine that did not work.</li>
            <li> but I literally dropped down to tears after a week&#x27;s use of this product.</li>
            <li> I had to jump up and down and clench my fists to battle the burn.</li>
            <li> Itchiness is maybe slightly better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My confidence is the highest it&#x27;s been in half a decade..</li>
            <li> After that, flaky skin from my seborrheic dermatitis starts to show within a half hour.</li>
            <li> It baffled our doctor, who prescribed a steroid cream which ended up burning our little girl&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> My forehead was destroyed (massive flaking) and itching/burning so bad that I could barely concentrate at work, hard to sleep, no social life..</li>
            <li> When I need to apply it, I do it at night as you have to give it a few hours for it to take noticable effect imo.</li>
            <li> Finally growing tired of flare ups</li>
            <li> I do notice if I sweat or at the stage before you can visibly see the sweat, within a few hours after application it burns.  </li>
            <li> I do notice if I sweat or at the stage before you can visibly see the sweat, within a few hours after application it burns.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend purchasing this cream, it burns and stings when I put it on my face and actually makes my skin worse</li>
            <li> Seborrheic Dermatitis was destroying my forehead and nose area.</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t needed to use it for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> Mine was on my nose and cleres up after a few days using this product.</li>
            <li> seb derm had begun to flair up constantly and WAY worse than ever before, so I started looking into a ton of solutions.</li>
            <li> use it a few times a week.</li>
            <li> It did not help my skin at all, made it worse actually!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely embarassing to say the least.</li>
            <li> it smells pretty bad</li>
            <li> /&gt;Noble is the only cream I have ever used that works within a few days relieving me of those painful, itchy, scaling, and red splotches on my face.</li>
            <li> If the rash does ever rear its ugly head again, I know I will try this cream first off.  </li>
            <li> I usually have 1-3 pimples visible on my cheek area every week for the past few years and now they don&#x27;t appear.  </li>
            <li> not sure what it even did...</li>
            <li> No more itching.</li>
            <li> No more flaking.</li>
            <li> Then we were told it was a milk or citrus allergy, so no more dairy or citrus products for us.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure how pryithione zinc will interact with my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why they would make a product targeted to help seb derm but add SLS in the formula.</li>
            <li> Im not sure i will continue this product after its done.</li>
            <li> , I wasn&#x27;t seeing any improvement and the small problem areas</li>
            <li> This stuff I used everyday for a week, a very small amount.  </li>
            <li> Sadly my dermatitis came back hard.  </li>
            <li> Sadly my dermatitis came back hard.  </li>
            <li> It would be a vicious cycle of scrubbing the skinoff until it was raw, and then the oil free moisturizer she suggested would burn when I applied.  </li>
            <li> he puts this everyday where is needed which is his hand and his knees where he got some harden rash and became very thick layer skin..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Around the one week area, mornings are still painful, redness is slightly better, flakes are still bad during wake ups.  </li>
            <li> Alas, it&#x27;s still out of production and any bars left are too expensive.</li>
            <li> Late update.</li>
            <li> Within two weeks I developed seborrheic dermatitis on my face, and then a nasty red itching rash in my armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> complaint is the smell.</li>
            <li> I mean none.</li>
            <li> so I am serious here.</li>
            <li> seriously, get it.</li>
            <li> With my seb deb being bad, I decided to give it the shock treatment and go fourth with the steroid.</li>

            <li> My worst areas are forehead, nose (especially creases), and a couple spots around my mouth and chin areas.</li>
            <li> My hair and face was  flaking real bad,  and my face was really red.  </li>
            <li> no matter what I try it burns so bad and makes things worse.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have tried everything including rx Ketoconazole cream to try to keep my seborrheic dermatitis secret, or at least at bay. Nothing worked, not even the pyrithione zinc soap. I finally decided to give this a shot since it has a lot of 5 stars, and man am I glad I did! This stuff basically clears up all the red/flaky areas on my face, and the itch is gone! Note that the first couple of applications or so it looked like it was going to be worse. Areas became redder and instead of itch it was more of a light burn sensation. But I hung in there and after a month, I just apply as needed on areas that start to get red/scaly again before it gets to &amp;#34;full blown&amp;#34; problem. I first gently with my fingernail get all the flakes I can off the area without digging much, get rid of the looser ones. I try to clear up the flakes first without making the redness worse. Takes awhile to get the hang of it, but I find if I clear up the scales myself before the cream that the result is no scales after the cream. When I need to apply it, I do it at night as you have to give it a few hours for it to take noticable effect imo. My worst areas are forehead, nose (especially creases), and a couple spots around my mouth and chin areas. There has been a week where I haven&#x27;t had to apply it at all, but generally I&#x27;d say a couple times a week when I see it&#x27;s coming back. Remember that there is no cure for SD so the best you can do is to hide it and keep any itching at bay, and this cream is most definitely a goldmine for me. So glad I found this and wish I had sooner so I wouldn&#x27;t have spent so much $ on otc and rx stuff claiming it works for SD! Give it a go I say!</li>
            <li> Time will tell.  We need to give it a chance to work.  Ordered because it contains the same ingredient (pyrithione zinc) as a shampoo currently being used that has proved to be helpful.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for myself upon the recommendations of other reviewers for self-prescribed seborrheic dermatitis across my nose and cheeks, which was red, itchy, and peeling horribly.  I looked positively awful and was miserable.  Nothing worked for long, even the most emollient of creams.  Makeup felt like a crunchy mask that halfway through the day would begin to peel off my nose and cheeks, the skin underneath once again baboon-butt red and itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within 4 days, symptoms began to ease.  After 2 weeks of continuous, at least twice daily use, the dermatitis is completely gone.  This is a wonderful product and I&#x27;m so glad I took a chance.  It&#x27;s very expensive, yes, but a little goes a very long way and even after the 2 weeks of continuous use, most of the jar remains.</li>
            <li> It stings a lot going on, but then the next day, the lesion is better.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> not sure what it even did...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a variety of prescription and over-the-counter ointments and lotions to try to control t-zone seborrheic dermatitis. Some didn&#x27;t work at all, and many only made a slight difference. Finally growing tired of flare ups I tried to find the much lauded ZNP bar. Alas, it&#x27;s still out of production and any bars left are too expensive. So, I took a gamble and ordered the Noble Formula Cream. I know this sounds infommercial-ish, but within a day or two after the first use my skin looked better than it&#x27;s looked in a decade or more. My family is amazed at the difference in my skin. You cannot even tell that there&#x27;s a trace of seborrheic dermatitis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve yet to find any real downsides to the product, but I did have to get used to how it reacts on my skin. If you stay cool before and after you apply the cream, everything is normal. However, if I exercise in the morning before using it or find myself outside getting hot after I&#x27;ve put it on, my face sweats profusely in the areas where I&#x27;ve applied the cream. This subsides after an hour or so. I don&#x27;t find it that bothersome, but I&#x27;m sure some would find it very annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was applying the cream once a day, but I&#x27;ve now scaled it back to once every 2 or 3 days, and may cut back even further. I&#x27;ve gone a week without using it once, and my skin still looked great, but I don&#x27;t trust it&#x27;ll stay that away for too long so I&#x27;m just trying to find the right intervals to use the cream.</li>
            <li> This will be an ongoing review.  I use both the Noble Formula 2% Pyrithione Zinc Bar Soap and this cream simultaneously.  I have seborrheic dermatitis.  I have tried multiple anti fungal treatment like lotrimin and anti dandruff soaps which only helped a little but usually comes back after 2-3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash with noble bar during showers and I usually apply this cream twice a day (after shower and before sleep) sometimes 3 times (mid day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First few days of using this cream the mornings were very painful.  The pain usually last only a few mins but it feels like you pour alcohol on a wound.  I assume the pain is because my facial skin is &#x27;open&#x27;.  Night application not as painful especially if I did a midday one.  I notice that the redness and bumpiness actually increased and scales increased a lot during these days.  Scales not too visible with the cream on but when you wake up in the morning the flakes were all over my face especially the nose area.  Got me nervous since I see a lot of reviews seeing results in a few days, but I was willing to try any product for at least 2 weeks as long as it was bearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Around the one week area, mornings are still painful, redness is slightly better, flakes are still bad during wake ups.  Itchiness is same as before beginning treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Around the two week area, morning applications are not as painful, redness is getting better, still a lot of flaking/scales.  Itchiness is maybe slightly better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Around the three week area, morning applications have very little pain if any, redness is barely visible, scales are a lot better, practically 90 percent better.  My skin actually looks very good and soft, it actually looks a lot younger.  I usually have 1-3 pimples visible on my cheek area every week for the past few years and now they don&#x27;t appear.  Itchiness is still the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dec. 28 2014.  Currently on my fourth week.  I am happy about the redness and scaling being practically gone.  I&#x27;ll have to figure something out about the itchiness.  Mosquito bites do last 2-4 weeks on me so maybe a few more weeks the itchiness will be better.  I do notice if I sweat or at the stage before you can visibly see the sweat, within a few hours after application it burns.  So I may have to see if washing my face before doing any activity will help with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll do another update in a month.  Hopefully this review will help some of you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Late update. Sadly my dermatitis came back hard.  I will continue to use this and other products to hide the flaking but time to look for something else.t about the itchiness.

            <li> I&#x27;ve had Dermatitis on my face for 30 years and have always had red blotchy scaling skin that was very embarrassing.  I bought this after reading some reviews and tried it out because I had nothing to lose.  Already had dry peeling skin, so what&#x27;s to lose right?  This stuff I used everyday for a week, a very small amount.  Now after 5 months of using it, I now use it once or twice a week and have been doing it like this for 3 months.  I love this cream!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and it is really helping the rash he gets around his waist, nothing we have gotten before has worked, even things from the doctor.</li>
            <li> Even though this cream is unscented, in my opinion, it has a fresh, pleasant sent. It seems very luxurious and the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 in the review is that I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to experience the possible long term benefits.</li>
            <li> Works well for recurring Seborrheic dermatitis.  I have used Alcortin in the past but this works much faster.  I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I am AMAZED that this cream works so well!  I only write reviews for a product that is truly exceptional and this Nobel Formula Cream is it.  In the 3 days since I received it my bumps have gone down considerably and most are gone completely.  Thank you for selling this cream at such a reasonable cost.  Truly in this day where medication is needed and those who cannot afford, someone has a true good heart.  If you have Lichen Planus, you must buy this cream as relief is only an application away.  Thank you, whomever you are.  I could kiss your feet.</li>
            <li> Stopped the itching fast.  Hasn&#x27;t cleared up associated problem, but apparently&lt;br /&gt;the product can take as long as 4-6 weeks to work.  So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I have been using this and I am seeing some good results!! I am very pleased with this purchase!!</li>
            <li> My mother and I suffer from the same skin condition.  I brought the noble cream around 6 mos ago and it did an amazing job on my face.  I introduced it to my mother and she loves it.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using both their shampoo and face cream.  I&#x27;ve noticed a major improvement in my seborrheic dermatitis. It certainly helps calm down the flaking and the redness.</li>
            <li> Pretty much cured my seborrheic dermatitis  (facial dandruff) which I didn&#x27;t even know was a thing and I&#x27;ve been fighting it for years with every lotion and cream I could find. I use daily when I get out of the shower and my face was immediately better after a few days and now it&#x27;s like I never had it. I still use daily but I could probably cut back to a few times a week or less. The amount you get goes along ways.</li>
            <li> [Update March 2015]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial review was negative due to the smell of the product, which I found (and still find) objectionable. I&#x27;m still deducting one star for that. But the results don&#x27;t lie, and a year or more later, my seb derm is fully under control. I used to have flaking and itching around my nose and eyebrows, and the sides of my nose were perpetually red from the corticosteroids, but I haven&#x27;t used a drop of steroid since I started with Noble Formula, and my skin has more or less recovered. Nothing else I tried before worked. So I really recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The longer story is that I had a lengthy correspondence with Lorelei from Ontos, and she was very helpful in providing replacement jars. I&#x27;ve concluded that the smell I was smelling is normal for this product. However, Lorelei went further and mixed me up a custom batch of their Emu Lac with pyrithione zinc! This cream smells quite good, and the results seem to be pretty much equivalent. It&#x27;s what I use now. So I applaud Ontos for awesome customer relations!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried not applying the cream for several days at a time in the last week, and it seems like the flaking is coming back and I&#x27;ll have to keep using the cream. So it isn&#x27;t really a cure in my case, but it&#x27;s great at controlling the symptoms!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Original review]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch, but mine smells like a tub of lard gone bad. It&#x27;s especially stinky once applied. Close to unbearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t quite figure out what the expiration date on it is, if any. The writing on the bottom is literally:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SP2103 4&lt;br /&gt;0047845 09-16&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any idea what that might mean?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is off-white, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it yellowish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nobody has mentioned smell in any reviews, so I assume it&#x27;s not supposed to smell like death...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it seems to be working better than anything I&#x27;ve tried, though it&#x27;s hard to be sure after just once week.</li>
            <li> it smells pretty bad but it works well. the only shortcoming is the too much bigger scale. when can i use it out.</li>
            <li> My skin may be too sensitive for this product. Makes my skin red and dry. I don&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Really the only cream I&#x27;ve found that works for facial outbreaks brought on by oil from your hair</li>
            <li> Excellent cream! I use it all over my face and it has helped my redness immensely!</li>
            <li> After 30 years I&#x27;ve stopped using hydrocortisone cream on my face!!!  I used a gentle cleanser (Walmart brand Cetphil) and then used Nobel Cream for 2 weeks.  Now all I use is the gentle cleanser and I have no symptoms.  Hydrocortisone cream seems to be an effective treatment of the symptoms, but the Noble Cream seems to have taken care of the cause of the problem. Note: I also tried the Noble soap, but it stung my eyes. The soap may be effective on other parts of the body though.</li>
            <li> It may work it may not.  I get this rash on my jaw line if I don&#x27;t shave for a while.  I was told pyrithione zinc would help.  It may improve my condition a little, and the jar should last me a while, but I still have a hard time rationalizing the purchase due to the high price.</li>
            <li> Helped clear up a HORRIBLE case of seborrheic dermatitis on my face.  Wash with salicylic acid soap twice daily and apply this cream multiple times a day.</li>
            <li> The absolute best cream out there. After losing hope and using moisturizer after moisturizer this nobale formula cream cured me. I never write any reviews about anything, but i felt obligated to share. I wish i had known of this product earlier</li>
            <li> Noble formula cream with pyrithione zinc is just another weapon in a good arsenal to combat skin irritations. I found the product to be helpful and worth the purchase. I will buy again if needed.</li>
            <li> Figured out that my dermatitis was triggered by refined sugars and excess caffeine. Applied this cream after using a zinc based soap. First twice a day. Then once, eventually every other day.Now  lets wait and see. Have not used it for a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face cleared and it has stayed clean for the last month or so. After aggressive flare ups. I was fortunate to discover a trigger and a cure** for my point of view.&lt;br /&gt;This cream worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did not have to us a lot of it. Still have a complete jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** its under control...</li>
            <li> I have a mild case of seborrheic dermatitis, however it&#x27;s been bugging me for all my life. The way I combatted it until recently was by using a shampoo with Pyrithione Zinc but this shampoo felt pretty harsh on my face. So I switched to this gel, been using it for a week now and my SD has been cleared up more than it ever did !! I&#x27;d say 98-99% is gone ! So, love this gel ! Only thing that&#x27;s not too good is the smell, it smells very &#x27;chemical&#x27;, but I don&#x27;t mind that too much. Great product !</li>
            <li> I would not recommend purchasing this cream, it burns and stings when I put it on my face and actually makes my skin worse</li>
            <li> My skin problems started with perioral dermatitis. It had finally cleared up, and then I developed tinea versicolor on my arms.  My doctor recommended dandruff shampoo with selenium sulfide to kill the fungus, but it created an itch.  Within two weeks I developed seborrheic dermatitis on my face, and then a nasty red itching rash in my armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream rescued my skin.  It relieved the itching, and within days I was able to put foundation on my face without my skin peeling off.  The armpit rash and eyebrow &amp;#34;dandruff&amp;#34; took the longest to go away - about five weeks.  I finally found that using salicylic acid (in the form of Neutrogena Acne Stress Control 3-in-1 Hydrating Acne Treatment) prior to applying the cream and using a double-dose of the Noble cream (applied, rubbed in, waited a few minutes and applied again) helped get rid of the last of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and am prone to acne.  I was surprised that this did not cause my skin to break out.</li>
            <li> This seems to work well for a non prescription cream.  It&#x27;s not oily or greasy and doesn&#x27;t have an offensive smell</li>
            <li> It does not work at all.</li>
            <li> I have had some mystery skin problems for the last 5 years, with multiple fails on the part of dermatologists to accurately diagnose or properly treat me. Found this lotion and have been using it once daily for more than 3 months and have seen a real improvement (a first! Much better than the ketoconazole I had been prescribed). Went from 2 weeks/month of outbreak to 2 days/month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is the smell. It smells kind of rancid. Though to be honest, I prefer that to a strong &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is the first review I have ever made on Amazon because I really feel this product helped me a LOT!! I had a very severe case of Seborrheic Dermatitis...itchy, red, burning, flaking forehead (have on my scalp too but trying Nizoral for that)...My forehead was destroyed (massive flaking) and itching/burning so bad that I could barely concentrate at work, hard to sleep, no social life..I&#x27;m about 90% better after using this product for two weeks..it does sting and burn for quite a while after applying..it seemed to not help the first couple of days but I stuck with it and now I&#x27;m so much better! Before this I had tried so many other topical lotions, raw honey, apple cider vinegar, baking soda, jojoba oil, coconut oil, castor oil, oregano oil, and so many other oils (oils made my seb derm worse) before trying this..I HATE this disease so I hope and pray this review could somehow help someone else suffering from this same thing!!!</li>
            <li> This is my review for the Noble Formula HC Cream w/ Hydrocortisone 1% product, but I wanted to share my experiences here as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noble Formula has changed my life. I&#x27;m 25, but every year since I was 20 or so, my skin got worse and worse with Seborrheic Dermatitis. It got to the point I&#x27;d only go out if I was having a good (skin) day. A clean shave and a coating of Cetaphil would merely keep my seb deb at bay, while leaving me very red and shiny/oily. This was my every day, year after year. I thought it was just dry skin, I became so sick of it, I started doing a lot of research and I learned what it was, and that I was far from alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It started with very minor flaking on the eyebrows, then on the sides of the nose. It spread to the ears and cheeks below the eyes, then onto the chin and above the lip. If you know anyone with any of these symptoms, please, point them here. They suffer, they are subconscious, but you can change their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seb deb ended up making close face to face contact for me impossible, finding a date impossible, and routinely looking at the reflection on my phone to see how I was holding up when I was out and about during the day. I started looking for zinc based as I learned it&#x27;s actually a fungus and zinc is fungicidal and that&#x27;s how I found noble formula. I read the reviews of the other one (non-steroid) and became very optimistic. With my seb deb being bad, I decided to give it the shock treatment and go fourth with the steroid. Good decision... Let me tell you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had almost immediate relief. I have not had a single reoccurrence, and I have only applied this maybe 8-9 times over the last 100+ days. In fact, I periodically re-apply, just incase, not because I&#x27;m having seb deb rear it&#x27;s (very) ugly head again. My confidence is the highest it&#x27;s been in half a decade.. and I&#x27;ve been on many dates since. Boom!</li>
            <li> I have had seborrheic dermatitis in my scalp since I was 13 and have been trying to find ways to keep it at bay since. I use the various selsun blue and zinc shampoos which wreak havoc on my hair but hey I gotta do whatâ€™s best for my scalp. The thing is the shampoos help for a while but then I would get used to them and the itching and flaking would return with a vengeance. One day I came across this product on amazon and thought I have nothing to lose. I use it on my scalp and it works like a charm. No more itching. No more flaking. I mean none. I use it once a week or after I wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is described as a cream but itâ€™s a bit on the liquid side. When I opened the container it literally spilled out. I was a bit surprised. I was expecting more of a paste. I really and truly have no complaints. I do not experience any discomfort or side effects from using this product. I have been using it for going on 3 weeks now. It works really great for me.</li>
            <li> I have had seb derm for 20 plus years and this product helping right away! Thanks.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle cream. It immediately soothes the rashes I get from unknown sources - maybe laundry soap. I recommend it</li>
            <li> Pyrithine Zic with oil based cream , it does not go together , if you have dermatitis. So I don&#x27;t thing it is worth.</li>
            <li> Suggest any prospective buyer research Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (spelled laurel on label) and TEA listed on ingredients lable. Could find only 1 positive review that was positive on SLS and that warned against using anything with TEA in it.  Not being a chemist, I am not qualified to evaluate the merits of the reviews, but as the old saying goes &amp;#34;where there&#x27;s smoke, there&#x27;s fire&amp;#34; might be taken into consideration.</li>
            <li> While it relieved the itchiness it did not last too long.  Have been using a combination of apple cider vinegar and Clobestasol Propionate and that has done much better than this cream.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my 8 year old daughter who started getting sebborhic dermatitis around her nose and eyelids. She had red bumps, with dryness and scaling, and was beginning to be embarrassed by them. I didn&#x27;t want to use a steroid on her face, and some creams burned or caused stinging. I found this recommended by Dr. Oz, and It is amazing! The redness goes away within hours and feels smooth and soft on her skin. I am so glad we found this!</li>
            <li> I am a 50 year old female who has always had great skin.  Over the past 18 months my skin changed and my t-zone (above eyebrows, chin and around nose to lips) became so dry it would flake and there would be about 10 layers of skin in that area around my nose. According to my dermo it is facial dandruff.  It would be a vicious cycle of scrubbing the skinoff until it was raw, and then the oil free moisturizer she suggested would burn when I applied.  Then it would turn to alligator skin again, etc etc.  Makeup looked awful because I could never get all the flakes off :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this cream along with the pyrithione zinc soap on amazon and thought I would give it a try. I did feel immediate results however it took a full 4 weeks until all my skin was soft and smooth.  You have to be diligent and use it twice a day but it saved my face!  I look awesome :)</li>
            <li> My 19 year old developed seb dermatitis on the sides of his nose which wasn&#x27;t going away with normal skin care. Once we figured out what it was, I did some reading and ordered this product. Wowza! He looked noticeably better after one day, in three days it was gone. He&#x27;s still using it once daily and it hasn&#x27;t returned.</li>
            <li> I have an illness that causes a specific kind of painful dermatitis. My dermatologist prescribed a .01 cortisone mixture, but it didn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;Noble is the only cream I have ever used that works within a few days relieving me of those painful, itchy, scaling, and red splotches on my face.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading some forums about how to possibly treat ezcema without prescription drugs. Around season changes my nose, around my eyes, under my moustache and goat-tee all break out. Redness, itchiness, flaky grossness. It&#x27;s extremely embarassing to say the least. I ordered this cream on the rceommendation of a forum I found suggesting a zync facial cream as a possible treatment. 1 hour later my skin around my nose looks almost the same color as the skin around it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bear in mind, I also have been exfoliating regularly and using a mild soap as was also suggested by the forums I visted. I thought I had a dry skin issue, but apparently not. This stuff is working great, I will update soon with more conclusive results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Been using for about a week, all my redness and flaking is gone!</li>
            <li> This might seem a bit over the top but I literally dropped down to tears after a week&#x27;s use of this product. Seborrheic Dermatitis was destroying my forehead and nose area. It&#x27;s been about a month since I started using the product... No more flare ups, itching, redness, flakes, absolutely nothing. My skin looks great. It is also very gentle on the skin, doesn&#x27;t clog pores. One thing I will say is that it might burn a little the first few times you apply it. The burning subsides after an hour or so. Try and apply to the areas when you aren&#x27;t having a flare up.</li>
            <li> After several years of my husband having dry patches of skin on his face he started using Noble Cream. For the first time in years he no longer has his skin problem. Previously he had tried other over the counter products and has been under the care of a skin doctor who prescribe medicine that did not work. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a rash on the side of my nostril for almost a year.  I&#x27;ve tried various remedies, including prescription cream.  The Noble Formula cream is working as well or better than the prescription med.  I have been using it on my entire face and I&#x27;m seeing an improvement in the overall tone and color of my skin.  It is also healing the sandpaper roughness on my elbows.  I&#x27;ll continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I had been trying everything to help with my breakouts for YEARS! I am 38 so I am serious here. I tried everything OTC and Rx and had been mis-diagnosed by numerous docs &amp; dermatologists as having regular or hormonal acne, when it was actually being caused by sweat (I had told them I was a personal trainer and athlete and also live in a humid state). Anyway, I found an article online about pityrosporum folliculitis which can be treated with zinc so I decided to give this a try. I have only been using it about a month but I have noticed a huge difference. I use a zinc soap as well and try to wash &amp; put this on before &amp; after anytime I will be sweating. Many of the little bumps that have plagued me for years (never became pimples just looked like clogged pores or something but TONS) have actually gone away and there are now regular pores there! I can not tell you how badly I wish I had known about this years ago!! I would not have picked at these and scarred my face up LOL! This is a great product that will help you if you have this type of acne alone or in combination with others. I suspect MANY active people do, especially adults with acne, and have no idea! It also is soothing, moisturizing, and can go under make-up with no problem. Great ingredients and totally ROCKS!</li>
            <li> After a long time of product trial and error for my scaly scalp seborrheic dermatitis, I purchased Noble Formula Cream from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had never even heard of this product, but after reading through reviews I decided to take a chance and try the Noble cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the FIRST application, my flakey/scaly patches have not come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was kind of pricey ($29.99+ free s&amp;h), but I used my Amazon points to purchase. Honestly even without the points it is totally worth its price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dealt with seborrheic dermatitis for a while, and am glad to have FINALLY found relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way. I have soo much product remaining, so I plan on using it once a week after washing(as a preventative measure).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt;Google \\&quot;scalp psoriasis vs. seborrheic dermatitis\\&quot; to know the difference between scalp psoriasis &amp; seborrheic dermatitis. (I self diagnosed myself before seeing a derm)&amp;lt;&amp;lt;</li>
            <li> Very good for problem skin</li>
            <li> Using in conjunction with the soap and so far so good so giving it 5 stars like the soap. Figured I would never know if it would work for my unless I tried it. Am glad I did.</li>
            <li> I only used it 2 days because It burned so bad that i couldn&#x27;t take it. I have seb derm and no matter what I try it burns so bad and makes things worse. I might have to go the natural way even though raw honey didn&#x27;t help either. If you have really sensitive skin watch out with this. Might burn you like it did for me. Now i have a cream i spent 30 bucks on for nothing. I was skeptical and sure enough it made matters worse for me at least. My redness won&#x27;t ever go away however i wanna control my flaking.</li>
            <li> My face was so red and raw from my seb derm but after 1 application its half as red.  Thank you for giving me hope.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what I look like tomorrow!</li>
            <li> Our little girl developed a weird rash on her face which started above her top lip and grew and grew until it had worked its way around her mouth, spreading to her cheeks and on up to her eyelids. This started in the summer and continued on into the winter months. The whole time we systematically treated it with different medications and home remedies. We treated it for ringworm, impetigo, yeast, bacteria, herpes, you name it. It just didnt respond to anything we tried. Then we were told it was a milk or citrus allergy, so no more dairy or citrus products for us.  It faded for a couple weeks and came back with a vengeance. This time it wasn&#x27;t only bright red, her skin stared to flake. It was horrible!  It baffled our doctor, who prescribed a steroid cream which ended up burning our little girl&#x27;s face. My husband found this Noble Formula Cream online. I read the reviews and we both agreed to give it a try. I&#x27;m so glad we did. It has worked where nothing else did. We used it three times a day upon waking, after lunch, and before bed. We saw great results after about two days with this and it stung a little, but much less than that steroid treatment did. (those were her words) We haven&#x27;t needed to use it for a few weeks now. I wish I could include a couple of before and after photos.  Her face is back to normal again, as soft and smooth as a little girl&#x27;s face should be, but we will be ordering more just to have on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: It is now almost 2 years later. My daughter has never needed the second jar we purchased, but I really don&#x27;t regret buying it just in case. If the rash does ever rear its ugly head again, I know I will try this cream first off.  My best wishes and prayers to those who suffer with rashes like hers.</li>
            <li> I am 75 years old and had seborrhea all my life. I was using prescription selenium sulfide 2.5% shampoo for years, but it stopped working. My hair and face was  flaking real bad,  and my face was really red.  I bought noble formula and applied it to my face and it stopped flaking and the redness was gone. I also use head  and shoulders with pyrithione zinc shampoo.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the results and the barber that cuts my hair could not believe it either. I would recommend to anyone especially folks with  seborrhea.</li>
            <li> I thank Amazon.com for referring me to this product when I purchased Aveeno Sunburn Protection (SPF 30) for the face. I have suffered from Seborrhea Dermatitis for forty-five (45) years.  I have used prescription and non-prscription creams and none were very effective.  This cream completely eliminated the scaling around my nose and face!! I put the cream on once or twice a day.  It includes Pyrithione Zinc (ZNP) .25%.  I no longer have white scales on my face!!  I showed my Dermatologist and she was amazed.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. OK, ewwwww - I have sebhorreic dermatitis (the grown-up version of cradle cap?) in one ear. Drives me NUTS. Five days of using this three or four times a day and it&#x27;s 95% gone and healing. Wow.</li>
            <li> After reading all the ratings, I thought this product would work better.  The first time I used it, it was awesome!  After that, flaky skin from my seborrheic dermatitis starts to show within a half hour.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been to a dermatologist but think I have seborrheic dermatitis, redness, flaking and itching around my nose, eye brows, chin, etc. I always used hydrocortizone cremes and they worked sometimes but I didn&#x27;t like using them. Then I tried Neosporin Eczema Essential Daily Moisturizer and it reall worked well for a while but then I had a \\&quot;rebound\\&quot; effect and it doesn&#x27;t seem to work (although I still like that product too). I&#x27;ve been using Noble Formula for over a month and I have not had any eruptions or rebounds. So far it&#x27;s working great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve battled seborrheic dermatitis for 20+ years. I have used steroids and various Rx creams. They sometimes work but are expensive and way too strong. Within a few HOURS of the first use I began to see a difference.  Two weeks in and my face is in better shape than the last 20 years. Fantastic. It smells like the devil&#x27;s butt, but it is great stuff.</li>
            <li> For a very ling time I have had an unsightly red rash on my fase (especially my nose) that multiple dermatologists failed to treat properly. Noble Formula Cream with Pyrithione Zinc did the trick. Now I hav no severe breakouts and if I see or feel a little redness, I use this crean for a couple of days and it clears my skin up completely. I have also found that every time i shower washing my face in Head &amp; Shoulders basic dandruff shampoo helps manage the rash.</li>
            <li> He is still trying this product... he puts this everyday where is needed which is his hand and his knees where he got some harden rash and became very thick layer skin..anyway we have tried many product on it but non of them worked.&lt;br /&gt;this one is same thing, I don&#x27;t think it is working.... but it is too early to say..&lt;br /&gt;I will write review again later after few more weeks.....</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream at the same time I bought Noble Formula Zinc Soap.  Since I have been using the zinc soap and this moisture cream my face has not had a outbreak.  I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Works great for seb derm. Mine was on my nose and cleres up after a few days using this product.</li>
            <li> I do not have dandruff, but I have a couple spots that tend to get \\&quot;scale\\&quot;, if that is the correct medical term.  Once a week use of  a pyrithione shampoo worked okay, but I was looking for something better.  One application of this cream about 10 days ago has completely stopped the scale.  I expect additional treatments in the future, but at this rate, this jar of cream is a lifetime supply.</li>
            <li> If you have flaking or associated redness, I highly recommend you give this a try. I have tried a lot of different products. My latest attempt was a tar-based psoriasin or something. Smelled like auto exhaust and didnt do anything for me.&lt;br /&gt;ONE DAY of using this cream and 90% of the flaking was gone. TWO DAYS of using this cream and 100% of flaking was gone, and 90% of redness was gone.&lt;br /&gt;I really hope this keeps up.</li>
            <li> No result from use. VAseline works better. Discontinued use after 3 weeks. May try again in the summer or fall.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what changed but the last year my facial (t zone) seb derm had begun to flair up constantly and WAY worse than ever before, so I started looking into a ton of solutions. I tried things that made it WAY worse (oils, washing with Himalayan salt) and one day read a post about pyrithione zinc being amazing for seb derm. Skeptical as usual after testing so many products, I grabbed this and.. It&#x27;s been incredible. I think I&#x27;ve used it for a month or two now and it not only completely reversed one of the worse bright red flair ups I&#x27;d ever had (post washing with salt, ugh) but I haven&#x27;t been red at all since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it a few times a week. This stuff will last a LONG time, I typically dab two fingers worth onto my forehead/cheeks and rub it in and I&#x27;ve not made a dent in the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try. The only issues I have now are with my scalp. I&#x27;m tempted to just shove this crap onto my head but I&#x27;m not sure how pryithione zinc will interact with my hair.</li>
            <li> But-- its GREAT STUFF!  Here again I had to rely on product information provided by Amazon through product hardcopy and--&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;reviews&#x27; of others that shop AMAZON.  I ordered the soap too.  Pricey?  Yes.  But if you have a family member or friend who struggles with the curse of seborrheic dermatitis (for which there is no known cure) BUY this.  My husband has breakouts on his scalp and face--this formula (used in unions, soap and cream) has done more than any other product offered by doctors from one coast to the other.  He gets it cleared-- and stops his regiment and here it comes again.  This works so good-- that he gets too comfortable-- forgets-- and its back again.  This product \\&quot;zaps\\&quot; it but nothing \\&quot;cures\\&quot; the kind of dermatitis he has so he is awfully grateful to learn of something he KNOWS will bring him relief.  Again- if it hadn&#x27;t been for AMAZON we probably would never have learned of this product.</li>
            <li> So like most eczema sufferers I do tons of research and came across this product and bought it without hesitation because of all the fantastic reviews! I was so excited, I had red dry patches of skin on my face mostly on my forehead. When I tried this product my face was BURNING- I have creams that stung before and trust me I can handle it but this was not a stinging sensation. I had to jump up and down and clench my fists to battle the burn. It did not help my skin at all, made it worse actually! I am now using cerave cream and have noticed a substantial difference!</li>
            <li> I am a 27 year old male with seb derm on the sides of nose, ears, and a little on my scalp. Ive been dealing with this for over 5 years. Nothing is really 100% effective and ive tried everything. Some stuff can keep seb derm at bay but not cure it completely. I have tried  almost all medications in existence, and stopped most of them because of the long term side effects. Sulfur soap helps keep my face clean and that&#x27;s all it can do. It doesn&#x27;t remove the redness. With seb derm you need to target the oil, but also remove bacteria. Sulfur soap removes only the bacteria. I don&#x27;t recommend using anything on your face other than sulfur soap to clean it. Don&#x27;t use anything with oil in it, as you&#x27;re adding oil on top of the oils your face produces from having seb derm. Seb derm is an overproduction of oils because of hormones, yeast, and some other stuff. To make a long story short, i use this noble cream in combination with sulfur soap and my seb derm is under control now. This product will not work without something to remove the oils and bacteria from your face. I put a few dabs of this on the sides of my nose and now the redness is finally going down! I will continue to use it and report back. My only gripe about this product is that it contains &amp;#34;SLS&amp;#34; sodium laureth sulfate. SLS has been linked to seb derm on multiple case studies. I&#x27;m not sure why they would make a product targeted to help seb derm but add SLS in the formula. I don&#x27;t use anything with SLS in it. I gave this a shot but was very disappointed it included this ingredient. I like that it removes the redness but SLS should NOT be in this product. Also, if you have seb derm you should stop using toothpastes that have fluoride in them and NOT use products that include ANY sulfates. Im not sure i will continue this product after its done.</li>
            <li> Used only for a few days, my red, scared,  and thick skin near my nose are gone. Wish I knew this product earlier.</li>
            <li> Just so you know. Very disappointed. This stuff has sodium laurel sulfate in it. This is what causes skin irritations. Why would you put it in something that&#x27;s supposed to fix them.</li>
            <li> I have had moderate to severe seborrhea most of my life, and have struggled with various lotions to rid the redness and flaking. This lotion is the best product I have found for my problem, clearing up the symptoms in a few days. I recommend a nightly application before bed to allow the medication to work its magic overnight.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I got this cream, but in a few days I had a rash which I had to start treating with cortisone cream.  Unless you&#x27;re allergic like me, it would probably be fine.</li>
            <li> I suffered with dermatitis for 15 years nothing worked. Doctor perscribed steroids cured symptoms but made it worse.  This cream cured it, 100% gone no joke.  Thank you noble you changed my life.</li>
            <li> This cream has brought me great relief from seasonal allergies It may not smell so sweet but is very effective and soothing to my skin. Thank you for relieving my symptoms.</li>
            <li> I have a skin condition that this cream keeps in check! I would recommend it first before trying a prescription cream.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my dad (about 6 months ago), who suffered from seborrheic dermatitis for a couple of years, and tried A LOT of other treatments (prescription drugs&amp;other OTC medications) with no success. so after reading the reviews i decided to get this for him, and it&#x27;s the only thing he tried that works! at first he used it every day, then gradually went down to 2-3 times a week, and now he&#x27;s using it only about once a week, and it still does the job! i know some people wrote here that it didn&#x27;t work for them, but it worked for him and definitely worth a try, it&#x27;s such an easy (and cheap!) solution. the ONLY downside for me is that they don&#x27;t ship this to my country;) seriously, get it.</li>
            <li> Seems to be doing its job well</li>
            <li> Instant relief. Totally worth the extra ten dollars over the next lower priced similar item. Trust me it is worth it</li>
            <li> Skin on my forhead, nose and cheeks gets red/flaky. I&#x27;ve used the ZNP bar before, as well as oatmeal/Zinc soap. This seems to work the best. I am not breaking out, but it is also controlling the skin well. I had a spot on my chest that had some issues, especially when working out a lot, and this completely cured/controls it.</li>
            <li> We love Noble Formula Cream. This product takes the itch away almost immediately. We are glad that this was recommended by a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I suffer from minor pityrosporum folliculitis and didn&#x27;t want to spend money seeing a dermatologist without trying this product out first. Boy am I glad I did!!! It was only 3 days after using this cream that the redness cleared up and the bumps were noticeably clearing up on my chest and neck. I am currently waiting for my Noble Formula bar soap to arrive to see how it works with the cream. I would highly recommend this purchase for someone with any skin issue. Also, it doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as people say it does. It actually has little to no smell at all.</li>
            <li> It stopped my skin from flaking, both on face and arms.  I will continue to purchase  this product in the future.  Great stuff, I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This product is great for keeping my dermatitis away!  Helps calm, moisturize, reduce redness and scaling caused by dermatitis.  Thank you Nobel Fornula! :)</li>
            <li> Much better results than other less expensive similar products on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Best solution for getting rid of red, scaly, itchy skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried all sorts of things to deal with my skin condition.  Usually the redness and flaking only occurs on my upper lis and then cometimes between my eye brows.  I&#x27;ve used dandruff shampoo, scalpicin, cortisone creams (which was the most succesful), but nothing ever made it go away for a long time.  It was especially bad in the winter time.  Well, I decided to tray this product but was a bit hesistant because of the price.  Well let me simply say that it is worth it.  It&#x27;s a very light cream, so you don&#x27;t need a lot to cover the area in question.  I have no doubt this one jar will last me well over 1 year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll purchase it again without any hesistation...it take away the redness and flaking and quite frankly I use it every day now to be on the safe side...haven&#x27;t have any redness or flaking since the day I started using it and there have been no other issues/impacts it has had on my skin.  I&#x27;ll buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what took me so long to find out about and buy this cream. It&#x27;s magic! I have a very mild case of perioral dermatitis that only developed in the last year after having zero skin problems my whole life. I was given some greasy prescription ointment by my doctor and after almost three months of use, I wasn&#x27;t seeing any improvement and the small problem areas (little red bumps around my nose and one of my eyes, and tiny areas of scaly, patchy skin) weren&#x27;t going away at all. So I decided to try some more natural and over the counter remedies and ditch the prescription. I bought this cream, and within FOUR DAYS of use (about 2-3 applications per day), the problem spots were completely gone. Crazy! The cream is not greasy or sticky at all and is very soothing. It really just feels like a nice, rich moisturizer. I use it with my normal daily moisturizer and I&#x27;ve been washing my face religiously with a natural, gentle exfoliating cleanser and a Clarisonic facial brush, and I&#x27;m already noticing really promising results. This cream is totally worth the hype and the money, especially if you have mild skin problems and live in a dry climate like I do.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who has Lichen Planus.  This actually made him itch more so we returned it.</li>
