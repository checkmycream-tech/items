            <li>I was very impressed though!</li>
            <li>It smells so good and is the perfect size.</li>
            <li>This item is a great size, but no pumps.  </li>
            <li>I like that he has a touch of fragrance, fly in the ointment</li>
            <li>Works great with Brazilian,Peruvian, Malaysian hair</li>
            <li>how well I liked it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this as my primary shampoo/conditioner for a couple months now and very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Good price,  smells nice.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and price of this shampoo!  </li>
            <li>I like this shampoo and conditioner use these products then the serum nice results.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything better than these!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Was looking for a top rated shampoo and conditioner, and these products did not disappoint.</li>
            <li>Love Love Love This Shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>I can go now every other day now and have nice shiny hair and it awesome!</li>
            <li>Made my hair silky smooth...</li>
            <li>This product did not work well for my hair, which surprised me as reviews are so good.  </li>
            <li>Works great with the flat iron!</li>
            <li>but I would say its the next best thing to professional products.</li>
            <li>However I really love the smell of professional hair products I normally don&#x27;t buy Tresemme..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no that I&#x27;m rating the actual shampoo and conditioner this poorly, it&#x27;s mostly for the fact that the conditioner opened up while en route.  </li>
            <li>This is the first keratin shampoo I have tried</li>
            <li>I have naturally fine but chemically lightened hair which is now super dry &amp; frizzy.</li>
            <li>I have wavy hair, and here the summers get pretty hot and extremely humid on most days.</li>
            <li>especially the strong odor.</li>
            <li>I would love to find a more natural product that can give the same great results, but I&#x27;ve tried several with disastrous outcomes and keep coming to tresemme&#x27;s keratin smooth combo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall really like the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li>but it smells very chemically.</li>
            <li>used it several times to give it a good chance, but ended up tossing the unused portion as I disliked it so much</li>
            <li>Make my hair feel soft and silky!</li>
            <li>I had been using cheap shampoos and conditioners, and they were turning my hair into a mess.</li>
            <li>For the price I was surprised</li>
            <li>When I don&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on professional hair products I will buy Tresemme.</li>
            <li>This is the only shampoo/conditioner I have found that keeps my hair manageable, untangled and soft.</li>
            <li>I give this 3 stars because the only hair products that get 5 starts are professional products.</li>
            <li>In addition to making my hair extremely soft and shiny and cutting down on tangles, it helps to keep my hair more smooth on those humid, frizzy days.</li>
            <li>and so far my hair is less frizzy and feels so soft!</li>

            <li> Not sure if all keratin shampoo has this odor</li>
            <li> is that the packaging is not very good.</li>
            <li> I mean I had really bad greasy hair</li>

            <li> This item is a great size, but no pumps.  However, the products just didnt meet my hair standards.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful combo of shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> This product did not work well for my hair, which surprised me as reviews are so good.

            <li> Love the smell and price of this shampoo!  It works well and doesnt seem to dry out my hair.  I&#x27;m not a shampoo snob, but I do get picky about drying out my hair.</li>

However I really love the smell of professional hair products I normally don&#x27;t buy Tresemme.. but I would say its the next best thing to professional products. When I don&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on professional hair products I will buy Tresemme. I have worked in sells at a hair salon before so I know my Hair products.  However what works for somebodies hair may not work for yours. I give this 3 stars because the only hair products that get 5 starts are professional products. I was very impressed though!</li>
            <li> Works great with Brazilian,Peruvian, Malaysian hair</li>
