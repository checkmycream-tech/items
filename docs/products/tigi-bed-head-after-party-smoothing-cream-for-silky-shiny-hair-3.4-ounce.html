            <li>Fast shipping......</li>
            <li>I have very curly sometimes unruly hair.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t have a need for this</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t really for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I say it&#x27;s okay for a general quick fix but just not as well as I expected.</li>
            <li>After Party Cream totally tames and smooths my hair down to a manageable and gorgeous wave.</li>
            <li>But I think I will per chase from them again after I message them asking for my order to indeed be new!</li>
            <li>And smooth it on at any time when the ends of my hair feel dry.</li>
            <li>For dry hair, we use it to smooth our frizzies a bit.</li>
            <li>- I use it before I blow dry, after I style, to smooth flyways with up</li>
            <li>Definitely smooths our thick wavy hair, and smells great.</li>
            <li>However when I expect it to be new, I want new.</li>
            <li>and im very sensitive to smells</li>
            <li>Makes my hair so silky soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>It did allow me to finally start leaving my hair down again, and I love it for that.</li>
            <li>I put this on right after applying heat (blow dry or iron) and this stuff smooths and shines without making my hair feel loaded with product.</li>
            <li>Before i wouldhave to use gel that leaves it sticky or oils that way it down and made it not look clean.</li>
            <li>Its not too stiff and my hair is fine and curley.</li>
            <li>so much cheaper than buying in stores, same product!</li>
            <li>but I was surprised to find that this after party had been used.</li>
            <li>Completely covers up the frizz and leaves my hair looking and feeling soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I still get a bit of frizz, but I&#x27;m giving it five stars anyway because there&#x27;s only so much any product can do.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly/waving/</li>
            <li>It keeps her hair soft and keeps it from knotting up.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper on amazon than local stores.</li>
            <li>After reading all the reviews I wanted to try something for my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>I wish it were also available in a small travel size to comply with airline 3 ounce carry on size</li>
            <li>Only need a little dab to make curly, frizzy hair feel smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>My hair is thick and this made it smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Great bottle, just wish that the product was bigger, it&#x27;s so expensive!</li>
            <li>and I straighten my hair daily (natural wavy/curly/frizz)</li>
            <li>The After is very intriguing, especially when this small group finds out that time has passed w/o them knowing about it.  </li>
            <li>I love Tigi products for my dry curly thick hair.</li>
            <li>Most products I&#x27;ve tried have weighed my hair down and left it limp and greasy-looking.</li>
            <li>After party gives it a healthy look without the weight of other creams - and it doesn&#x27;t take too much (a little goes a long way).</li>
            <li>and then the next day with dry hair and really got the same result.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use to much though because it will make your hair greasy and weighed down.</li>
            <li>used to have completely straight hair, but now it started curling a little bit on the inside.</li>

            <li> I put this on right after applying heat (blow dry or iron) and this stuff smooths and shines without making my hair feel loaded with product.</li>
            <li> Before i wouldhave to use gel that leaves it sticky or oils that way it down and made it not look clean.</li>
            <li> Its not too stiff and my hair is fine and curley.</li>
            <li> so much cheaper than buying in stores, same product!</li>
            <li> but I was surprised to find that this after party had been used.</li>
            <li> Completely covers up the frizz and leaves my hair looking and feeling soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I still get a bit of frizz, but I&#x27;m giving it five stars anyway because there&#x27;s only so much any product can do.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly/waving/</li>
            <li> It keeps her hair soft and keeps it from knotting up.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper on amazon than local stores.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews I wanted to try something for my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I wish it were also available in a small travel size to comply with airline 3 ounce carry on size</li>
            <li> Only need a little dab to make curly, frizzy hair feel smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and this made it smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Great bottle, just wish that the product was bigger, it&#x27;s so expensive!</li>
            <li> and I straighten my hair daily (natural wavy/curly/frizz)</li>
            <li> The After is very intriguing, especially when this small group finds out that time has passed w/o them knowing about it.  </li>
            <li> I love Tigi products for my dry curly thick hair.</li>
            <li> Most products I&#x27;ve tried have weighed my hair down and left it limp and greasy-looking.</li>
            <li> After party gives it a healthy look without the weight of other creams - and it doesn&#x27;t take too much (a little goes a long way).</li>
            <li> and then the next day with dry hair and really got the same result.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use to much though because it will make your hair greasy and weighed down.</li>
            <li> used to have completely straight hair, but now it started curling a little bit on the inside.</li>
            <li> if you put too much itll leave it feeling greasy but a little goes a long way !</li>
            <li> then you need to use a lot of product so this won&#x27;t last you very long because it&#x27;s only 3.4 oz.  </li>
            <li> Only use this on your ends for the dry parts.</li>
            <li> it simply was not new &amp; I was told it would be.</li>
            <li> I use a pea-sized amount and it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair and use this after I blow dry.  </li>
            <li> So it lasts long too!</li>
            <li> I use it before I blow dry after shampooing my hair.</li>
            <li> seriously, it&#x27;s the real deal at a fraction of the price from a salon.</li>
            <li> Also works on dry hair, just run a lil thru your ends and frizzies are gone!  </li>
            <li> I use this on my wet hair, then blow dry!  </li>
            <li> I have long hair and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> We use it on wet hair.</li>
            <li> I tried it both with wet hair</li>
            <li> and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long ways!</li>
            <li> item arrived as expected!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try other Bed Head products now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the pricey side (for my tastes), but a little goes a long way, so it lasts</li>
            <li> I have very thick long hair (lower back)</li>
            <li> This is my very first Bed Head purchase, and I&#x27;m so mad</li>
            <li> Does weigh down hair.</li>
            <li> If you have long or thick hair or both</li>
            <li> My hair is course and dry and looks dull after washing.  </li>
            <li> I put a little in my hands and run them through my hair and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> some was missing.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser used this product to tame some of the unruly locks.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too expensive and it only worked a little.</li>
            <li> Seems to me that this product is fake, cause the smell is different than the others I already used.</li>
            <li> I use one small pump on my damp ends before styling</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t pay the $22 at Ulta for it, but at least I could have returned it easier.</li>
            <li> along with that creepy, alien-type man.  </li>
            <li> so I was afraid It would make that worse</li>
            <li> An expensive disappointment.</li>
            <li> My hair was still frizzy after using it, but not as bad before using.</li>
            <li> I hate having to rewash it every day</li>
            <li> Smelled horrific.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great price, fast delivery</li>
            <li> This product smells good, but that is about it. It&#x27;s too expensive and it only worked a little. My hair was still frizzy after using it, but not as bad before using. Also this product is greasy. If you have long or thick hair or both then you need to use a lot of product so this won&#x27;t last you very long because it&#x27;s only 3.4 oz.  I will be returning this.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Keeps my ends hydrated and shiny without making my roots greasy. I use a pea-sized amount and it goes a long way. A must-have!</li>
            <li> Smelled horrific. I wanted to  wash my hair immediately to get the stink out. One try and I threw the entire can in the trash.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it really helps smooth without being too heavy.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. makes my hair soft and smooth. I use it before I blow dry after shampooing my hair. And smooth it on at any time when the ends of my hair feel dry.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t. Be without it......</li>
            <li> I love it üòç Great quality</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Makes hair look healthy and very manageable üòä</li>
            <li> Great Seller, great price and fast shipping...5 Stars all the way!</li>
            <li> This product does everything it says it will do.  Will certainly repurchase..</li>
            <li> just as described! so much cheaper than buying in stores, same product!</li>
            <li> This has helped my ends immensely. I will be buying this product again; that is, if it ever runs out. A little bit goes a long ways! Only use this on your ends for the dry parts.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t noticed a difference. Thankful I didn&#x27;t pay the $22 at Ulta for it, but at least I could have returned it easier.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Love bed head</li>
            <li> Fast shipping but I was surprised to find that this after party had been used. It had serum around the cap when I opened it. Not to much was missing. However when I expect it to be new, I want new. It&#x27;s worth 3 stars tho bc it&#x27;s a lot cheaper even tho some was missing. I had to give it 2 stars bc it simply was not new &amp; I was told it would be. But I think I will per chase from them again after I message them asking for my order to indeed be new!</li>
            <li> Great product and a good price</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair and use this after I blow dry.  It smells great and is very good at smoothing.</li>
            <li> Makes hair smooth, more silky &amp; less flyaway. I wish it were also available in a small travel size to comply with airline 3 ounce carry on size</li>
            <li> I use this on my wet hair, then blow dry!  It is absolutley amazing when you use it like that!  Also works on dry hair, just run a lil thru your ends and frizzies are gone!  Godd stuff!!  Smells great too!</li>
            <li> I love this smoothing cream. Completely covers up the frizz and leaves my hair looking and feeling soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Best stuff! Its not too stiff and my hair is fine and curley.</li>
            <li> loved this product feels very light on my hair and make it shin and frizz free am buying another one</li>
            <li> Great product!! Would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> It is what it is. Bed head hair stuff.&lt;br /&gt;No seriously, it&#x27;s the real deal at a fraction of the price from a salon. What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> My hair is the perfect storm of fine and frizzy (and ever since a severe illness a few years back, it&#x27;s thinner than it once was). Most products I&#x27;ve tried have weighed my hair down and left it limp and greasy-looking. I had given up and resigned myself to living in ponytails until my fellow fine-haired friend introduced me to this wonderful substance. It smells great and leaves my hair soft, shiny, and smooth, instead of flat and dirty-looking, like most products. It&#x27;s a little on the pricey side (for my tastes), but a little goes a long way, so it lasts forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On really humid days I still get a bit of frizz, but I&#x27;m giving it five stars anyway because there&#x27;s only so much any product can do. It&#x27;s hair cream, not sorcery. It did allow me to finally start leaving my hair down again, and I love it for that.</li>
            <li> I have very thick long hair (lower back) and I straighten my hair daily (natural wavy/curly/frizz) after I straighten my hair I put a little in my hands and run them through my hair and it works wonders. Super soft and really helps fight frizz. I use this every day!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and love the fly away control and how soft it makes my hair (it also helps detaingle).&lt;br /&gt;A bottle will last me several months with daily use.</li>
            <li> Best product for controlling frizz and you can&#x27;t beat the price here.</li>
            <li> Love this product third time to order!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Tames those fly aways and smells great.</li>
            <li> Probably the hundreth bottle we&#x27;ve purchased. We use it on wet hair. Definitely smooths our thick wavy hair, and smells great. For dry hair, we use it to smooth our frizzies a bit. It gives a nice shine too.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Been using it for years. Much cheaper to buy from Amazon than in store</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly/waving/what is it even doing hair and the After Party Cream totally tames and smooths my hair down to a manageable and gorgeous wave. It came in on time and was packaged great! There was even a few free perfume samples and coupons in it :)</li>
            <li> I love this Tigi, I use it for many years, it&#x27;s great for frizz.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t liked the smell. Seems to me that this product is fake, cause the smell is different than the others I already used.</li>
            <li> Great bottle, just wish that the product was bigger, it&#x27;s so expensive!</li>
            <li> item arrived as expected!</li>
            <li> I love this product - I buy it in bulk - I use it before I blow dry, after I style, to smooth flyways with up do&#x27;s, to smooth my hair when I don&#x27;t have time to wash it - it truly is a miracle product and probably my have bathroom candy!</li>
            <li> Nice product. Does weigh down hair. One of the better products to help lay down those &amp;#34;new growth&amp;#34; fly aways</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 10 years now, since high school, and I have yet to finder a better product to make my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> We are repeat buyers so it must work well.</li>
            <li> This stuff works amazing! I love this product!</li>
            <li> I have curly wavy hair. Its just a frizz ball. Well i tried this product im amazed it is like nothing else love this product.im wearing my hair down and able torun my fingers through it. Before i wouldhave to use gel that leaves it sticky or oils that way it down and made it not look clean. I cant wait to try more of there products. Also it smells great and im very sensitive to smells</li>
            <li> Love this stuff smells great and after applying it your hair feels so smooth</li>
            <li> I put this on right after applying heat (blow dry or iron) and this stuff smooths and shines without making my hair feel loaded with product. I have a pixie cut and my daughter has waist length hair, we both use it and are very happy with the results. Also, second day hair isn&#x27;t gunky like some products can make it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live with out this for my curls!! It is fantastic if you have curly hair and want it to look smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product, makes hair very smooth and smells great!  Works for hours and is a great pick me up for your hair.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff...great for that &amp;#34;I just woke up and my hair is all over the place needing calmed the heck down&amp;#34;...and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing hair care product I have ever used. I am not exaggurating! It states that it is a smoothing cream for frizzy hair but it&#x27;s so much more. My damaged hair is shinier and fluffier than it has ever been! And my hair isn&#x27;t left sticky. I would never even be able to tell there was product in it. Bonus, I dont even have to wipe my hands after applying it. No yucky residue. You have to try it!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Only need a little dab to make curly, frizzy hair feel smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> It smells very good, and makes your hair really healthy, and shiny looking. Don&#x27;t use to much though because it will make your hair greasy and weighed down. I have long hair and a little goes a long way. I recommend.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff. It keeps her hair soft and keeps it from knotting up. The price was so good I bought 2 bottles for her.</li>
            <li> A stylist used this on my hair years ago and I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to pay $20+ for this product. I&#x27;ve been getting it on Amazon and it is still just as amazing!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Makes my hair so silky soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve seen anything on Amazon Originals.  The After is very intriguing, especially when this small group finds out that time has passed w/o them knowing about it.  Then you find out they all have the same birthday...along with that creepy, alien-type man.  Would like to see more.</li>
            <li> Used for a couple years now as a protectant for my ends. I straighten my hair everyday and this stuff is great. I am a greasy Italian so I was afraid It would make that worse but it didn&#x27;t. I use one small pump on my damp ends before styling</li>
            <li> This was supposed to be a spot-on substitute for Sebastian¬¥s &amp;#34;Molding Mud&amp;#34;.  This product is nothing like Mud. Too gooey for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> My wife and I use this product daily to control our hair issues. Great to control frizz and get control of your hair.</li>
            <li> This is top shelf stuff!!! I love Tigi products for my dry curly thick hair. This really tames the poof and makes it silky and more easy to control and shape. Curls rock is great as well!!!</li>
            <li> this stuff is the BEST . im always looking for something to put in my hair after i straighten it that also makes it smell good and this is a must have . its got a silky feel to it. if you put too much itll leave it feeling greasy but a little goes a long way ! the smell is amazing. i would recommend. i will be buying more !</li>
            <li> Great seller, the item arrived very fast.&lt;br /&gt;For the ones who haven&#x27;t tried it, it&#x27;s an amazing product - it smells divine and makes your hair super soft instantly!&lt;br /&gt;I used to have completely straight hair, but now it started curling a little bit on the inside. However, I use this product right after blow drying my hair and it helps it stay straight.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair with a silky finish!! Smells amazing. Dont use too much, or this will make your hair greasy.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping......daughter loves it!</li>
            <li> This was my favorite hair product when my hair was long; it made it glossy and smooth.  Now that my hair is shorter, it just makes it greasy looking.  An expensive disappointment.</li>
            <li> great in wet or dry hair, if you have kids with tatty hair, it works wonders after shower in damp hair!</li>
            <li> I have very curly sometimes unruly hair.  My hair dresser used this product to tame some of the unruly locks.  I loved the fragrance and it helped control some of the frizz.  Amusing bottle...actually says you need a sense of humor...true.</li>
            <li> This is my very first Bed Head purchase, and I&#x27;m so mad I didn&#x27;t try this sooner! My hair is thick and this made it smooth and soft. I can&#x27;t stop running my fingers through my hair! I&#x27;m going to try other Bed Head products now. Much cheaper on amazon than local stores.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t have a need for this like i thought.  It wasn&#x27;t really for my hair.  But might be great for someone else.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews I wanted to try something for my naturally curly hair. I hate having to rewash it every day so thought just would help for the day after. While it does smooth out the frizz pretty good it doesn&#x27;t do anything for the overall texture or add any softness. I tried it both with wet hair and then the next day with dry hair and really got the same result. I say it&#x27;s okay for a general quick fix but just not as well as I expected.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before.  It keeps my hair from getting too frizzy ... most of the time.  However, a bit greasy.</li>
            <li> I have used After Party for years.  My hair is course and dry and looks dull after washing.  After party gives it a healthy look without the weight of other creams - and it doesn&#x27;t take too much (a little goes a long way).</li>
            <li> Moist but not oily. Perfect!</li>
            <li> Great stuff for your hair. It keeps hair health</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. In fact, this is my all time favorite hair product! Never ever leave the house without putting a bit in your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have wavy, but pouf hair. This makes my hair look silky, smooth, and SOFT! And you only need a tiny bit, like pea size. You can put too much! So it lasts long too!</li>
            <li> This works great for taming fly-aways and frizz without making your hair look oily.</li>
