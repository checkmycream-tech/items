            <li>Audrey Hepburn, we love you!</li>
            <li>Not as bright as I&#x27;d hoped, but more of a mint.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this to everyone wanting the popular color.</li>
            <li>It has great lasting power, and the polish is the perfect consistency.</li>
            <li>I am over the moon satisfied! :)</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>However this color, even though it&#x27;s light, looks amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for the perfect blue and this was it!</li>
            <li>For Audrey is a perfect Tiffany &amp; CO blue...</li>
            <li>it looks fantastic with whites, blacks, silvers, or just on its own.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great service.</li>
            <li>Amazing color, gonna be my new favorite for sure.</li>
            <li>Received very quickly also.</li>
            <li>The color is bright and cheery, and a nice thick polish that goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>So happy to have this Tiffany blue.</li>
            <li>Still worth it though!</li>
            <li>Thanks again! :)</li>
            <li>I thought it was going to come as shown just like a bright blue Tiffanys Box.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy and have bought other colors of china glaze.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li>It is really pretty!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good solid, forgiving, true color that gives a professional glaze to it.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Purchased for my bridesmaids and will match their dresses and my wedding color very well.</li>
            <li>Also shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>It also lends itself to nail art very well.</li>
            <li>Shipping was normal.</li>
            <li>, I thought it had a little mint color to it, but it looks almost like the bohemain color, the bohemain is more close to a sky blue.</li>
            <li>If you put it on correctly with a good base and top coat, then it will last the entire week without chipping.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I had expected.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> So happy to have this Tiffany blue. It&#x27;s a little lighter in the bottle. Hoping when I apply it dries a little darker. Shipping was normal. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to come as shown just like a bright blue Tiffanys Box. But it definately did not come that way. Its like a dingy sky blue color. Should have bought something else.</li>
            <li> Love it A All Time fav</li>
            <li> Just as expected. Purchased for my bridesmaids and will match their dresses and my wedding color very well.</li>

However this color, even though it&#x27;s light, looks amazing. It&#x27;s a good solid, forgiving, true color that gives a professional glaze to it. Like I said, staying power not impressed but my nails are pretty bad off now. Good color, good quality. I&#x27;m happy and have bought other colors of china glaze. Received very quickly also.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color! Doesn&#x27;t get watery. But it does chip &#x3D;( Still worth it though!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I had expected. The color is bright and cheery, and a nice thick polish that goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this nail polish! It is really pretty! I recommend this to everyone wanting the popular color. Also shipping was fast.</li>

            <li> I LOVE CHINA GLAZE!! But this color doesn&#x27;t look like the color in the picture, I thought it had a little mint color to it, but it looks almost like the bohemain color, the bohemain is more close to a sky blue. Other then this purchase I&#x27;ve been very happy with china glaze, I was always a OPI girl, no more!!! 😸I&#x27;m a china glaze girl all the way now!!!  I&#x27;m going to take a picture of the 2 bottles side by side. The Audrey and bohemain, so people can see the difference or maybe not see a difference.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping! Beautiful color! Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Not as bright as I&#x27;d hoped, but more of a mint.  Not aqua, maybe I got an off color bottle?.  :(  Still, I adore China Glaze!</li>
            <li> China Glaze is the best polish I&#x27;ve ever tried. It has great lasting power, and the polish is the perfect consistency. If you put it on correctly with a good base and top coat, then it will last the entire week without chipping. It also lends itself to nail art very well. For Audrey is a perfect Tiffany &amp; CO blue... it looks fantastic with whites, blacks, silvers, or just on its own. Love it!</li>
            <li> Perfect toenail color for Summer! ❤️❤️❤️</li>
            <li> Beauty color, appears to be a pinch on the green side than Tiffany Blue. Can&#x27;t wait to wear!</li>
            <li> This is the color of the box you&#x27;ll get from Tiffany&#x27;s with your big diamond ring inside. Or maybe paint your toenails this color and put a tiny white bow on the big piggies. Audrey Hepburn, we love you!</li>
            <li> Loved it! Came in perfect condition. The color is amazing! I definitely recommend this polish for evryone!!! Thanks again! :)</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it ! Thanks for the great service. I look forward to doing business again. the selection is great ! have a great day !</li>
