            <li>It also does not smell very great.</li>
            <li>Love it!!!!</li>
            <li>The best shampoo&lt;br /&gt;volumed</li>
            <li>I purchased two bottles of this shampoo and was very happy with the experience.  </li>
            <li>Progaine is an excellent product for those of us who have thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy to say that I can tell a difference in the thickness of my hair after using Progaine.</li>
            <li>I have used this awesome shampoo for MANY years!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had great results.</li>
            <li>it IS the best shampoo for fine, lifeless hair like mine.  </li>
            <li>Good volumizing shampoo.  </li>

            <li>After reading good reviews, I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for that perfect shampoo because my hair is very fine and thinning on top.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;ll just have to find something else for his very fine hair!</li>
            <li>I have used it for years and have been very satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li>I liked this shampoo and I purchased it because I was using Rogaine for my hair loss.</li>
            <li>Quite honestly this was the absolute best Hair Regrowth Products I had ever tried.</li>
            <li>Without this product I don&#x27;t think Rogaine would work effectively.  </li>
            <li>Glad we could order it at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>Now only if it adds hair growing ingredients to it, then it would be perfect.</li>
            <li>Not to mention that it is now approx 100x more than what I used to pay at CVS about 6-8 months ago.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice to convince them to make it available again.</li>
            <li>but we needed it glad u had it</li>
            <li>Still have the silky hair I love but also have the added thickness.</li>

            <li>/&gt;Great product, just don&#x27;t pay more than $7 for it....</li>
            <li>I ordered this as a companion product to Rogaine itself and it seems like a nice, mild shampoo.  </li>
            <li>My hair is clean after this shampoo!</li>
            <li>You get that whistle clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Then I can keep my hair clean every day.</li>
            <li>This is the best product we&#x27;ve found and it&#x27;s hard to find in retail stores.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to be as kind as possible to my hair</li>
            <li>Decided it wasn&#x27;t worth it and trashed it.</li>
            <li>Nothing has been able to produce the same results since they discontinued it.</li>

            <li>thanks so much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very helpful to my hair.</li>
            <li>no complaints thats really all i have to say</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great shampoo for folks with thin or thinning hair but</li>
            <li>Is there hidden GOLD, or precious jewels inside the bottle now?  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sad that such an awesome product is now so untouchable...</li>
            <li>Although I am not using it anymore, for its high price.</li>
            <li>The price is too high.</li>
            <li>100x more than what i was paying less than a yr ago?!?  </li>
            <li>It creates a very rich lather and doesn&#x27;t seem too harsh.</li>

            <li>Given what folks have been willing to pay I was briefly tempted to put together a group to purchase the formula.  </li>
            <li>How much money could it possibly take to make it, all of a sudden??  </li>
            <li>My hair has thinned out over the last 2 years due to an autoimmune disorder and the progaine shampoo, along with the other progaine products has helped give my hair more volume.</li>
            <li>I am 56 yrs old, and I have NEVER seen a price increase like this on something as simple as SHAMPOO in my entire life!  </li>
            <li>Yikes just what someone with thin fine hair doesn&#x27;t need.  </li>

            <li> I ordered this as a companion product to Rogaine itself and it seems like a nice, mild shampoo.  I&#x27;m trying to be as kind as possible to my hair and hopefully this helps.</li>
            <li> Not sure what this shampoo really does for your hair. It also does not smell very great. would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell . this is a hair growth product which will take months or years to fully get answers. It cleans well but growth hasn&#x27;t started yet.</li>
            <li> This is the best product we&#x27;ve found and it&#x27;s hard to find in retail stores.  Glad we could order it at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Good volumizing shampoo.  Now only if it adds hair growing ingredients to it, then it would be perfect.</li>

            <li> My husband loves this shampoo but it no longer is being made.  He&#x27;ll just have to find something else for his very fine hair!</li>
            <li> This product helps give my hair a thicker look and I am please with it  Certainly will purchase it again</li>
            <li> My hair is clean after this shampoo! You get that whistle clean feeling. You don&#x27;t have to worry about any residue left on the hair. I use this with the Thicker Fuller Hair root lift. Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> The best shampoo&lt;br /&gt;volumed your hair&lt;br /&gt;great smell!&lt;br /&gt;I really recommeded&lt;br /&gt;I really recommeded&lt;br /&gt;I reI rI really recommededeally recommededally recommeded</li>
            <li> I have used this awesome shampoo for MANY years!  BUT, what has happened to the RIDICULOUS price??  Is there hidden GOLD, or precious jewels inside the bottle now?  I used to pay about $8 or $9 a bottle at CVS...and NOW, it can cost up to $599 for 6 bottles?!?!?  How is that even possible?  In February, I went ahead and paid what i THOUGHT was way too much..and i bought 3 bottles for $65.  But, now that I&#x27;m on my last bottle, I&#x27;ve gone online and found out that it has increased AGAIN, just since February!  Not to mention that it is now approx 100x more than what I used to pay at CVS about 6-8 months ago.  I wouldn&#x27;t even be wasting my time commenting, except (unfortunately) it IS the best shampoo for fine, lifeless hair like mine.  I have TRIED to find a comparable product by purchasing Redken, Matrix, Paul Mitchell, etc... and have wasted way too much money trying to REPLACE Progaine.  I just wonder if there are still people buying this product...even at this insane price!  I will continue to try to find a shampoo that I can switch to... It&#x27;s sad that such an awesome product is now so untouchable...and it&#x27;s JUST SHAMPOO, for goodness sake!!  How much money could it possibly take to make it, all of a sudden??  And, WHY all of a sudden did it just sky rocket, out of nowhere???  I am 56 yrs old, and I have NEVER seen a price increase like this on something as simple as SHAMPOO in my entire life!  Cars and real estate don&#x27;t even experience this type of increase....100x more than what i was paying less than a yr ago?!?  Sad...</li>
            <li> good shampoo but doesn&#x27;t help grow hair! Not worth the money. I used it because I bought it but was not impressed.</li>
            <li> This product works well as a volumizing shampoo. However, the price as compared to when it was sold in drug stores has risen to outrageous levels.</li>
            <li> I purchased two bottles of this shampoo and was very happy with the experience.  The order arrived in a timely manner and I would do business with the seller again.  Progaine is an excellent product for those of us who have thinning hair.  I have used it for years and have been very satisfied with the product.  Unfortunately, I understand that it is not available anymore and I urge others  who have used this product to complain to the  manufacturer as I intend to do.  It would be nice to convince them to make it available again.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does what it is advertised to do, volumizing and leaving hair very soft.  The price is too high.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s that expensive but we needed it glad u had it thanks so much</li>
            <li> Quite honestly this was the absolute best Hair Regrowth Products I had ever tried. Nothing has been able to produce the same results since they discontinued it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple months now and I&#x27;ve had great results. I use this shampoo in the mornings along with the Nioxin hairspray. Keep in mind, this product doesn&#x27;t help with hair regrowth, but just to volumize it. I would say use Nioxin products to help with hair regrowth and re-strengthening.</li>
            <li> The products I rated have been opened and tried and worked well.  I haven&#x27;t opened the other products purchased as they are Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> It is very good; however, too expensive.  I used to purchase it at CVS, but it no longer carries it.  It cost much less than $65.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very helpful to my hair. I use it every day. Then I can keep my hair clean every day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel this product added volume to my hair and it seemed to dry out my hair making it a bugger to comb/brush out my hair after washing it so that I pulled out a lot of hair trying to get all the knots out.  Yikes just what someone with thin fine hair doesn&#x27;t need.  I had to use double the amount of cream rinse to counteract the effect of this shampoo.  Decided it wasn&#x27;t worth it and trashed it.</li>
            <li> no complaints thats really all i have to say and now im writing to fill up the words required. there!</li>
            <li> Thickens thin hair like mine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for that perfect shampoo because my hair is very fine and thinning on top. After reading good reviews, I decided to try it. I&#x27;m very happy to say that I can tell a difference in the thickness of my hair after using Progaine. I shampoo my hair every other day with Progaine and use a light conditioner each time. Still have the silky hair I love but also have the added thickness.</li>
            <li> I just purchased my last Progaine Shampoo.  It&#x27;s a great shampoo for folks with thin or thinning hair but what was once $8 for 12 ounces is now $80 because the manufacturer stopped making it.  If you want it, Amazon and other online sites are where to get it.  You won&#x27;t find it in stores.  Given what folks have been willing to pay I was briefly tempted to put together a group to purchase the formula.  Maybe some one else will.  Otherwise, say goodbye to Progaine.</li>
            <li> Must use if you use Rogaine treatment. Without this product I don&#x27;t think Rogaine would work effectively.  Moreover It makes my hair regrowth again and feels like a balsam.</li>
            <li> I found this shampoo on amazon last year. I like it quite a bit. It creates a very rich lather and doesn&#x27;t seem too harsh. As for its hair restorative qualities, well it has none. But as far as shampoos go, I think it is more beneficial to thinning hair than your everyday shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;m not sure what happened, but about 6 months ago this went from $6 a bottle to about $20 a bottle on amazon. Doing a simple web search I found that just about ever vendor of this shampoo on the web did the same price hike. The single vendor that didn&#x27;t was CVS. This isn&#x27;t a CVS plug (except for being able to buy Progaine I couldn&#x27;t care less about CVS), do a web search and look for yourself. They usually have some sort of 15-25% off promo code (found elsewhere online) that can be applied to your order aswell. I just ordered 9 bottles of Prograine with shipping included for $52.34. I just wanted to pass this tidbit of information along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, just don&#x27;t pay more than $7 for it.... it is only shampoo after all.</li>
            <li> The Shampoo arrived with the top open and much of the contents spilled out.&lt;br /&gt;And sadly, I did not realize upon purchasing the shampoo that I was paying three times the price other vendors were offering for the same product.&lt;br /&gt;Best.  Frank</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo I have used for years that makes my fine hair have volume.  Unfortunately it is no longer being produced thus the ridiculous prices. As I try my third brand without success the price gets less and less ridiculous because I want my old hair back!! If anyone finds a comparable shampoo please post.</li>
