            <li>The scent is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t any kind of bronzer or color enhancers.</li>
            <li>Would be great for a man, not so much for a woman....</li>
            <li>ok, I would purchase it again from this seller.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know too many men who have cellulite</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more in that my tanning salon doesn&#x27;t carry it.</li>
            <li>This lotion is okay.</li>
            <li>It definitely smells better on him than me!!!</li>
            <li>This is a good lotion for the first time tanner.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m super picky about how a tanning lotion smells and this one is amazing.</li>
            <li>This tanning lotion smells great for men and leaves your skin soft!</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell incredible, it hides the smell of burning skin.</li>
            <li>The product in this bottle does not smell as strong and does not moisturize like the salon purchased product did.</li>
            <li>This product shipped quickly and is authentic...</li>
            <li>And i got a free sample packet too..</li>
            <li>Most often I use it AFTER I tan as a smell good moisutrizer and not as an actual tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>This is the first lotion I ever used, and I fell in love.</li>
            <li>I have a real nice dark natural looking tan...!!</li>
            <li>the aroma is very much like cologne..</li>
            <li>The fragrance is the first thing I notice about it.</li>
            <li>However it won&#x27;t give you the extremely dark tan that more advanced lotions will.</li>
            <li>Funny smell and leaves residue on clothing</li>
            <li>This was the first tanning lotion I ever tried</li>
            <li>so I was certain this would be a feminine scent.</li>
            <li>I really like the way this product smells.</li>
            <li>I really like</li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t looking for what I bought.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s for sure a Level 1 as stated on the back and had I known that prior to buying probably wouldn&#x27;t have purchased.</li>
            <li>It goes on silky smooth and after tanning, my skin felt more firm and tight.</li>
            <li>great lotion for the beginning tanner or someone who doesn&#x27;t want to look too artificial.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting some color slowly but surely.</li>
            <li>This leaves me wondering if this item is the same stuff or maybe just very old.</li>

            <li> It sells out fast at tanning salons and half the price on Amazon!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s EXACTLY the same product the salon offered but less than half the price.</li>
            <li> and I got much darker than with some of the salon lotions I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> The bottle is the same as the other with the same stamping on the bottom and identical label as the other.</li>

            <li> Always as expected and arrived on time</li>
            <li> It smells like Abercrombie Fierce, not the typical fruity smell of other lotions.</li>
            <li> I wish they would make a dark bronzer with this scent.</li>
            <li> It worked really well and was much less expensive than buying it at the tanning salon - so would order it again.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product in the past retail from a salon.</li>
            <li> Smells like an expensive men&#x27;s designer fragrance - Chanel Allure Homme Edition Blanche.  </li>
            <li> You can run errands after the tanning bed and not have that awkward tanning bed smell on your skin.</li>
            <li> so it does not have that nasty odor that alot of Tanning products do.</li>

            <li> This product has a really strong manly smell!! Would be great for a man, not so much for a woman....</li>
            <li> Great product. . And i got a free sample packet too..</li>
            <li> I really like the way this product smells. It doesn&#x27;t give you that burning tanning smell and you can&#x27;t bit the price</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product in the past retail from a salon. The product in this bottle does not smell as strong and does not moisturize like the salon purchased product did. The bottle is the same as the other with the same stamping on the bottom and identical label as the other. This leaves me wondering if this item is the same stuff or maybe just very old. The product was advertised as \\&quot;new\\&quot;.  I did save about 50% over the salon cost though and finding that this product from this seller did work ok, I would purchase it again from this seller.</li>
            <li> I was all fired up to order this product because of the ingredients that helped with cellulite. What the bottle, nor any of the information about it, mentioned that it had a very heavy masculine scent. It almost smelled like an aftershave or cologne and would have smelled great on a guy. I don&#x27;t know too many men who have cellulite so I was certain this would be a feminine scent. The bottle I received made the tanning salon worker take notice to how \\&quot;cologney\\&quot; it smelled. I ended up giving this bottle to my friends son who is a lifeguard this summer. It definitely smells better on him than me!!!</li>
            <li> The fragrance is the first thing I notice about it. It&#x27;s like a man&#x27;s body spray: kind of spicy but in a good way. It goes on silky smooth and after tanning, my skin felt more firm and tight. There isn&#x27;t an after tan smell that I can tell but that may be because of the spicy scent. I like this lotion and I got much darker than with some of the salon lotions I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Smells like an expensive men&#x27;s designer fragrance - Chanel Allure Homme Edition Blanche.  Great for guys.  Doesn&#x27;t have bronzer so your clothes won&#x27;t stain afterwards.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected it to be</li>
            <li> From someone who had never been tanning before this product does work. It smells good too! I&#x27;m getting some color slowly but surely.</li>
            <li> Always as expected and arrived on time</li>
            <li> It goes on real smooth I really like it.!!&lt;br /&gt;And it smells good to..!!!&lt;br /&gt;And I have a real nice dark natural looking tan...!!</li>
            <li> Moda Milano is perfect for beginners! Not only does it smell incredible, it hides the smell of burning skin. It makes your skin feel like silk. This is the first lotion I ever used, and I fell in love. The scent has been compared to Abercrombie Fierce cologne. Lather on, relax and tan!</li>
            <li> It worked really well and was much less expensive than buying it at the tanning salon - so would order it again.</li>
            <li> This is a good lotion for the first time tanner. There is no bronzer in it, so it&#x27;s good for beginners. However it won&#x27;t give you the extremely dark tan that more advanced lotions will. The scent is absolutely amazing. It smells like Abercrombie Fierce, not the typical fruity smell of other lotions. I wish they would make a dark bronzer with this scent.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion smells great for men and leaves your skin soft! It sells out fast at tanning salons and half the price on Amazon!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m super picky about how a tanning lotion smells and this one is amazing. It reminds me of my husbands colonge. You can run errands after the tanning bed and not have that awkward tanning bed smell on your skin. The downside of this and the reason it only got 3 *** from me is, it&#x27;s just a lotion. There isn&#x27;t any kind of bronzer or color enhancers. JUST smell..... it&#x27;s for sure a Level 1 as stated on the back and had I known that prior to buying probably wouldn&#x27;t have purchased. I really wasn&#x27;t looking for what I bought. Most often I use it AFTER I tan as a smell good moisutrizer and not as an actual tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> Smells great and gives a great result,it has no bronzer so it does not have that nasty odor that alot of Tanning products do.</li>

            <li> This product shipped quickly and is authentic... the aroma is very much like cologne.. I would suggest it for a man&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> This was the first tanning lotion I ever tried and I&#x27;ve found myself always going back to it.  It has a great smell, no bronzers, and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky after use.  Plus you can&#x27;t beat the price for it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> This lotion is okay. It smells like men&#x27;s axe, and it isn&#x27;t as thick as a normal lotion. It was alright.</li>
