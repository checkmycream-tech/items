    <ol>
            <li>it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>The best of all, I stopped wasting my money in Rx products that did not help.</li>
            <li>This has a very pleasant fruity smell.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is a great.</li>
            <li>Great lather and scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am very happy with this shampoo and the available matching conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise good price and delivered timely.</li>
            <li>but it does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Besides that, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>Even though I do not have color-treated hair, I&#x27;ve enjoyed this shampoo!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m super pleased and proud of the proud, the ingredients, the results and the price.</li>
            <li>and because I sniffed it in the store and liked the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used their hemp shampoo problem-free, and it was so effective that I didn&#x27;t have to use conditioner.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, seems to do a good job of cleaning our hair.</li>
            <li>shampoo comes in a sturdy plastic bottle with flip-open screw-on cap, suitable for travel.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo has a great scent and lasts pretty well throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It smells nice while you wash your hair, but doesn&#x27;t leave a strong scent after the shampoo.</li>
            <li>This smells nothing like a pomegranate or sunflower for one, more like bubble gum.  </li>
            <li>It also contains a lot more extracts.</li>
            <li>Again, this stuff smells awesome, too, especially if you like fruity scents.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It is nice that it is free from harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>While this shampoo smells great, and is indeed SLS-free, it&#x27;s very drying, and strips the dye color from my hair.</li>
            <li>We have course hair and have always needed the conditioner to make the hair more manageable.  </li>
            <li>Who could ask for anything more?</li>
            <li>Love organic products.</li>
            <li>Ok  </li>
            <li>I tried many products to get rid of the bumps in my scalp and nothing helped.</li>
            <li>me a lot of: Smooth, Shine, Moisture, Etc.</li>
            <li>This shampoo works fantastic as a duo purpose.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair light, clean and feeling airy.</li>
            <li>After a month of using it my scalp started to clear up and after some months more I am a person with a healthy and itchy-free scalp.</li>
            <li>The container isn&#x27;t large; It&#x27;s easy to handle in the shower, and keeps the bathroom clutter free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also mild so you can use it every day.</li>
            <li>This shampoo leaves you with light, soft, lovely smelling hair.</li>
            <li>My hair also does not seem to become greasy as quickly like it does with mainstream shampoos.</li>
            <li>I took a leap of faith with this product after I purchased the shampoo and conditioner from a local Publix (mostly because it smells fantastic).</li>
            <li>A volumizing hair care product should fix the flatness problem--I&#x27;ll gladly trade a fixable lack of volume for soft and silky hair.</li>
            <li>I bought it because I have used other Nature&#x27;s Gate products with no problem and thought that this particular one for color enhanced hair would be great, but it is not up to my standards by any means.  </li>
            <li>shampoo should be advertised better, so people that do not truly pay attention if the product is &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or not could know that there might be a direct benefit of choosing products without certain chemicals.</li>
            <li>(My hair is light natural blond with some platinum streaks.  </li>
            <li>The label states it is formulated with pomegranate and red tea leaf for their antioxidant benefits and sunflower and grapeseed extracts to help prevent color fade, making hair look brighter and more lustrous.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I will buy anything online that I haven&#x27;t smelled in person first.  </li>
            <li>haha!</li>
            <li>I has been many years wondering why I had such an itchy and problematic scalp.</li>
            <li>I use this shampoo on my chemically treated hair and it leaves it clean, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>This has a light scent (not strong at all-which I love) and yet protects my hair color.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this five stars is that my hair is a little flatter than before, and you need to use a liberal amount for a good cleaning.</li>
            <li>It cleans decently.  </li>
            <li>Apparently I am sensitive to them and this shampoo works very well and it does not have sulfates.</li>
            <li>It further states it is paraben-free, alcohol-free, and is ph-balanced with no artificial color.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the only shampoo that doesn&#x27;t strip out the color right away.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t overdry and the scent is not heavy.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling stripped of all its natural oils when combined with the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s classic and standard.</li>
            <li>My hair is a little dry from using color on it, and this doesn&#x27;t help to make it feel any better.  </li>
            <li>My hair is now very soft and silky, definitely moreso than when I used chemical-laden salon products.</li>
            <li>Sorry to say, not my favorite!</li>
            <li>It left my hair full, soft, fluffy and shiny.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also reasonably priced compared to other natural haircare products.</li>
            <li>Unless you plan on adding your own oil to mitigate the drying effect, I do NOT recommend this, and am rather sorry I bought a multi-pack.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a bottle redhead, and this stuff is definitely stripping the color out, as evidenced by the pink tinted suds.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m going to have to add olive oil to the other 2 bottles when I get to using them.</li>
            <li> It is not as fragrant as other shampoos</li>
            <li> I am so thankful of having found this shampoo because it seems that all my problems were due to the sulfates.</li>
            <li> Because my hair is long and thick, it will tangle a little with any shampoo, but the tangles were minimal and combed out</li>
            <li> I have long, thick Filipino hair</li>
            <li> It is also long and thick.)</li>
            <li> I ordered 6 bottles and two bottle&#x27;s caps loosed up leaking a little of the shampoo over the bottles.  </li>
            <li> Should I be mean to guests and put it in their shower?  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I started using these products when I switched out all my personal care products. Have you read about all the chemicals and fragrances that are endocrine (and hormone) disruptors? This has a light scent (not strong at all-which I love) and yet protects my hair color. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t overdry and the scent is not heavy. It smells nice while you wash your hair, but doesn&#x27;t leave a strong scent after the shampoo. It&#x27;s also mild so you can use it every day. I have been using this for about two years now. It&#x27;s also reasonably priced compared to other natural haircare products.</li>
            <li> This smells nothing like a pomegranate or sunflower for one, more like bubble gum.  It leaves my hair feeling stripped of all its natural oils when combined with the conditioner.  I have to use a ton of both the shampoo and conditioner to make my hair de-tangle because this has no smoothing effect on my hair whatsoever.  I have long, thick Filipino hair so maybe it isn&#x27;t meant for my type.  I bought it because I have used other Nature&#x27;s Gate products with no problem and thought that this particular one for color enhanced hair would be great, but it is not up to my standards by any means.  My hair is a little dry from using color on it, and this doesn&#x27;t help to make it feel any better.  Sorry to say, not my favorite!</li>
            <li> I LOVE it!  I tried it because I like Nature&#x27;s Gate Colloidal Oatmeal Lotion and because I sniffed it in the store and liked the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like fruit scents and hate chemical perfume scents. This has a very pleasant fruity smell.  It left my hair full, soft, fluffy and shiny.  It did not discolor it.  (My hair is light natural blond with some platinum streaks.  It is also long and thick.) I also used the Nature&#x27;s Gate Pomegranate Sunflower conditioner.  Because my hair is long and thick, it will tangle a little with any shampoo, but the tangles were minimal and combed out easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo comes in a sturdy plastic bottle with flip-open screw-on cap, suitable for travel.  The label states it is formulated with pomegranate and red tea leaf for their antioxidant benefits and sunflower and grapeseed extracts to help prevent color fade, making hair look brighter and more lustrous.  It further states it is paraben-free, alcohol-free, and is ph-balanced with no artificial color. It also contains a lot more extracts. It does contain sodium laureth sulfate (which some folks do not like). It states it is produced without animal testing and without animal byproducts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this shampoo and the available matching conditioner.  I like the way it makes my hair look and I get lots of compliments on my hair when I use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years on color treated hair and it&#x27;s the only shampoo that doesn&#x27;t strip out the color right away.</li>
            <li> I took a leap of faith with this product after I purchased the shampoo and conditioner from a local Publix (mostly because it smells fantastic). My hair is now very soft and silky, definitely moreso than when I used chemical-laden salon products. Again, this stuff smells awesome, too, especially if you like fruity scents.

            <li> I was using the Replenishing Shampoo &amp; Conditioner.  I bought this because it was similar &amp; I could buy it in a multi-pack.  Now I&#x27;m hooked.  I love it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves you with light, soft, lovely smelling hair. I&#x27;ve used it for years and I&#x27;m super pleased and proud of the proud, the ingredients, the results and the price.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a great scent and lasts pretty well throughout the day. However, it does leave my hair a little greasier than normal and it takes about a week of using for that to calm down a little. It is nice that it is free from harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SHAMPOO.&lt;br /&gt;I used other shampoo&#x27;s from this brand but NEVER ~ any other Shampoo do to my hair what does the Promegranate Sunflower Hair Defense to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s simple amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Give me a lot of: Smooth, Shine, Moisture, Etc. Etc... I Lov it.</li>
            <li> love this shampoo. it smells wonderful. I would recommend this product to family and friends. I will order this product again.</li>
            <li> It cleans decently.  I don&#x27;t like the smell at all.  I don&#x27;t think I will buy anything online that I haven&#x27;t smelled in person first.  I&#x27;m an idiot. I did a subscribe and save and have a bunch of bottles that I have to use now.  Should I be mean to guests and put it in their shower?  haha!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is a great. It&#x27;s classic and standard.The container isn&#x27;t large; It&#x27;s easy to handle in the shower, and keeps the bathroom clutter free. I would definitely recommended  this shampoo for families and lovers.</li>
            <li> While this shampoo smells great, and is indeed SLS-free, it&#x27;s very drying, and strips the dye color from my hair. I&#x27;m a bottle redhead, and this stuff is definitely stripping the color out, as evidenced by the pink tinted suds. It&#x27;s also extremely drying to my hair. I couldn&#x27;t even finger comb it in the shower after rinsing. I added olive oil to the bottle, and that seems to have helped in not turning my hair in to wet straw, but it&#x27;s certainly not what I expected of a shampoo from Nature&#x27;s Gate. I&#x27;ve used their hemp shampoo problem-free, and it was so effective that I didn&#x27;t have to use conditioner. With this Pomegranate-Sunflower stuff, I NEED conditioner despite the added oil, or my hair is still uncombable. Unless you plan on adding your own oil to mitigate the drying effect, I do NOT recommend this, and am rather sorry I bought a multi-pack. I&#x27;m going to have to add olive oil to the other 2 bottles when I get to using them. After those are gone, I&#x27;m never purchasing this shampoo type again, I&#x27;ll stick to the hemp one.</li>
            <li> Even though I do not have color-treated hair, I&#x27;ve enjoyed this shampoo! It leaves my hair light, clean and feeling airy. My hair also does not seem to become greasy as quickly like it does with mainstream shampoos.</li>
            <li> This product has allowed us to eliminate buying a conditioner for our hair.  We have course hair and have always needed the conditioner to make the hair more manageable.  This shampoo works fantastic as a duo purpose.  We have tried other blends from Nature&#x27;s Gate but this is the only one we have found to work as a duo shampoo/conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it a 4 because of the shipping.  I ordered 6 bottles and two bottle&#x27;s caps loosed up leaking a little of the shampoo over the bottles.  Enough for a couple of hair washes.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, seems to do a good job of cleaning our hair. Who could ask for anything more?</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo on my chemically treated hair and it leaves it clean, soft and shiny. Great lather and scent.</li>
            <li> Love organic products. Thank you for making it possible</li>
            <li> One bottle was open and slightly spilled. Otherwise good price and delivered timely. Should make sure all bottles are twisted shut next time.</li>
            <li> Twenty words I need huh?  Ok  I like this shampoo. My mom recommended it as she said Dr OZ or someone was plugging for it.  It is not as fragrant as other shampoos I like but it does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ill buy it again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I has been many years wondering why I had such an itchy and problematic scalp. I tried many products to get rid of the bumps in my scalp and nothing helped. I am so thankful of having found this shampoo because it seems that all my problems were due to the sulfates. Apparently I am sensitive to them and this shampoo works very well and it does not have sulfates. After a month of using it my scalp started to clear up and after some months more I am a person with a healthy and itchy-free scalp. The best of all, I stopped wasting my money in Rx products that did not help. What can I say? thank you!&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo should be advertised better, so people that do not truly pay attention if the product is &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or not could know that there might be a direct benefit of choosing products without certain chemicals.</li>
