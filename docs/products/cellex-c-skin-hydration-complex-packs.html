            <li> To be precise, I use the professional formula in winter (when the weather is really cold) and the regular formula during the rest of the year.</li>
            <li> my face is still so dry...</li>
            <li> It boosts other moisturizers and is not sticky.  </li>
            <li> seriously turns back the clock!</li>
            <li> The other high dollar crap you buy at department stores don&#x27;t hold a candle to this stuff.</li>
            <li> I use this after vitamin C complex in the morning.  </li>
            <li> but if I ever feel the need to supplement moisture, I use the skin hydration complex also underneath my day or night cream when I don&#x27;t use the c-serum.&lt;br</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re looking for plumpness and moisture you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>

            <li> Great product for skin health.</li>
            <li> I have used this for over 2 years and love it. It makes your skin feel smooth &amp; refreshed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been around forever, but is only withing the past years been touted in so many products.  Here is the pure product and it works beautifully.  I use it after the Serum.  You do need, as directed, a moisturizer following application.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re looking for plumpness and moisture you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product. just add some vitamin C powder to it and you have protection as well</li>
            <li> I&#x60;ve used Hydra 5 serum for years and LOVE it...it REALLY does the job...soooooooooooooooo, I thought...this can only be better, since it says PROFESSIONAL on the bottle.  Save your money ladies, and gents...it doesn&#x60;t hold a candle to the Hydra 5 serum...I&#x60;m switching back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 7 years now and it&#x27;s really great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I use this after vitamin C complex in the morning.  Also use under eyes prior to eye cream. It boosts other moisturizers and is not sticky.  I will repurchase.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, as anyone who has ever used it knows! It delivers as promised and then some. Works best with other recommended products though, especially the vitamin C.</li>
            <li> Very good! Nice price for Germany!</li>
            <li> This and the vitamin c product that goes with it have transformed my skin! I would defiantly use them together. Super results.....seriously turns back the clock!</li>
            <li> this product has saved my face!! Love it. I have used cellex c for 6 years and I can not say enough wonderful things about it.  Just try it and see</li>
            <li> I have used this product off and on for some time, in combination with the Cellex-C Advanced-C Serum.  I&#x27;ve always had good results, so I continue to purchase this product, although feel it is somewhat expensive.</li>
            <li> This, used in conjunction with the Cellex-C Serum has been my daily skin care routine for 9 years. It was recommended by my plastic surgeon and is the only product I spend &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; money on. I love it and I think my skin looks great!</li>
            <li> What is this for???? need a refund.. nothing works out.. my face is still so dry...</li>
            <li> I have used this skin hydration for several years.  It works very well for me.</li>
            <li> I love this skin hydration complex. I have tried a few others, but Cellex-C is really the best. To be precise, I use the professional formula in winter (when the weather is really cold) and the regular formula during the rest of the year. It gets absorbed well by my skin, is scent-free and does not leave any film on my skin. The skin feels perfectly nurtured, and I only need small quantities of the product. So the bottle really lasts for quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this skin hydrator together with the c-serum (also from Cellex-C) once a day, but if I ever feel the need to supplement moisture, I use the skin hydration complex also underneath my day or night cream when I don&#x27;t use the c-serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really rocks!</li>
            <li> Have strayed away, but always seem to come back to Cellex-C.  Yes it is pricey, but it does what it claims.  The other high dollar crap you buy at department stores don&#x27;t hold a candle to this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Been using Cellex-C for years.</li>
