            <li>They love it and it keeps me sane!</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit strong, not too great.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>but effective.</li>
            <li>But, adding the conditioner and then leave-in spray (or gel) brings it to about 100% by (admittedly) their own research.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and feels good on hair...</li>
            <li>It also smells soooooooo nice, even I like using it.  </li>
            <li>Nice herbal scent.  </li>
            <li>(My kids are the kind of kids that need to be bathed every day and get their hair washed every day.)</li>
            <li>It IS nice smelling, quality shampoo.</li>
            <li>I also think it smells nice.</li>
            <li>I do not like the very strong smell.  </li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful and leaves her hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Who knows, but the shampoo cleans nicely, smells pretty good, so why not.</li>
            <li>I also like the detangling spray, again light and nice smell, the kids think it is strong but nice when it dries.</li>
            <li>my daughter is still lice free!  </li>
            <li>and I use this shampoo more for piece of mind.  </li>
            <li>If you have ever been through the horrendous and embarrassing situation of finding lice in your children&#x27;s hair, you know that it is the most frantic work a parent will have to endure (</li>
            <li>It changed my life for the better.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s shoulder length hair always looks lovely.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice and leaves my daughters hair smooth and manageable.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll still use it unless i find something better.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)  </li>
            <li>My girls love the smell of this shampoo and during the Lice scare around school</li>
            <li>This product is just ok.</li>
            <li>They love the way it smells.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s natural and smells good!</li>
            <li>Also, per their own materials, the products must be layered for full effect.  </li>
            <li>If you can afford the products THEY ARE WORTH EVERY PENNY!!</li>
            <li>Anything that keeps lice away is worth it!!</li>
            <li>But, I really do like it and feel good about using it.  </li>
            <li>It smells good and leaves my daughter&#x27;s hair very combable without needing conditioner.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is pleasant enough, it has a nice rosemary/tea tree smell to it that I like, but the kids don&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li>very nice shampoo Makes my daughters hair so soft</li>
            <li>We have successfully completed a full year of daycare without lice thanks to this product.  </li>
            <li>So much so I&#x27;ve started using the product myself just so my hair looks better!  </li>
            <li>Excellent product, easy to use and works as advertised without any harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo, smell is nice and so far no lice !</li>
            <li>I am unsure if the product works because the smell is very strong and my 4 year olds refused to let me wash their hair with it after the first time.</li>
            <li>In fact all Fairy Tales treatment products are fantastic.</li>
            <li>In my opinion they are the premium head lice removal products available.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>Lightly scented.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Used it a couple times smells oretty strong not a bad smell....</li>
            <li>They arrive quickly and are the same great quality as you will get on the manufacturer&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li>assuming that you are a clean person and value cleanliness).</li>
            <li>and she was completely clean.</li>
            <li>nurse always asks my kids if &amp;#34;mommy is still using the special shampoo&amp;#34; when she goes about checking kids for lice.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>They are ages 8 and 9 and love to hang out with their friends who they HUG very often.</li>
            <li>My daughter broke out in a full body rash after use.  </li>
            <li>It works for a month or so, smells ok, but makes hair very straw</li>
            <li>I check their hair often and luckily did so yesterday.</li>
            <li>So maybe it was the shampoo, or maybe we were just lucky, but either way it was definitely worth the $20 investment.</li>
            <li>Bought it as a preventive shampoo for attracting bugs on a trip to a very buggy area, uncertain accomodations, and now, use it everyday as my regular shampoo since it&#x27;s made of good things, smells nice &amp; is effective.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel comfortable saying it absolutely works.  </li>
            <li>fun).....</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely worth it if it is keeping the lice away.</li>
            <li>well worth the expense now</li>
            <li>You definitely need conditioner with the shampoo as it can be kind of drying.  </li>
            <li>Good shampoo, but be careful not to get in the kids eyes.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out his hair and it leaves it nice, shiny and CLEAN.</li>
            <li>What do you have to lose right?</li>
            <li>so we caught right away.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t order it right away.  </li>
            <li>Smells pretty decent, good for daily use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very mild, and something I didn&#x27;t even know was how eco-friendly it was, all natural ingredients, no parabens, etc.  </li>
            <li>but now I always make sure we have some of this shampoo to deter any lice issues for future.</li>
            <li>I think I like this shampoo even better than our regular brand.  </li>
            <li>The only shampoo we use on my grand daughters hair.</li>
            <li>Not a trace of lice in our home since the first time my daughter came home from school with it over a year ago.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really repels lice!</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s usually pretty picky about those things.</li>
            <li>After our first outbreak of lice, I stocked up on the Fairy Tales shampoo and spray.  </li>
            <li>They smell FANTASTIC and make their hair so soft.</li>
            <li>Client requested and got a great deal with the purchase of other items, made it worth purchasing it at the same time.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice to have to use once a week or before sleepovers or any other type of kid head closeness.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m positive that when i started using this shampoo there were still kids at school that were infested.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mild and it leaves the kids hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li>Of course I bought the large bottle.  </li>
            <li>and it took a real heart-to-heart with a couple moms to stop the madness.  </li>
            <li>This is a well made, quality shampoo that is gentle for kids.</li>
            <li>The shield spray is very sticky, like hairspray.</li>
            <li>Shampoo really does the trick.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping from the seller.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and moisturizing and seems to work at keeping the bugs at bay.</li>
            <li>I recommend people to buy this works very well u will like it</li>
            <li>and I really do like this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I am a 100% satisfied customer and I have recommended these products to the other parents.</li>
            <li>My two boys love this shampoo and conditioner and stopped using any other I bought.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t normally use it on his twin sister because she has very curly out of control hair which needs alot of conditioning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how effective it is in terms of repelling lice</li>
            <li>Highly itchy and all over.  </li>
            <li>I love my little munchkins and they run up to hug me.  </li>
            <li>We got this shampoo because lice were starting to spread in the elementary schools.  </li>
            <li>This latest version seems to have less of that by far, even without a conditioner.</li>
            <li>Annual live outbreak at school.</li>
            <li>Although there have been some outbreaks at school since he&#x27;s been using this, we&#x27;ve been clear!  </li>
            <li>My 6 yr old loves the rosemary, tea tree, citronella-ish smell too!</li>
            <li>how well it actually works just making people aware some may have reactions to the ingredients.</li>
            <li>The smell is a little strong, but it seems harmless</li>
            <li>scent of the shampoo is a little strong but daughter doesn&#x27;t mind the smell</li>
            <li>Shampoo is fine , however the lid was not screws on tight and as a result a substantial amount of the shampoo leaked out of the bottle into the packaging.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it seems to add body to my limp hair.</li>
            <li>Leaves my fine hair soft without having to use conditioner, although, I&#x27;ll use a few spritz&#x27;s of the leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li>The lice went away in January and everyone has been clear since.  </li>
            <li>We need to get shampoo anyway, so it seems reasonable... and as far as I know, despite some severe outbreaks, no one in our community who has used the Rosemary Repel products has actually gotten lice.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat a natural, organic product I guess.    </li>
            <li>I bought it to protect them and got an unexpected bonus,..a shampoo they and I both</li>
            <li>I am a professional lice remover</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak for it&#x27;s ability to repel lice since we had them professionally removed.</li>
            <li>This is supposed to be a natural lice and bug deterrent.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Thank goodness there is a prevention that fits in with my son&#x27;s natural routine.  </li>
            <li>So far it hasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I use it for my 5 year old in addition to the conditioner and leave in conditioning spray.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft before using conditioner.</li>
            <li>Interestingly, lice like clean hair best--rather than dirty hair.  </li>
            <li>HA HA HA.....11 weeks later as my two year old was in my lap, I just happened to see one live louse in his hair.</li>
            <li>Could be a coincidence, but it&#x27;s hard to deny the strong correlation.</li>
            <li>As a parent who has been through this, I can tell you that lice are a new breed of super-bug that are immune to traditional medicinal treatments.</li>
            <li>I have an 8-year old and I used this in 2013 and the school had several lice out-breaks; my kid never got lice when we used Fairy Tales.</li>
            <li>the standard use, the natural ingredients, and the fact that we have yet to have any issues for the deterrent use</li>
            <li>I can say they haven&#x27;t come back, but the shampoo can be give at most a small amount of partial credit in that regard.</li>
            <li>Finally we brought in a professional lice removal service who showed us how to do a proper comb out (using the Terminator comb) and an enzyme type product to loosen the nit glue.  </li>
            <li>My son came home from school with lice earlier this year (blegh) and after I treated him with OTC lice shampoo and went through the whole process getting rid of them (nitpicking and a second treatment after ten days), I purchased this shampoo to help prevent future infestations with low expectations.</li>
            <li>My daughter got lice at school and after spending two long sessions combing her hair out I went hunting for a natural solution to help prevent another lice incident.</li>
            <li>My kids just entered preschool/daycare for the first time a few months ago.</li>
            <li>I tore my house and beds and towels and rugs and pillows apart-washed everything in practically boiling water about every day for a week and treated my two little boys (who had gorgeous thick blond curls)with the harsh chemical lice treatments from the pharmacy.</li>

            <li> And it&#x27;s natural and smells good!</li>
            <li> Also, per their own materials, the products must be layered for full effect.  </li>
            <li> If you can afford the products THEY ARE WORTH EVERY PENNY!!</li>
            <li> Anything that keeps lice away is worth it!!</li>
            <li> But, I really do like it and feel good about using it.  </li>
            <li> It smells good and leaves my daughter&#x27;s hair very combable without needing conditioner.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is pleasant enough, it has a nice rosemary/tea tree smell to it that I like, but the kids don&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li> very nice shampoo Makes my daughters hair so soft</li>
            <li> We have successfully completed a full year of daycare without lice thanks to this product.  </li>
            <li> So much so I&#x27;ve started using the product myself just so my hair looks better!  </li>
            <li> Excellent product, easy to use and works as advertised without any harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, smell is nice and so far no lice !</li>
            <li> I am unsure if the product works because the smell is very strong and my 4 year olds refused to let me wash their hair with it after the first time.</li>
            <li> In fact all Fairy Tales treatment products are fantastic.</li>
            <li> In my opinion they are the premium head lice removal products available.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> Lightly scented.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Used it a couple times smells oretty strong not a bad smell....</li>
            <li> They arrive quickly and are the same great quality as you will get on the manufacturer&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li> assuming that you are a clean person and value cleanliness).</li>
            <li> and she was completely clean.</li>
            <li> nurse always asks my kids if &amp;#34;mommy is still using the special shampoo&amp;#34; when she goes about checking kids for lice.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> They are ages 8 and 9 and love to hang out with their friends who they HUG very often.</li>
            <li> My daughter broke out in a full body rash after use.  </li>
            <li> It works for a month or so, smells ok, but makes hair very straw</li>
            <li> I check their hair often and luckily did so yesterday.</li>
            <li> So maybe it was the shampoo, or maybe we were just lucky, but either way it was definitely worth the $20 investment.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a preventive shampoo for attracting bugs on a trip to a very buggy area, uncertain accomodations, and now, use it everyday as my regular shampoo since it&#x27;s made of good things, smells nice &amp; is effective.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel comfortable saying it absolutely works.  </li>
            <li> fun).....</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely worth it if it is keeping the lice away.</li>
            <li> well worth the expense now</li>
            <li> You definitely need conditioner with the shampoo as it can be kind of drying.  </li>
            <li> Good shampoo, but be careful not to get in the kids eyes.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out his hair and it leaves it nice, shiny and CLEAN.</li>
            <li> What do you have to lose right?</li>
            <li> so we caught right away.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t order it right away.  </li>
            <li> Smells pretty decent, good for daily use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very mild, and something I didn&#x27;t even know was how eco-friendly it was, all natural ingredients, no parabens, etc.  </li>
            <li> but now I always make sure we have some of this shampoo to deter any lice issues for future.</li>
            <li> I think I like this shampoo even better than our regular brand.  </li>
            <li> The only shampoo we use on my grand daughters hair.</li>
            <li> Not a trace of lice in our home since the first time my daughter came home from school with it over a year ago.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really repels lice!</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s usually pretty picky about those things.</li>
            <li> After our first outbreak of lice, I stocked up on the Fairy Tales shampoo and spray.  </li>
            <li> They smell FANTASTIC and make their hair so soft.</li>
            <li> Client requested and got a great deal with the purchase of other items, made it worth purchasing it at the same time.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice to have to use once a week or before sleepovers or any other type of kid head closeness.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m positive that when i started using this shampoo there were still kids at school that were infested.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mild and it leaves the kids hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Of course I bought the large bottle.  </li>
            <li> and it took a real heart-to-heart with a couple moms to stop the madness.  </li>
            <li> This is a well made, quality shampoo that is gentle for kids.</li>
            <li> The shield spray is very sticky, like hairspray.</li>
            <li> Shampoo really does the trick.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping from the seller.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and moisturizing and seems to work at keeping the bugs at bay.</li>
            <li> I recommend people to buy this works very well u will like it</li>
            <li> and I really do like this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I am a 100% satisfied customer and I have recommended these products to the other parents.</li>
            <li> My two boys love this shampoo and conditioner and stopped using any other I bought.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t normally use it on his twin sister because she has very curly out of control hair which needs alot of conditioning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how effective it is in terms of repelling lice</li>
            <li> Highly itchy and all over.  </li>
            <li> I love my little munchkins and they run up to hug me.  </li>
            <li> We got this shampoo because lice were starting to spread in the elementary schools.  </li>
            <li> This latest version seems to have less of that by far, even without a conditioner.</li>
            <li> Annual live outbreak at school.</li>
            <li> Although there have been some outbreaks at school since he&#x27;s been using this, we&#x27;ve been clear!  </li>
            <li> My 6 yr old loves the rosemary, tea tree, citronella-ish smell too!</li>
            <li> how well it actually works just making people aware some may have reactions to the ingredients.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little strong, but it seems harmless</li>
            <li> scent of the shampoo is a little strong but daughter doesn&#x27;t mind the smell</li>
            <li> Shampoo is fine , however the lid was not screws on tight and as a result a substantial amount of the shampoo leaked out of the bottle into the packaging.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and it seems to add body to my limp hair.</li>
            <li> Leaves my fine hair soft without having to use conditioner, although, I&#x27;ll use a few spritz&#x27;s of the leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> The lice went away in January and everyone has been clear since.  </li>
            <li> We need to get shampoo anyway, so it seems reasonable... and as far as I know, despite some severe outbreaks, no one in our community who has used the Rosemary Repel products has actually gotten lice.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat a natural, organic product I guess.    </li>
            <li> I bought it to protect them and got an unexpected bonus,..a shampoo they and I both</li>
            <li> I am a professional lice remover</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for it&#x27;s ability to repel lice since we had them professionally removed.</li>
            <li> This is supposed to be a natural lice and bug deterrent.  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness there is a prevention that fits in with my son&#x27;s natural routine.  </li>
            <li> So far it hasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I use it for my 5 year old in addition to the conditioner and leave in conditioning spray.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft before using conditioner.</li>
            <li> Interestingly, lice like clean hair best--rather than dirty hair.  </li>
            <li> HA HA HA.....11 weeks later as my two year old was in my lap, I just happened to see one live louse in his hair.</li>
            <li> Could be a coincidence, but it&#x27;s hard to deny the strong correlation.</li>
            <li> As a parent who has been through this, I can tell you that lice are a new breed of super-bug that are immune to traditional medicinal treatments.</li>
            <li> I have an 8-year old and I used this in 2013 and the school had several lice out-breaks; my kid never got lice when we used Fairy Tales.</li>
            <li> the standard use, the natural ingredients, and the fact that we have yet to have any issues for the deterrent use</li>
            <li> I can say they haven&#x27;t come back, but the shampoo can be give at most a small amount of partial credit in that regard.</li>
            <li> Finally we brought in a professional lice removal service who showed us how to do a proper comb out (using the Terminator comb) and an enzyme type product to loosen the nit glue.  </li>
            <li> My son came home from school with lice earlier this year (blegh) and after I treated him with OTC lice shampoo and went through the whole process getting rid of them (nitpicking and a second treatment after ten days), I purchased this shampoo to help prevent future infestations with low expectations.</li>
            <li> My daughter got lice at school and after spending two long sessions combing her hair out I went hunting for a natural solution to help prevent another lice incident.</li>
            <li> My kids just entered preschool/daycare for the first time a few months ago.</li>
            <li> I tore my house and beds and towels and rugs and pillows apart-washed everything in practically boiling water about every day for a week and treated my two little boys (who had gorgeous thick blond curls)with the harsh chemical lice treatments from the pharmacy.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it was very liquified when I got it!</li>
            <li> My new tactic is to apply a little DEET insect repellent/lotion at her hairline just after bath as a preventive - we&#x27;ll see if that works.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, halve the price of Fairy Tales shampoo</li>
            <li> After doing this twice and knowing my house HAD to be free of ANYTHING, I was exhausted but confident that I had defeated the ugly lice problem.</li>
            <li> so I wasted quite a bit early on.  </li>
            <li> We used the shampoo religiously on my 2nd grade son, and used the spray about every other day.  </li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair hasn&#x27;t been too dry</li>
            <li> to see decent results, i found that i should use it 3 times a week at least for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> they have stayed without as i check them every single night.</li>
            <li> As for a previous review, lice eggs can take two weeks to hatch, so it&#x27;s possible they were already in the child&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> and I like that they at least claim it is made with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Her hair got wet and while she was sitting on my lap in the bus</li>
            <li> While other kids in my daughter&#x27;s class have caught lice, my daughter never has.</li>
            <li> I guess it has to be like that due to the ingredients and</li>
            <li> And they have been around other kids that have it.</li>
            <li> like and doesn&#x27;t protect against lice as well as other products.</li>
            <li> I have not had ANY ISSUES with lice or other bugs since letting the girls usse this and the leave-in conditioning spray.</li>
            <li> I chose this shampoo based on the reviews I read here and other sites as well.</li>
            <li> I bought the same product a few years ago as a preventative measure and felt that it was harsh on my daughter&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> like I see other products that other parents use does to their kids!</li>
            <li> deep conditioning a must at least once a week.</li>
            <li> ...and for that reason, not worth the $10+ cost.</li>
            <li> although I can already tell it is stripping the color out of my color-treated hair and drying it out considerably, so I may just resort to adding a few drops of Tea Tree oil to my regular shampoo instead - also a much less expensive option.</li>
            <li> But I think the only thing that really works is using the nit comb on everyone in the house every single week.  :(</li>
            <li> This was a slightly paranoid purchase in the aftermath of a run in with lice in our home.</li>
            <li> Slightly drying for those with curly hair so,</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my daughter was highly allergic to this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> so I immediately switched her to the Rosemary Repel shampoo and conditioner and we just found out, after two weeks of using the Rosemary Repel products and sending her to school with her hair in tight braids, that she has lice now too....</li>
            <li> I have two little girls.  </li>
            <li> and when I need a little bit of conditioner, I just use Johnson and Johnson&#x27;s leave in conditioner to save on the cost a little bit.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about all the oil mentioned in the product, but I needn&#x27;t have.  </li>
            <li> If nothing else it gave us a little peace of mind in the week or two after the discovery and removal of lice.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is a little pricey but</li>
            <li> I think every few days is probably best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it dried out her scalp.  </li>
            <li> We use this all year round to ward off lice.</li>
            <li> And it does not leave my daughter&#x27;s hair greasy or stiff</li>
            <li> UNTIL this past week...</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s luck or the product</li>
            <li> Did not love the sent of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Getting lice is one thing I just would have a hard time handling--with three kids and a dog and homeschooling.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m adjusted to how hard to squeeze the bottle</li>
            <li> However, the smell is just really bad, especially for a little girl.  </li>
            <li> My daughter does tell me she hasn&#x27;t noticed the gnats flying around her face lately.  </li>
            <li> After using this for abour 3 days, we have seen no more bugs!</li>
            <li> I think this is going to have to be going back along with the conditioning spray. :(</li>
            <li> THEN, I wrapped their poor heads, which were burning from the chemical in plastic wrap after having saturated their hair in olive oil.</li>
            <li> I also have the spray on leave in conditioner which can be used daily and doubles as a bug repellent!</li>
            <li> I told him lice or bad smell.</li>
            <li> Sadly...one has lice :(.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll keep buying it - but not as a lice repellent.</li>
            <li> , LICE HAVE NEVER RETURNED EVEN WHEN THERE HAVE BEEN TERRIBLE OUTBREAKS</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I hope this item actually works but there is no way for me to know forsure. My daughter had nits going around in her school and so i bought this along with the spray as a precaution and she has not had any nits. The smell is a bit strong, not too great.</li>
            <li> Since the 3rd grade, lice has been a constant issue at my daughter&#x27;s school.  Last school year (4th grade), it took me months to get rid of her lice, she kept getting re-infested and it took a real heart-to-heart with a couple moms to stop the madness.  The lice went away in January and everyone has been clear since.  UNTIL this past week...one of my daughter&#x27;s friends slept overnight Friday, they went to a birthday party Saturday and on Saturday night we received the dreaded &amp;#34;I have lice&amp;#34; message.  I was horrified!  As of today...my daughter is still lice free!  She was like a lice magnet in prior incidents and I thank Fairy Tales for this miracle!  I&#x27;m ecstatic and do not know why anyone wouldn&#x27;t use this product as their regular shampoo and conditioner for ever!</li>
            <li> I use it  for my daughter. She is 5. I washed her hair with that shampoo. The next day when I picked her up from school it was raining. Her hair got wet and while she was sitting on my lap in the bus I noiced her hair smelled like a puppy, maybe because it is herbal shampoo so animal shampoos smell similar?</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> This is a well made, quality shampoo that is gentle for kids. It smells good, isn&#x27;t too drying, and - knock on wood- seems to be repelling any bugs. I like this shampoo and will reorder when it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> i was very impressed with this shampoo. good investment. to see decent results, i found that i should use it 3 times a week at least for 2 weeks. but effective.</li>
            <li> We purchased this product (shampoo and conditioning spray) on several Moms recommendation.  We used it for six weeks on both our daughters.  Sadly...one has lice :(.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great!  I have two little girls.  I don&#x27;t need to use a lot of this each time I wash their hair.  I don&#x27;t mind the smell at all and my girls like it.  Interestingly, lice like clean hair best--rather than dirty hair.  On the company&#x27;s website and blog, they note that hair doesn&#x27;t need to be washed every day.  I think every few days is probably best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any lice in my house yet and I use this shampoo more for piece of mind.  Getting lice is one thing I just would have a hard time handling--with three kids and a dog and homeschooling.  But, I really do like it and feel good about using it.  My daughter&#x27;s hair hasn&#x27;t been too dry and when I need a little bit of conditioner, I just use Johnson and Johnson&#x27;s leave in conditioner to save on the cost a little bit.</li>
            <li> Great for kids and the prevention of lice. Smells good too. I have an 8-year old and I used this in 2013 and the school had several lice out-breaks; my kid never got lice when we used Fairy Tales. We moved and I ran out of this shampoo and used another shampoo. Her school got a lice in 2014 and my kid did too (not fun).....We eradicated the lice in our home but now I always make sure we have some of this shampoo to deter any lice issues for future. It seems to work.</li>
            <li> Daughter loves the smell and after an outbreak in her class with lice, we kept them at bay with the shampoo.  Best investment ever.</li>
            <li> If you have ever been through the horrendous and embarrassing situation of finding lice in your children&#x27;s hair, you know that it is the most frantic work a parent will have to endure (assuming that you are a clean person and value cleanliness). I tore my house and beds and towels and rugs and pillows apart-washed everything in practically boiling water about every day for a week and treated my two little boys (who had gorgeous thick blond curls)with the harsh chemical lice treatments from the pharmacy. THEN, I wrapped their poor heads, which were burning from the chemical in plastic wrap after having saturated their hair in olive oil. Try keeping two children ages 2 and five to sit for 3 hours with THAT on their heads. After doing this twice and knowing my house HAD to be free of ANYTHING, I was exhausted but confident that I had defeated the ugly lice problem. HA HA HA.....11 weeks later as my two year old was in my lap, I just happened to see one live louse in his hair. I flipped out!!!! I had been checking their heads daily and there was nothing, to my delight. OMG!!! THEN I STUMBLED UPON THE FAIRY TALES WEBSITE and MY LIFE WAS INSTANTLY CHANGED. I ORDERED EVERYTHING!! IT WORKED, LICE HAVE NEVER RETURNED EVEN WHEN THERE HAVE BEEN TERRIBLE OUTBREAKS AT SCHOOL. I am still vigilant about checking heads thoroughly twice a week, but I COULD NOT BE HAPPIER WITH THESE PRODUCTS. I even use the conditioner on occasion and I like it. The kids like the smell, I like the smell, and it doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate. As a parent who has been through this, I can tell you that lice are a new breed of super-bug that are immune to traditional medicinal treatments. If you can afford the products THEY ARE WORTH EVERY PENNY!! I hope this helps. It changed my life for the better. It has been 18 months since we began using these products, and I order my \\&quot;refills\\&quot; through Amazon. They arrive quickly and are the same great quality as you will get on the manufacturer&#x27;s website. The comb to remove nits is the best I had ever seen, as well.move nits is the best I had ever seen, as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo, conditioner and detangling spray on my daughter every day.  (Well, we shampoo/condition about twice a week.)  I use the shampoo and gel on my son&#x27;s hair in the same way.  We have not had issues with lice yet.  I would give the products 5 stars, but until they are around children with lice (we fought it for 6 months in the classroom last year!) I don&#x27;t feel comfortable saying it absolutely works.  For me, I figure we&#x27;ve got to buy shampoo etc. anyway, might as well use a preventative one.  My daughter does tell me she hasn&#x27;t noticed the gnats flying around her face lately.  I was a little concerned about all the oil mentioned in the product, but I needn&#x27;t have.  My daughter&#x27;s shoulder length hair always looks lovely.  So much so I&#x27;ve started using the product myself just so my hair looks better!  Can&#x27;t beat a natural, organic product I guess.    As for a previous review, lice eggs can take two weeks to hatch, so it&#x27;s possible they were already in the child&#x27;s hair.  Using the preventative products after the fact isn&#x27;t going to help.  Also, per their own materials, the products must be layered for full effect.  The shampoo alone only has about a 70% rate of working.  But, adding the conditioner and then leave-in spray (or gel) brings it to about 100% by (admittedly) their own research.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells awesome and works well. I bought it because it promises to help prevent lice - I can&#x27;t say how well it does this but I will buy it again. The only reason for 4 stars is the cost. I have 3 kids and at 10 dollars a bottle it sure is pricey!</li>
            <li> I think I like this shampoo even better than our regular brand.  It smells nice and leaves my daughters hair smooth and manageable.  I bought it to protect them and got an unexpected bonus,..a shampoo they and I both love!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s alittle bit thinner, texture-wise, than what I&#x27;m used to so I wasted quite a bit early on.  Now I&#x27;m adjusted to how hard to squeeze the bottle and we&#x27;re all good!&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and no lice here!</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Great for kids!</li>
            <li> The only shampoo we use on my grand daughters hair.</li>
            <li> This product rocks. In fact all Fairy Tales treatment products are fantastic. I am a professional lice remover and I could not do my job as well as I do without the marvellous products from Fairy Tales. In my opinion they are the premium head lice removal products available. [...]</li>
            <li> I guess this works okay, my daughter didn&#x27;t catch lice while it was going around in her classroom, and that was good!!</li>
            <li> This was a slightly paranoid purchase in the aftermath of a run in with lice in our home. The shampoo is pleasant enough, it has a nice rosemary/tea tree smell to it that I like, but the kids don&#x27;t care for. I can&#x27;t speak for it&#x27;s ability to repel lice since we had them professionally removed. I can say they haven&#x27;t come back, but the shampoo can be give at most a small amount of partial credit in that regard. As a regular shampoo it gets the job done, though not as well as our regular shampoo and at the expense of the kids complaining. If nothing else it gave us a little peace of mind in the week or two after the discovery and removal of lice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rosemary Repel shampoo and leave in conditioner on my son every wash (every 2 days or so) and he has not gotten lice. I didn&#x27;t normally use it on his twin sister because she has very curly out of control hair which needs alot of conditioning. Well we got the dreaded news that someone in my daughters class had lice so I immediately switched her to the Rosemary Repel shampoo and conditioner and we just found out, after two weeks of using the Rosemary Repel products and sending her to school with her hair in tight braids, that she has lice now too....so it didn&#x27;t save us.  I guess it&#x27;s not foolproof but I&#x27;ll still use it unless i find something better.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and feels good on hair...</li>
            <li> Everyone I know who uses this product has nothing but good things to say.  I haven&#x27;t heard anyone getting lice while using the \\&quot;Fairy Tales\\&quot; products.  Hopefully that continues!  I use it when there is a case of lice in my kids&#x27; school.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a  music teacher and I teach over 500 children so this is a must when it&#x27;s &amp;#34;that time of the year&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Fairy Tales does the job.  I love my little munchkins and they run up to hug me.  I refuse to push them away so I use this shampoo and In 14 years of teaching, I have not gotten lice.  Whew!  It works.</li>
            <li> It smells good, our hair feels good, and let&#x27;s face it... it can&#x27;t hurt.  You will smell a lot like rosemary, but if you can handle that, I&#x27;d use it.  We need to get shampoo anyway, so it seems reasonable... and as far as I know, despite some severe outbreaks, no one in our community who has used the Rosemary Repel products has actually gotten lice.  So- who knows?  I like the leave in conditioning spray the best, by the way.  The shield spray is very sticky, like hairspray.</li>
            <li> This works! I bought this for all my grandchildren on the advice of a school nurse&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> My girls use nothing but the Fairly Tale products on their hair.  Have not gotten lice since its use and smells great.</li>
            <li> Shampoo is fine , however the lid was not screws on tight and as a result a substantial amount of the shampoo leaked out of the bottle into the packaging. l, resulting in a loss of product.</li>
            <li> This is supposed to be a natural lice and bug deterrent.  In 3 years, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s been doing it&#x27;s job \\&quot;knock on wood.\\&quot;  It also smells soooooooo nice, even I like using it.  It&#x27;s very mild, and something I didn&#x27;t even know was how eco-friendly it was, all natural ingredients, no parabens, etc.  I&#x27;d say for the scent, the standard use, the natural ingredients, and the fact that we have yet to have any issues for the deterrent use, it&#x27;s worth it.  &#x3D;)  What do you have to lose right?</li>
            <li> Last year there was a lice outbreak in my daughter&#x27;s class. When the school nurse found nits in her hair she was so embarrassed.  After the chaos of combing and treating and triple checking, I vowed to do whatever it took to prevent that. I bought the shampoo and leave-in-conditioner this fall at the start of the school year, and she has used it faithfully. There was an outbreak last week in her class and she was completely clean. I am a 100% satisfied customer and I have recommended these products to the other parents.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used this brand for over 2 yrs now. While other kids in my daughter&#x27;s class have caught lice, my daughter never has. Not sure if it&#x27;s luck or the product but we&#x27;re not taking any chances! My 6 yr old loves the rosemary, tea tree, citronella-ish smell too! And it does not leave my daughter&#x27;s hair greasy or stiff like I see other products that other parents use does to their kids!</li>
            <li> Did not love the sent of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is the only reason the kids have never had lice when there&#x27;s an outbtreak at school.  The daily spray and shampoo also go to Summer Camp, they keep the bugs from buzzing around heads.</li>
            <li> Great, fresh-smelling product! Anything that keeps lice away is worth it!!</li>
            <li> There was a lice epidemic going around my children&#x27;s day care. Someone recommended Fairy Tales products to me. I have no idea whether it actually works or not, but I can tell you I religiously washed my children&#x27;s hair every night with this shampoo for a month and neither got lice. So maybe it was the shampoo, or maybe we were just lucky, but either way it was definitely worth the $20 investment. The smell is a little strong, but it seems harmless and I like that they at least claim it is made with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Smells pretty decent, good for daily use. Havent had any recurrence after one medicated treatment and daily use of this.</li>
            <li> Not a trace of lice in our home since the first time my daughter came home from school with it over a year ago.  Great product!</li>
            <li> my niece swears by it</li>
            <li> Used it a couple times smells oretty strong not a bad smell.... hoping it does what it says</li>
            <li> As part of the system for this brand it&#x27;s nice to have to use once a week or before sleepovers or any other type of kid head closeness.  Nice herbal scent.  A conditioner is needed.</li>
            <li> Annual live outbreak at school. Shampoo really does the trick. Smells fantastic. Leaves hair soft and manageable. Lightly scented. Going to get a bottle for me.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve never had lice in our house but a lot of our friends recently got it. I bought this shampoo to prevent an outbreak for us and I really like it. It&#x27;s mild and it leaves the kids hair feeling soft. Our kids are 6 and 3. We use it every day. (My kids are the kind of kids that need to be bathed every day and get their hair washed every day.)</li>
            <li> I bought the same product a few years ago as a preventative measure and felt that it was harsh on my daughter&#x27;s hair and it dried out her scalp.  This latest version seems to have less of that by far, even without a conditioner.</li>
            <li> very nice shampoo Makes my daughters hair so soft just incredible! Thinking to use myself too now!</li>
            <li> I do not like the very strong smell.  I have been using since there was a lice outbreak at my daughter&#x27;s school.  She has not gotten lice, so I&#x27;m hopeful that it is doing its job.  However, the smell is just really bad, especially for a little girl.  I guess it has to be like that due to the ingredients and what it is supposed to do though.  It is definitely worth it if it is keeping the lice away.</li>
            <li> My kids just entered preschool/daycare for the first time a few months ago. We are using this shampoo and a the spray. I check their hair often and luckily did so yesterday. The pharmacist said that she must have contracted it just that morning so we caught right away. Nothing is 100% so we&#x27;ll continue to use this product and hope it doesn&#x27;t happen again.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, smell is nice and so far no lice ! I also like the detangling spray, again light and nice smell, the kids think it is strong but nice when it dries. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is a little pricey but well worth the expense now then the expense of cleaning your whole house, taking off of work, kids missing school and all of the products you need to get rid of the bugs. This stuff really repels lice! I will use this forever because since my kids have started using it they have not had lice once. And they have been around other kids that have it. This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> got this for the granddaughters-school and all the lice was a bit much-none now</li>
            <li> A bit smelly but good.  Dries the hair a bit.</li>
            <li> My girls love the smell of this shampoo and during the Lice scare around school they have stayed without as i check them every single night. They are ages 8 and 9 and love to hang out with their friends who they HUG very often.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Bought it as a preventive shampoo for attracting bugs on a trip to a very buggy area, uncertain accomodations, and now, use it everyday as my regular shampoo since it&#x27;s made of good things, smells nice &amp; is effective.  Leaves my fine hair soft without having to use conditioner, although, I&#x27;ll use a few spritz&#x27;s of the leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my daughter was highly allergic to this shampoo.  I bought it for prevention purposes not to get rid of lice.  My daughter broke out in a full body rash after use.  Highly itchy and all over.  I had also used it but had no allergic reaction.  Needless to say we won&#x27;t be able to utilize it.  Of course I bought the large bottle.  No idea how well it actually works just making people aware some may have reactions to the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is just ok. It works for a month or so, smells ok, but makes hair very straw like and doesn&#x27;t protect against lice as well as other products. Over all  rating:  2.5 stars.</li>
            <li> We had 2 children bring lice home recently and went into an all out war trying to get rid of them.  Finally we brought in a professional lice removal service who showed us how to do a proper comb out (using the Terminator comb) and an enzyme type product to loosen the nit glue.  She did mention that several of the ingredients in this product were a known repellant of lice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have started using this on all the family members... although I can already tell it is stripping the color out of my color-treated hair and drying it out considerably, so I may just resort to adding a few drops of Tea Tree oil to my regular shampoo instead - also a much less expensive option.</li>
            <li> I am unsure if the product works because the smell is very strong and my 4 year olds refused to let me wash their hair with it after the first time.</li>
            <li> My daughter got lice at school and after spending two long sessions combing her hair out I went hunting for a natural solution to help prevent another lice incident. We&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month and fingers crossed, have been lice free.&lt;br /&gt;The scent of the shampoo is a little strong but daughter doesn&#x27;t mind the smell and she&#x27;s usually pretty picky about those things.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo for lice protection. My only complaint is that it was very liquified when I got it! When you open to use, it pours out without even having to squeeze!</li>
            <li> Thank goodness there is a prevention that fits in with my son&#x27;s natural routine.  He uses this when he shampoos and likes the way it smells.  Although there have been some outbreaks at school since he&#x27;s been using this, we&#x27;ve been clear!  Thank goodness.</li>
            <li> Client requested and got a great deal with the purchase of other items, made it worth purchasing it at the same time.</li>
            <li> Shampoo works wonders for lice. Fast shipping from the seller.</li>
            <li> Works well as we have made it through an entire school year and summer. Slightly drying for those with curly hair so, deep conditioning a must at least once a week.</li>
            <li> great shampoo. Thanks</li>
            <li> We have successfully completed a full year of daycare without lice thanks to this product.  Many children were infested at one point or another, but mine wasn&#x27;t one of them!  Smells great too!</li>
            <li> My girls and I don&#x27;t like the scent.  I think this is going to have to be going back along with the conditioning spray. :(</li>
            <li> This stuff works great, I have 4 kids and we haven&#x27;t had an issue with any!</li>
            <li> Good price and helpful product. We use this all year round to ward off lice. We like the smell too.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, easy to use and works as advertised without any harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I&#x27;m not sure how effective it is in terms of repelling lice but I&#x27;m hoping it works</li>
            <li> This product works great! And it&#x27;s natural and smells good!</li>
            <li> My two boys love this shampoo and conditioner and stopped using any other I bought.  They love the way it smells.  I like that it may help the lice that continues to go through our community since the outbreak this summer at camp.  We have yet to get it...  You definitely need conditioner with the shampoo as it can be kind of drying.  I also have the spray on leave in conditioner which can be used daily and doubles as a bug repellent!</li>
            <li> We use this product religiously. It&#x27;s gentle and moisturizing and seems to work at keeping the bugs at bay. Both times my daughter has had lice over the years, it was during a period when we ran out and were using a different shampoo. Could be a coincidence, but it&#x27;s hard to deny the strong correlation.</li>
            <li> Bought this shampoo during a lice incident.  Kept using it in fear of the lice coming back.  So far it hasn&#x27;t.  Was it because of this shampoo and the conditioner?  Who knows, but the shampoo cleans nicely, smells pretty good, so why not.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my hairdresser who said it will help prevent lice.  The product smells good too!  My child uses this product 2 times a week.</li>
            <li> Good shampoo, but be careful not to get in the kids eyes.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. We&#x27;ve used it on our children since my oldest started school &amp; we&#x27;ve never yet had a case of head lice. (Knock on wood) And believe me, there have been cases im of lice in the school each year!&lt;br /&gt;The nurse always asks my kids if &amp;#34;mommy is still using the special shampoo&amp;#34; when she goes about checking kids for lice.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very pleasant.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product on my daughter&#x27;s hair for almost 2 years.  She ran out and I didn&#x27;t order it right away.  Well, that was a mistake because she got lice.  I used the non-toxic lice removal and it worked great.  We do not plan on ever running out of this shampoo again while school is in session.  Definitely works.</li>
            <li> Makes the hair look greasy</li>
            <li> After our first outbreak of lice, I stocked up on the Fairy Tales shampoo and spray.  We used the shampoo religiously on my 2nd grade son, and used the spray about every other day.  He got lice again 2 months later.  I&#x27;ll probably still use the shampoo and spray (can&#x27;t hurt, might help) since it contains the essential oils that are supposed to work.  But I think the only thing that really works is using the nit comb on everyone in the house every single week.  :(</li>
            <li> Love this product. I use it for my 5 year old in addition to the conditioner and leave in conditioning spray. The smell is wonderful and leaves her hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Good product for kids and you can use every day with no side effect and good smell as well. I recommend for every parent</li>
            <li> ...and for that reason, not worth the $10+ cost. It IS nice smelling, quality shampoo. Used exclusively for months, my daughter still managed to get lice again. My new tactic is to apply a little DEET insect repellent/lotion at her hairline just after bath as a preventive - we&#x27;ll see if that works.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, halve the price of Fairy Tales shampoo and I&#x27;ll keep buying it - but not as a lice repellent.</li>
            <li> I recommend people to buy this works very well u will like it</li>
            <li> After using this for abour 3 days, we have seen no more bugs! Great product. I also used this with the conditioner and the spray leave-in conditioner and hairspray!</li>
            <li> I started buying this for my girls last year after they got lice from their school. I have not had ANY ISSUES with lice or other bugs since letting the girls usse this and the leave-in conditioning spray. They smell FANTASTIC and make their hair so soft. I confess that I use them both about once a week as well. They love it and it keeps me sane! Thanks!!</li>
            <li> My son hates the way it smells. I told him lice or bad smell. You choose.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome! I have fine hair and it seems to add body to my limp hair. My hair feels so soft before using conditioner. I will buy it again and I&#x27;ll recommend to others.</li>
            <li> My son came home from school with lice earlier this year (blegh) and after I treated him with OTC lice shampoo and went through the whole process getting rid of them (nitpicking and a second treatment after ten days), I purchased this shampoo to help prevent future infestations with low expectations. I chose this shampoo based on the reviews I read here and other sites as well. I started using it while we were still treating the lice and continued after they were all gone, he hasn&#x27;t brought home anymore lice - and I&#x27;m positive that when i started using this shampoo there were still kids at school that were infested. This stuff is great! It doesn&#x27;t dry out his hair and it leaves it nice, shiny and CLEAN. I also think it smells nice. It works! I check his hair every week and I haven&#x27;t seen a nit or a louse since- Nothing! Keep in mind, this is a preventative, not a treatment for lice - it won&#x27;t kill them it just deters them from setting up shop on your child&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> Anything to keep lice away, when school had it.</li>
            <li> We got this shampoo because lice were starting to spread in the elementary schools.  Will it help lice-proof my kids?  Eh, maybe maybe not.  Can&#x27;t hurt and I really do like this shampoo.  It smells good and leaves my daughter&#x27;s hair very combable without needing conditioner.</li>
