    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Have never had a brush that felt so wonderful to use.  </li>
            <li>It is well made and is the perfect combination of boar and nylon for a silky-smooth, tangle-free brushing experience.</li>
            <li>Great brush.</li>
            <li>Great buy.</li>
            <li>LOVE this brush!  </li>
            <li>I liked the product amazing reached on time and all was perfect thanks</li>
            <li>I love, love, LOVE this brush!</li>
            <li>Love, love love this brush!</li>
            <li>My FAVORITE brush.  </li>
            <li>Love this brush for blow drying and for brushing my should length hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, overall it is an excellent brush.</li>
            <li>This is more like the \\&quot;porcupine\\&quot; brushes that were made 10-20 years ago.</li>
            <li>My hair has never looked more healthier or had more shine until using the Macadamia brush.  </li>
            <li>Love this brush.  </li>
            <li>Does a great job, leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li>Its soft and is great to manage my hair.</li>
            <li>Keeps it from getting greasy too easily as well.  </li>
            <li>It is not a size you can travel with easily.</li>
            <li>Very good quality brush for long hair.</li>
            <li>Comfortable handle and easily detangles</li>
            <li>Best invest for long straight hair!</li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s any better for my hair, but it sure feels great against my scalp.</li>
            <li>Best paddle brush for my long straight hair</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite brush!</li>
            <li>I do wish they would have included how to clean this brush so as not to deter from the benefits of the  macadamia oil.</li>
            <li>If you have a really sensitive scalp this brush is amazing.</li>
            <li>This type of brush is designed to spread your hair&#x27;s natural wax and oil evenly, while still allowing the brush to penetrate through thicker hair to detangle it effectively.</li>
            <li>This may be true of any cushion \\&quot;porcupine\\&quot; brush frankly.</li>
            <li>This brush is about the best you can get for being scalp-friendly but still combing through fairly thick hair with ease.</li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s gentle on your scalp, and great on the hair, wide brush that I love, best paddle brush, a little pricey but so worth it, and it&#x27;s pretty too</li>
            <li>This brush glides right through my &amp;#34;nest&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I guess, don&#x27;t notice a significant difference, but it feels good when I brush my hair with this as opposed to brushes I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>you  very much, would like to have it again</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice brush for my thick wavy hair, but I feel like it doesn&#x27;t do well under the heat of my blow-dryer (which is why I bought it).</li>
            <li>It works great on my fine/thin relaxed hair as well as detangling my little girls natural frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost tempted to buy a few more and just keep them on stock!</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The ball tip is larger than other brands available and should be more gentle to the scalp.</li>
            <li>Better price than other places though I must say.</li>
            <li>It really cuts down on my frizz and help to make my hair more shiny.  </li>
            <li>It gives off a bit of a funny smell, but so far doesn&#x27;t seem to be damaged from it.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this brush</li>
            <li>So basically I got this brush because my new hair dresser shamed me for not having one of these super special, expensive yet magical, unparalleled (apparently) bore bristle brush that is suppose to do wonders for my hair...</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really soft against your scalp.</li>
            <li>It has soft boar bristles and longer nylon bristles with a ball tip end.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money I spent.</li>
            <li>I was recommended to purchase this brush by my hairstylist.my hair is long and slightly wavy.very satisfied with this tool.doesn&#x27;t break the hair</li>
            <li>Soft &amp; won&#x27;t tear my fragile hair</li>
            <li>Modern brushes tend to be a bit harder on the scalp, but not this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li>If you blow dry your hair with this brush, it leaves your hair amazingly soft and shiny.</li>

            <li> If you have really super thick hair, you may need a different type of brush, probably with stiff nylon bristles.</li>
            <li> long hair when needed without causing damage.</li>
            <li> The boar bristles are what I expected but the nylon bristles are way too soft to brush completely through my thick hair.</li>
            <li> strands.can be used even on the wet hair.</li>
            <li> I have long thin wavy hair that I would normally lose a lot of hair after washing/brushing it, but not with this brush.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair</li>
            <li> This brush is advertised for thick hair which it can&#x27;t fully brush through.</li>
            <li> My only real complaint (&amp; this is probably just my head of hair being a stubborn biotch) is that it said anti-static, but unfortunately my hair is just as staticy...</li>
            <li> people have complained that it does not do well with very thick hair.</li>
            <li> After a couple of months the bristles start falling out and the brush is useless</li>

            <li> Very good quality brush for long hair.</li>
            <li> So basically I got this brush because my new hair dresser shamed me for not having one of these super special, expensive yet magical, unparalleled (apparently) bore bristle brush that is suppose to do wonders for my hair...

            <li> I love, love, LOVE this brush! If you have a really sensitive scalp this brush is amazing. It detangles with ease and it&#x27;s really soft against your scalp.

            <li> I have curly hair that I like to brush out at night.  This brush glides right through my &amp;#34;nest&amp;#34;.  Does a great job, leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> My FAVORITE brush.  Soft &amp; won&#x27;t tear my fragile hair</li>

Doesn&#x27;t rip out my hair, and actually has done wonders for my dry tips.  I have long, thick, wavy hair and I have no problem getting this brush to work.  If you&#x27;re in doubt, just pull the trigger and give it a tray.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite brush! It works great on my fine/thin relaxed hair as well as detangling my little girls natural frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> This was much to big for me to use, and it may be larger than you expect. It is not a size you can travel with easily. I just wish it was a smaller regular porcupine brush. Then it would be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, overall it is an excellent brush. It has soft boar bristles and longer nylon bristles with a ball tip end. This type of brush is designed to spread your hair&#x27;s natural wax and oil evenly, while still allowing the brush to penetrate through thicker hair to detangle it effectively. The ball tip is larger than other brands available and should be more gentle to the scalp. This is more like the \\&quot;porcupine\\&quot; brushes that were made 10-20 years ago.
