            <li>product is a big win</li>

            <li>ingredients are honest and natural, it smell&#x27;s quite neutral yet nice, and it does a fine job moisturizing (especially in the winter).</li>
            <li>Even a paper cut had healed quickly.</li>
            <li>I love that it supports a important cause and that it leaves me feeling soft and smelling</li>

            <li>Although perhaps the smell was more than I was expecting initially, I did grow to enjoy it.</li>
            <li>It smells so fresh and yummy too.</li>
            <li>what it&#x27;s worth, Brassica plants are in the mustard family and include turnips, broccoli, etc.</li>
            <li>/first found out about it in samples given to first class Amtrak passengers.  </li>
            <li>Gilchrist &amp; Soames is completely committed to a cruelty free environment; we NEVER test on animals.</li>

            <li>any one who wants to feel soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;AND, you don&#x27;t need to apply much at all.</li>
            <li>The scent is really what makes it.  </li>
            <li>This performs reasonably well as a body lotion.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into the skin very well and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.</li>
            <li>thing I really don&#x27;t like about this lotion is the scent.</li>
            <li>And it leaves your skin soo soft!!!</li>
            <li>So smooth and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>This is high end lotion that you would find at a spa.</li>

            <li>Its fragrance is so natural - like fresh-cut lemons with sugar sprinkled over them.</li>
            <li>This lotion goes a far way.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Food-grade, naturally derived USP glycerin, natural conditioning agents from honey and the Brassica plant, soybean and cottonseed oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>Then, after using the lotion on my hands for several days, I noticed that itchy, red, dry spots had disappeared and my skin was smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>This product might be more expensive than other competitors, but you get a fantastic product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I generally don&#x27;t like fragranced products (whether of the beauty, laundry, or household cleaning variety).</li>

            <li> My skin feels soft and stays soft for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have bad allergies and can&#x27;t take very many scented lotions.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to use lotion much because I usually break out or react from them.  </li>
            <li> Will be buying it as long as they keep making it.</li>
            <li> This is the nicest lotion I have used in a long time.  </li>
            <li> The honey and brassica extracts may have some antibacterial properties, but you would not want this to sit around on the shelf for a long time since it doesn&#x27;t seem to have preservatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This lotion is now a part of my morning routine to help with the dry winter weather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s complete, though, because there is a fragrance I can&#x27;t account for anywhere in this list:&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an appropriate consistency for a lotion (thin enough to dispense and spread, but not so thin</li>
            <li> As did some of the other reviewers, I was introduced to this lotion at a B&amp;B (the Berry Manor Inn in Rockland, ME).</li>
            <li> the smell is not overpowering like a lot of other lotions.</li>
            <li> Probably wouldn&#x27;t order again due to combination of price and his not liking it.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that this full-size bottle is difficult to squeeze out the right amount of lotion.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of \\&quot;BeeKind Body Lotion\\&quot; (along with BeeKind shampoo and conditioner) in a little bag in a sleeper car on an Amtrak train.  </li>
            <li> I find the smells of these products to be fake and unpleasant at best, and thoroughly disgusting at worst.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I do think it&#x27;s helping to keep them moisturized during a recent cold snap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It loses one star only because it is SO expensive!</li>
            <li> While in Dublin last year I got a bad case of wind burn and needed to use something to sooth my skin.  </li>
            <li> My husband finds it somewhat irritating</li>
            <li> and this has not been irritating (not even after shaving).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> This is just the most luxurious lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried, it smells wonderful and goes on so nicely and dries quickly, no oily feeling!  I really do love it!</li>
            <li> So I got the pleasure of sampling this product one month out of my birchbox. It is great, it smells strongly of lemon and honey. Although perhaps the smell was more than I was expecting initially, I did grow to enjoy it. If you enjoy more citrus smells, you will likely enjoy this. Let&#x27;s talk consistency, it is kind of a medium consistency, (which I am partial to) it isn&#x27;t too runny but it doesn&#x27;t feel like a butter that you have to rub in forever. And it leaves your skin soo soft!!! So this is just a great product all around, but there is another reason I love it. The Gilchrist &amp; Soames company donates a portion of the proceeds of this product (BeeKind) to honey bee&#x27;s and sustainable pollination research! I love that it supports a important cause and that it leaves me feeling soft and smelling good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a big win</li>
            <li> I have bad allergies and can&#x27;t take very many scented lotions.  However, this one is lightly scented, almost a lemon scent.  My skin feels soft and stays soft for a long time.  I&#x27;d gladly but from this seller again.</li>
            <li> The best!!! Non oily great smell....</li>
            <li> I received a sample one time and fell in love! The smell is incredible and it has greatly helped my dry patches on my elbow. I love that this company also donates a portion of the sale to bee research done at UC davis!</li>
            <li> LOOOOVVVVEEEE this lotion! It has a fabulous citrusy scent that qualifies for an any-time &amp;#34;lotion break!&amp;#34; Leaves your skin moisturized without feeling greasy, or slippery.</li>
            <li> Got samples of this in a hotel in Maui and loved it! Smooth, not greasy at all and the smell is not overpowering like a lot of other lotions. Will be buying it as long as they keep making it.</li>
            <li> I have tried many lotions and this one exceeds my expectations. I love all the natural qualities about it and it supports a great cause. It smells so fresh and yummy too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to use lotion much because I usually break out or react from them.  While in Dublin last year I got a bad case of wind burn and needed to use something to sooth my skin.  I tried a sample of this BeeKind lotion and was amazed!  It was soothing, helped my skin feel and look better immediately.  Best of all there is no strong perfume smell to put up with.  This lotion is now a part of my morning routine to help with the dry winter weather.</li>
            <li> OK - had received this product at a nice hotel in the amenity set and liked it - so thought I&#x27;d order it - nice but scent is certainly more fem than not.  My husband finds it somewhat irritating but I still wear it during the day.  Nice product but not for everyone.  Probably wouldn&#x27;t order again due to combination of price and his not liking it.</li>
            <li> Bought this because I really liked the sample I got while riding Amtrak long-distance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that this full-size bottle is difficult to squeeze out the right amount of lotion.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product-so silky and smells fantastic!  Customer service is exceptional.</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling and moisturising lotion. Smells like honey and lemon. It&#x27;s quite light in texture and not greasy.</li>
            <li> This lotion works great to soften my skin and smells so good! I got it in a beauty sample box and became an instant fan.</li>
            <li> This container is even bigger than I thought it would be which means more quality product than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its ingredients are honest and natural, it smell&#x27;s quite neutral yet nice, and it does a fine job moisturizing (especially in the winter). This product might be more expensive than other competitors, but you get a fantastic product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND, you don&#x27;t need to apply much at all. This lotion goes a far way.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. Leaves skin silky smooth and has a very nice scent.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion...found in at The Pollard Motel in Red lodge MT.  This is high end lotion that you would find at a spa. Great price</li>
            <li> This is the nicest lotion I have used in a long time.  The scent is really what makes it.  I  got a sample from a very nice hotel I stayed at.  I used the sample all up and had to have more.</li>
            <li> I first used this at a bed and breakfast and fell in love with the product. It is the only lotion I use now. It is non-greasy and has a nice light smell. Wonderful!</li>
            <li> This performs reasonably well as a body lotion. I use it on my legs and I do think it&#x27;s helping to keep them moisturized during a recent cold snap. It absorbs into the skin very well and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue. It&#x27;s an appropriate consistency for a lotion (thin enough to dispense and spread, but not so thin it&#x27;s runny). I have kind of sensitive skin on my legs and this has not been irritating (not even after shaving).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this ingredients list elsewhere online. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s complete, though, because there is a fragrance I can&#x27;t account for anywhere in this list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Food-grade, naturally derived USP glycerin, natural conditioning agents from honey and the Brassica plant, soybean and cottonseed oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what it&#x27;s worth, Brassica plants are in the mustard family and include turnips, broccoli, etc. This does not smell like any of those things, though! I like the simplicity of the ingredients list. The honey and brassica extracts may have some antibacterial properties, but you would not want this to sit around on the shelf for a long time since it doesn&#x27;t seem to have preservatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing I really don&#x27;t like about this lotion is the scent. It&#x27;s a strong lemongrass scent. If you like lemongrass, this is a great lotion to try. If you&#x27;re not as enthusiastic about it, you may want to avoid this product.</li>
            <li> It has a nice citrus smell and works very well.</li>
            <li> Not as effective as I thought it would be.</li>
