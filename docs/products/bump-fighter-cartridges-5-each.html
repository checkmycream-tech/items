            <li>Excellent product!    </li>
            <li>These are the best blades I have ever used.</li>
            <li>BTW, Amazon has the BEST price on them</li>
            <li>I am a WOMAN and these blades work great on my legs too!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Excellent product!</li>
            <li>I have used this product before and amazon gave me the best price.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s a great hint:</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>The 12 pack of Cartridge blade are a great deal.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Try them, they are great for BOTH MEN AND WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF MANY RACES!!</li>
            <li>as soon as i started to use these blades now i can enjoy shaving with blades again with blades !!!</li>
            <li>Very effective for burn.</li>
            <li>Great product and better yet, great price!</li>
            <li>The handle with replaceable cartridges seems to be better than the disposable but disposables are very good too.    </li>
            <li>The disposable ones are not as good as the replacements</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>THAT&#x27;S FOR SURE!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE BUMP FIGHTER RAZOR BLADES!</li>
            <li>i just love it !</li>
            <li>So pleased that I can order them through Amazon!</li>
            <li>I am happy that these blades are still available.  </li>
            <li>The reason ( I think) that the Persona and Bump Fighter blades are SO GOOD is that the blades are wrapped with a wire going across the blade and that somehow protects the skin from getting knicks most (almost) all the time when shaving.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This is the send time I ordered Bump Fighter razors from Amazon and have been completely satisfied with the ordering process and delivery.  </li>
            <li>Before I found Bump Fighter Cartridge Blades, I used a Depilatory Product (Magic shave) to shave my face.</li>
            <li>Glad I was able to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>the result being that I had ALOT more cuts to my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that someone still sells it.</li>
            <li>Been using them for more than 20 years...</li>
            <li>I get razor burn from most razors, but never from \\&quot;Bump Fighters.\\&quot;    </li>
            <li>use with a GEL sgaving cream like Edge or one of the drugstore copies for a much better and probelm free shave.</li>
            <li>This product is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Great product been using for more than ten yrs.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly the kind of razors I&#x27;ve been looking for.  </li>
            <li>That seemed to work just fine.  </li>
            <li>This product works good for me, since I have sensitive skin on my neck area.  </li>
            <li>thanks to the person that invented this !!!</li>
            <li>this is the only thing that I can use except maybe an electric razor (ie., a good Braun).  </li>
            <li>BF&#x27;s are the only blade that give me consistently good shaving results.</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>They are perfect for African American men or anyone else that has curly hair as these razors reduce and elimnate the presence of razor bumps.</li>
            <li>but, luckily, he told me that what I thought was acne was ingrown hairs caused by shaving too close.</li>
            <li>After my very first shave using Bump Fighter razors, I could tell an immediate difference.</li>
            <li>Some are very sharp and does a great job and others are so-so.</li>
            <li>Very excellent razor good for African American skin prevents bumps from forming by keeping razor slightly off skin.</li>
            <li>The reason it&#x27;s so effective is that the blade doesn&#x27;t actually contact the skin</li>
            <li>I buy them in bulk so that I always have a fresh one when I need one.</li>
            <li>They cost more by the individual pack at CVS or Walgreens if you can find them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I ever would have heard of these great blades if my dermatologist was not black</li>
            <li>burn that you can shave really fast.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!</li>
            <li>This is the only razor I can comfortably use.</li>
            <li>Just as important, American Safety Razor, the manufacturer, does not test products on animals.</li>
            <li>I used to use Persona Double Edged Razor Blades which were made by the same company as Bump Fighters (American Safety Razor Co.) and loved them too.</li>
            <li>These blades may well stop bumps on black men in fact I&#x27;m sure they do.</li>
            <li>you can go over the same area lots of times, that&#x27;s fine as long as you don&#x27;t use to much pressure, and they are so forgiving in terms of nicks and razor</li>
            <li>He spent years searching for the right product!</li>
            <li>Also, I use shaving cream/gel that is for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This process also irritates sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>before bumpfighters, I used double blade razors but they caused much pain and cuts.  </li>
            <li>but electrics take to long, don&#x27;t give nearly as good a shave as these, and are no good when sweaty and grimey.  </li>
            <li>Have used these blades for a few weeks, and my shaving bumps have significantly improved.</li>
            <li>the luxury of finally being able to shave everyday!    </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say from experience because I&#x27;m not black</li>
            <li>You will not shave right down to your skin with these--they are designed so there is a bit of whisker above the skin.</li>
            <li>The razors are hard to find in my area and they are the only razors my husband feel comfortable using.  </li>
            <li>so I can shave up down and across getting a very close shave without burn.</li>
            <li>When I first saw this product I assumed that it was a problem specific blade (bumps)for black men only.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I give these 5 stars easily because they were a cheap way to take care of an annoying problem.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;M A LONG TIME CUSTOMER FOR SEVERAL YEARS!!!</li>
            <li> The package said \\&quot;Bump Fighter\\&quot; I wish it had said Bump and Burn Fighter because I&#x27;d have tried it long before I did.     </li>
            <li> Long ago (before Bump Fighters were made),.</li>
            <li> I buy the 12 packs of 5 blades each and it takes a long time for me to need to recorder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This problem is more common in black men due to their beard growth, which is why you have a black model on the product.</li>
            <li> I am an African American Male in my late 50&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Incidentally, pseudofolliculitis is not unique to people of African descent.</li>
            <li> Since I found out about these maybe 9 years ago I haven&#x27;t used any other razor if I could help it.   </li>
            <li> and I had to use other brands of blades.....</li>
            <li> I have found that these are the only type razors I could use without making my skin break out with ingrown hairs excessively.</li>
            <li> Occasionally, I&#x27;ve fallen for the hoopla around the introduction of new blades from other companies, but they have invariably disappointed me in short order.</li>
            <li> Having somewhat a baby face and very sensitive skin I have tried just about every type of razor available in the hopes of finding one that would help eliminate those nasty in-grown whiskers.</li>
            <li> I have used them for years and have had only a very few knicks over the years!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why they are so hard to find in local stores.</li>
            <li> My skin was not itchy, irritated, or bleeding as has been the case in the past with other razors I have used.</li>
            <li> For those that are not familiar with Depilatory shaving products it is a cream that you apply and scrape off your face and it dissolves the hairs from your face.</li>
            <li> When my skin had a severe reaction from all the harsh chemicals my Dermatologist recommended the Bump Fighter Cartridge razor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This has cleared my face in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> like others have said, I am not African American but have always had bad problems with ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> This razor cartridges were designed for black hair, course and curly--they are almost impossible to find on the open market, thank godness for Amazon, otherwise, I would have razor bumps everywhere!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for over 10 years, at least.</li>
            <li> duh.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easier and less expensive anyway, but I&#x27;d pay three times the price for them.  </li>
            <li> out\\&quot; those irritating bumps and now always me</li>
            <li> FOR THE PRICE I COULD NOT GO WRONG</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever hated shaving, try these!</li>

            <li> This razor cartridges were designed for black hair, course and curly--they are almost impossible to find on the open market, thank godness for Amazon, otherwise, I would have razor bumps everywhere!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for over 10 years, at least. like others have said, I am not African American but have always had bad problems with ingrown hairs.  this is the only thing that I can use except maybe an electric razor (ie., a good Braun).  but electrics take to long, don&#x27;t give nearly as good a shave as these, and are no good when sweaty and grimey.  these shave just close enough without shaving too close to cause ingrown hairs.  you can go over the same area lots of times, that&#x27;s fine as long as you don&#x27;t use to much pressure, and they are so forgiving in terms of nicks and razor burn that you can shave really fast. I can&#x27;t find them in any stores any longer, so I  buy them online.  it&#x27;s easier and less expensive anyway, but I&#x27;d pay three times the price for them.  I hope to God that they never stop making these because my wife hates my hideous gray and red beard.    Here&#x27;s a great hint: use with a GEL sgaving cream like Edge or one of the drugstore copies for a much better and probelm free shave.</li>
            <li> This is the send time I ordered Bump Fighter razors from Amazon and have been completely satisfied with the ordering process and delivery.  This product works good for me, since I have sensitive skin on my neck area.  I was getting razor bumps and the dermatologist recommend going to this razor.  Also, I use shaving cream/gel that is for sensitive skin.  That seemed to work just fine.  The dermatologist initially prescribed a shaving cream called BenzaShave too.</li>
            <li> COULDN&#x27;T BE HAPPIER WITH THE BUMP FIGHTER!! THAT&#x27;S FOR SURE!  I&#x27;M A LONG TIME CUSTOMER FOR SEVERAL YEARS!!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!</li>
            <li> This is exactly the kind of razors I&#x27;ve been looking for.  Great product and better yet, great price!</li>
            <li> Very excellent razor good for African American skin prevents bumps from forming by keeping razor slightly off skin.</li>

After my very first shave using Bump Fighter razors, I could tell an immediate difference. My skin was not itchy, irritated, or bleeding as has been the case in the past with other razors I have used. Bump Fighter \\&quot;knocks out\\&quot; those irritating bumps and now always me the luxury of finally being able to shave everyday!    Excellent product!    RCT</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I am an African American Male in my late 50&#x27;s. Before I found Bump Fighter Cartridge Blades, I used a Depilatory Product (Magic shave) to shave my face. For those that are not familiar with Depilatory shaving products it is a cream that you apply and scrape off your face and it dissolves the hairs from your face. This process also irritates sensitive skin. When my skin had a severe reaction from all the harsh chemicals my Dermatologist recommended the Bump Fighter Cartridge razor.&lt;br /&gt;I use this razor every day in combination with \\&quot;Tend Skin\\&quot; as an after shave. This has cleared my face in a few weeks. The 12 pack of Cartridge blade are a great deal. They cost more by the individual pack at CVS or Walgreens if you can find them. They work for me. If you suffer from Pseudofolliculitis (ingrown beard hair) you should give these a try. They worked for me.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for decades. Only shaver I have used since my initial exposure to them.</li>
            <li> Have used these blades for a few weeks, and my shaving bumps have significantly improved. Very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bump Fighter blades for almost 20 years. Occasionally, I&#x27;ve fallen for the hoopla around the introduction of new blades from other companies, but they have invariably disappointed me in short order. BF&#x27;s are the only blade that give me consistently good shaving results.</li>
            <li> When I first saw this product I assumed that it was a problem specific blade (bumps)for black men only. But then I came across a pack on clearance for next nothing, you know like $1.50 for 3or4 disposables,and since I was out of blades, why not.  These blades may well stop bumps on black men in fact I&#x27;m sure they do. I can&#x27;t say from experience because I&#x27;m not black and I don&#x27;t get bumps. I&#x27;m white and boy do I ever get BURN!! The package said \\&quot;Bump Fighter\\&quot; I wish it had said Bump and Burn Fighter because I&#x27;d have tried it long before I did.     The reason it&#x27;s so effective is that the blade doesn&#x27;t actually contact the skin so I can shave up down and across getting a very close shave without burn. These are the best blades I have ever used. The handle with replaceable cartridges seems to be better than the disposable but disposables are very good too.    Very effective for burn. I would think it would do just as well for bumps for the same reason. No skin contact by blade. ..</li>
            <li> This is the only razor I can comfortably use. None of the local stores ever seem to have enough in stock, always saying \\&quot;we just sold out\\&quot; or \\&quot;we need to order more\\&quot;. no duh. Glad I was able to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Since I found out about these maybe 9 years ago I haven&#x27;t used any other razor if I could help it.   Finally I could shave 2 days in a row without it feeling like somebody tried to sandpaper my face off.  Incidentally, pseudofolliculitis is not unique to people of African descent. If you&#x27;ve ever hated shaving, try these!</li>
            <li> I LOVE BUMP FIGHTER RAZOR BLADES! I have used them for years and have had only a very few knicks over the years! Long ago (before Bump Fighters were made),. I used to use Persona Double Edged Razor Blades which were made by the same company as Bump Fighters (American Safety Razor Co.) and loved them too. But  the company fazed out the Persona blades at some point years ago and I had to use other brands of blades.....the result being that I had ALOT more cuts to my skin. I made it my mission to find a razor blade  with the SAME  features as the Persona blades. The reason ( I think) that the Persona and Bump Fighter blades are SO GOOD is that the blades are wrapped with a wire going across the blade and that somehow protects the skin from getting knicks most (almost) all the time when shaving. BTW, Amazon has the BEST price on them (I checked the web). I buy the 12 packs of 5 blades each and it takes a long time for me to need to recorder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;!! SURPRISE !!  I am a WOMAN and these blades work great on my legs too!!!!!!!!!! Try them, they are great for BOTH MEN AND WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF MANY RACES!!</li>
            <li> This is the only blade he will use and has been a user for some 20  years and he does not have to worry about nicks</li>
            <li> My husband uses only this product.  He spent years searching for the right product!</li>
            <li> I have ordered bump fighters for several years to handle razor bumps caused by ingrown hairs on my neck and chin.  before bumpfighters, I used double blade razors but they caused much pain and cuts.  the bump fighter cartridges are replaceable and they leave my face unscarred and I get a close shave.    I am happy that these blades are still available.  I buy them in bulk so that I always have a fresh one when I need one.</li>
            <li> The razors are hard to find in my area and they are the only razors my husband feel comfortable using.  They arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I&#x27;m glad that someone still sells it.</li>
            <li> These are the only razors I use and hopefully will ever use.  They are perfect for African American men or anyone else that has curly hair as these razors reduce and elimnate the presence of razor bumps.</li>
            <li> Arrived in 2 or 3 days. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> I have found that these are the only type razors I could use without making my skin break out with ingrown hairs excessively. Unfortunately these are not sold any more locally, so Amazon to the rescue!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I ever would have heard of these great blades if my dermatologist was not black but, luckily, he told me that what I thought was acne was ingrown hairs caused by shaving too close. This problem is more common in black men due to their beard growth, which is why you have a black model on the product. Anyway, I give these 5 stars easily because they were a cheap way to take care of an annoying problem.  NOTE: You will not shave right down to your skin with these--they are designed so there is a bit of whisker above the skin. That means you have to shave again if you&#x27;re going out at night, but you probably do that now anyway.</li>
            <li> They serve their purpose. Been using them for more than 20 years... However, it took almost 3 weeks to receive them</li>
            <li> Great product been using for more than ten yrs.  If you are a guy that is prone to razor bumps this is the product to use to avoid them.</li>
            <li> I get razor burn from most razors, but never from \\&quot;Bump Fighters.\\&quot;    Just as important, American Safety Razor, the manufacturer, does not test products on animals.</li>
            <li> FOR THE PRICE I COULD NOT GO WRONG</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and amazon gave me the best price. This product is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> i needed this product because i get a lot of bumps. as soon as i started to use these blades now i can enjoy shaving with blades again with blades !!! i just love it ! thanks to the person that invented this !!!</li>
            <li> Bump fighter blades are a hit and miss. Some are very sharp and does a great job and others are so-so. i still recommend for people with hair bumps. I&#x27;m not sure why they are so hard to find in local stores. The disposable ones are not as good as the replacements</li>
            <li> Great product. So pleased that I can order them through Amazon!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Works for anyone with coarse hair that tends to get ingrown under the skin. I had bumps and razor burn all along my neck until I started using these razors.</li>
