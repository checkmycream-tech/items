            <li> Nice thick towels for a day spa.</li>
            <li> These towels are perfect size and texture.  Bought 2 dozen to test them out and we will order again.  They are especially great for our long hair ladies to wrap up after a shampoo.</li>
            <li> For the price, these are great quality. Especially for being used as gym towels. After washing and drying, some shrinkage occurred, but overall happy with the purchase and would recommend them.</li>
            <li> These towels are of poor quality.  Thus, they cost less.  Trust me.  You get what you pay for with towels.  These towels are now being used as my rag towels, and they are great for cleaning.  I ended up  buying the Utopia 20&amp;#34; by 40&amp;#34; towels, and they are great! Now my kids don&#x27;t use a huge towel for their hair. They help with laundry time, and who doesn&#x27;t need help with laundry!</li>
            <li> I use these cotton towels in the kitchen for drying dishes.  The towels are perfect&lt;br /&gt;size, and very absorbent.  I highly recommend these Salon towels for any application&lt;br /&gt;that they are chosen for.</li>
