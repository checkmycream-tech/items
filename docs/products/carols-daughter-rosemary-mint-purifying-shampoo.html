    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>ISNT THE GREATEST</li>
            <li>THIS IS GREAT!</li>
            <li>I am quite impressed and would recommend it to anyone.    </li>
            <li>I was given this product as a gift and have been very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>I use this in conjunction with CD Lisa&#x27;s Hair Elixir and I am one happy nappy girl!</li>
            <li>Carols Daughter do have some real good hair products, however this one was not for me.</li>
            <li>My hair and scalp feels great after shampooing (I have itchy flaky scalp) and I either use the smoothie to replace any moisture loss or the leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy I gave it another try.</li>
            <li>This shampoo works great on both types of my hair.</li>
            <li>This product is great for detangling.</li>
            <li>The good thing about it is the smell.</li>
            <li>Some good products to use is the Mimosa Hair Honey.</li>
            <li>For years I&#x27;d heard about CD products and how good they were but could never afford the price.</li>
            <li>The smell of the shampoo was great, and I liked the fact that it tingled my itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo lathered when i applied it and made my scalp tingle which is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see how Jada got good results with this shampoo and conditioner as she has alot of hair as well.</li>
            <li>It took me two washes to get a good lather.</li>
            <li>I was very excited when I received this shampoo because I have heard great things about it.</li>
            <li>This shampoo drips out like an oil, but lathers up so nicely.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The fragrance of the shampoo and conditioner were nice.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather much at all, but works incredibly to moisturize and detangle my hair.</li>
            <li>The best thing about the product (which is why I gave it a \\&quot;2\\&quot;) was the smell and tingly feeling on the scalp (I also used the shampoo and didn&#x27;t like my results either - I had to pull out my old shampoo to wash out the CD product).  </li>
            <li>My hair feels so clean and smells good afterwards</li>
            <li>It has worked wonders on my scalp and and is very good at moisturizing my natural hair.  </li>
            <li>but I love the smell and the sheen that I get after drying (with rollers).</li>
            <li>This works better than any clarifying shampoo I have ever used.</li>
            <li>We as people of color need a better solution.</li>
            <li>Although there are so many stars promoting this product line, this may just be a gimmick.</li>
            <li>This review was \\&quot;Made with Love.</li>
            <li>And I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I love the smell</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this shampoo.</li>
            <li>So when I tried to comb my hair, it was more tangled than ever.  </li>
            <li>I had to take off the \\&quot;spray\\&quot; top of the conditioner and basically pour it on my hair to help me comb the tangles out.  </li>
            <li>I have had better results with the Khoret Amen shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t penetrate well; it just sat on top of my hair.  </li>
            <li>Most shampoos (even ones that shouldn&#x27;t) seem to strip my hair of it&#x27;s moisture.  </li>
            <li>This worked out so much better.</li>
            <li>( that is if you love your dog)  </li>
            <li>I love Carols Daughter products.</li>
            <li>glad</li>
            <li>The mint makes my scalp tingle, which I love.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard alot about CD&#x27;s products and was very excited about trying them myself and for my daughters.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a pretty good shampoo.</li>
            <li>Well, it lathers up riht away, is easy to come out of the bottle, smells refreshing and minty, which lifted my spirits.</li>
            <li>The results for me are great and you can&#x27;t even tell the relaxed from natural.  </li>
            <li>My hair and scalp felt clean and tingly (from the mint, I&#x27;m sure)</li>
            <li>The results were smooth, soft, great smelling hair.</li>
            <li>and I do find that with this shampoo those ends become tangled, while the rest of my hair is so easy to comb through.  </li>
            <li>My hair is still easily tangled with or without this product.</li>
            <li>I had to rewash my hair with my usual stuff, the Optimum shampoo line, which is cheaper and works great w/</li>
            <li>my fine, shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li>I also use the hair milk which is recommended for curly hair but works great as a light weight daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>but I relax my own hair with dudley&#x27;s gentle treatment-regular.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s important to use the product line.</li>
            <li>I had to put a great deal of her moisturized and flat iron strand by strand to get it manageable!!!</li>
            <li>I too was excited when I purchased this product from Sephora.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather, which took some getting used to, but my hair still felt and looked clean when I was done.</li>
            <li>it clean shiny ppl w/</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving the product and the smell, what a nice change from all the other &#x27;dandruff&#x27; shampoos i have used.  </li>
            <li>AND IT MAKES IT NICE AND SOFT.</li>
            <li>but the second one worked good.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other Carol&#x27;s Daughter products, and have been very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Even though I love most of Carol&#x27;s daughter products this shampoo left my hair tangled and matted up.</li>
            <li>Luckily I got through this wash</li>
            <li>After towel drying my hair, my scalp was flake free for the first time in my life.  </li>
            <li>Someone had advised it would be good for my scalp which was dry and itchy from years of relaxing.</li>
            <li>My hair is never stiff and I love the bounce and shine.</li>
            <li>In fact, I was surprised that my hair seemed even more tangled.  </li>
            <li>I heard the scrub works wonders at leaving your skin soft.  : )</li>
            <li>Her hair is natural and it brought her curls out and made it more manageable.  </li>
            <li>I would have expected more from the company who&#x27;s product states &#x27;Made with Love, Peace&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Plus I love the thought of using natural ingredients...makes me feel safer.</li>
            <li>bad\\&quot; (i had to laugh)</li>
            <li>So I ended up with nicely scented, tangled, dry hair.</li>
            <li>But when I finally chopped all the relaxed hair off, I fell in love.</li>
            <li>This is my first time ever reviewing a product</li>
            <li>I first noticed that as I was shampooing it wasn&#x27;t lathering.</li>
            <li>My first time using it, I almost cried.</li>
            <li>Once I rinsed it out, I didnt comb my hair, but used a hot oil treatment to untangle my hair.</li>
            <li>it made my hair feel much more coarse than it was and matted my hair.</li>
            <li>the lathering prob first wash w/ another shampoo to get excess oil out then proceed  with carols daughter  </li>
            <li>I was first introduced to Carol&#x27;s Daughter after watching The Tyra show w/ Jada Pinkett and Mary J.</li>
            <li>I have used other conditioning shampoos such as Organic Root Stimulator Olive Oil Shampoo and Pantene (for relaxed/natural hair), and by far those are better and CHEAPER!!!</li>
            <li>So I called Sephora and they resent me a new one that was totally a different color and worked much better.</li>
            <li>so I alternate between both of them which ever is available.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li>I used the hair milk as well, although i didn&#x27;t really see a change with my hair as when i use my olive oil moisturizing lotion...</li>
            <li>I broke so much of my hair off trying to detangle it.  </li>
            <li>I was very dissapointed when I tried this product.  </li>
            <li>I combed my hair out and it came out so much.</li>
            <li>The Rosemary and Mint do not offer a gentle tingle or scalp stimulation at all.</li>
            <li>AND IT COMES OUT SOFT AS COTTON!!!  </li>
            <li>But I can speak for my natural hair, and it LOVES this shampoo!!!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone, not even my sister who is sporting a natural right now.</li>
            <li>I have found that I need to use a bit more leave in conditioner than with other lines</li>
            <li>My hair is of fine texture, long, and relaxed.</li>
            <li>Initially, I was a bit weirded out by the lack of lather but quickly got over that</li>
            <li>Take notice--most positive reviews are written by women with NATURAL hair.</li>
            <li>I started not to use, but thought better since I paid a little money for this.....</li>
            <li>I have recommended Carols Daughter to all my friends and even to my new hairdresser (she has dreads)</li>
            <li>While doing my hair my mom came in the bathroom and said \\&quot;that is diffrent hair products youre using because that new scent smells</li>
            <li>My hair is very easy to manage, but with this stuff it make is hard to comb.</li>
            <li>Use this shampoo first, then follow up up with your regular shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair is past my shoulders and healthy.  </li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t moisturize as much as I would like it too but works decent enough.</li>
            <li>then I rewashed, 2 more times, eventually getting lather, but her hair started to cling together and become tight-spongelike; and it was really hard to comb out.</li>
            <li>I saw a review from another woman with relaxed hair who said that it tangled her hair and stripped it of its natural moisture.</li>
            <li>I truly believe that the founder of this company should state on her website that her products are for people who wear their hair NATURAL, instead of women with relaxed hair wasting their time and money on her products.</li>
            <li>I washed my hair once with this product and my hair turned into a bird&#x27;s nest that felt as if all of its natural moisture was gone--basically my hair turned into a brillo pad.</li>
            <li>It lathers and cleanses my hair without stripping the natural oils; it soothes my scalp, detangles and moisturizes.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and it detangled well enough for me.</li>
            <li>I followed with the Pantene relaxed and natural breakage defense hair mask, Khoret Amen leave-in conditioner, KA hair oil, and CD hair.  </li>
            <li>but I felt I needed to share how this product brought my hair alive.  </li>
            <li>I felt like it stripped all the natural moisture from my hair.  </li>
            <li>I wear my hair natural</li>
            <li>It also keeps my hair soft and managable after it is relaxed.</li>
            <li>(My natural hair is 3c/4a - soft, tightish spirals).  </li>
            <li>After watching the show i decided to use it because it is an all natural line of ethnic hair products (#1 must for me)</li>
            <li>and I immediately but it far away from my eye sight.</li>
            <li>I have been trying to go natural</li>
            <li>As many other people have said, it made my hair more tangled and difficult to comb.</li>
            <li>Wanting a fresh start with my new style, I decided to give CD a try and sacrificed some dough for the Rosemary Mint Herbal Shampoo(detangling formula), the Khoret Amen Leave-in Conditioner(normal-dry), and the Black Vanilla Leave-in Conditioner(dry)</li>
            <li>I am so happy I was wrong!  </li>
            <li>I first tried this shampoo when I was transitioning from relaxed/chemically straightened hair to my natural, unprocessed hair.</li>
            <li>I wear it quite long, so I really wanted to keep the length.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I just wanted to clarify the issue that a lot of other people had with lathering.</li>
            <li>You just have to be patient and find the right thing that works for your hair (especially if you are natural, believe me, I have been down that road and have tried TONS of products) and this one works for me.</li>
            <li>As far as my relaxed hair goes, I don&#x27;t find it necessary to buy a clarifying shampoo anymore.  </li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t; it left both my hair types moisturized and and incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li>I also use the products on my kids naturally curly hair (theirs is finer than mine) and FINALLY there is a product that keeps their hair shiny all day.  </li>
            <li>The smell is tolerable, but barely.  </li>
            <li>I am transitioning from relaxed to natural hair and have about 3 1/2 inches of relaxed ends left</li>
            <li>I quit there and switched back to my olive oil conditioning shampoo with aloe and lo and behold, my hair went back to normal.</li>
            <li>Then when I went to go blow dry my hair using the black vanilla leave in coditioner, I noticed my HAIR WAS DRY, BRITTLE AND VERY TANGELED! ! ! !</li>
            <li>I normally used Dove Mosturizing shampoo and conditioner and blow dry my hair WITHOUT ANY MOSTURIZER</li>
            <li>I stopped relaxing my hair a few years ago and have found that my natural hair texture consists mostly of VERY tight coils (which tangle easily).</li>
            <li>In other words I went from someone with shoulder length hair to almost a bald head (actually I was bald in certain spots and had to use what hair I had left to cover those spots).     </li>
            <li>It detangles my natural kinky dry hair, and leaves it moisturized.</li>

            <li> So I ended up with nicely scented, tangled, dry hair.</li>
            <li> But when I finally chopped all the relaxed hair off, I fell in love.</li>
            <li> This is my first time ever reviewing a product</li>
            <li> I first noticed that as I was shampooing it wasn&#x27;t lathering.</li>
            <li> My first time using it, I almost cried.</li>
            <li> Once I rinsed it out, I didnt comb my hair, but used a hot oil treatment to untangle my hair.</li>
            <li> it made my hair feel much more coarse than it was and matted my hair.</li>
            <li> the lathering prob first wash w/ another shampoo to get excess oil out then proceed  with carols daughter  </li>
            <li> I was first introduced to Carol&#x27;s Daughter after watching The Tyra show w/ Jada Pinkett and Mary J.</li>
            <li> I have used other conditioning shampoos such as Organic Root Stimulator Olive Oil Shampoo and Pantene (for relaxed/natural hair), and by far those are better and CHEAPER!!!</li>
            <li> So I called Sephora and they resent me a new one that was totally a different color and worked much better.</li>
            <li> so I alternate between both of them which ever is available.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> I used the hair milk as well, although i didn&#x27;t really see a change with my hair as when i use my olive oil moisturizing lotion...</li>
            <li> I broke so much of my hair off trying to detangle it.  </li>
            <li> I was very dissapointed when I tried this product.  </li>
            <li> I combed my hair out and it came out so much.</li>
            <li> The Rosemary and Mint do not offer a gentle tingle or scalp stimulation at all.</li>
            <li> AND IT COMES OUT SOFT AS COTTON!!!  </li>
            <li> But I can speak for my natural hair, and it LOVES this shampoo!!!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone, not even my sister who is sporting a natural right now.</li>
            <li> I have found that I need to use a bit more leave in conditioner than with other lines</li>
            <li> My hair is of fine texture, long, and relaxed.</li>
            <li> Initially, I was a bit weirded out by the lack of lather but quickly got over that</li>
            <li> Take notice--most positive reviews are written by women with NATURAL hair.</li>
            <li> I started not to use, but thought better since I paid a little money for this.....</li>
            <li> I have recommended Carols Daughter to all my friends and even to my new hairdresser (she has dreads)</li>
            <li> While doing my hair my mom came in the bathroom and said \\&quot;that is diffrent hair products youre using because that new scent smells</li>
            <li> My hair is very easy to manage, but with this stuff it make is hard to comb.</li>
            <li> Use this shampoo first, then follow up up with your regular shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair is past my shoulders and healthy.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t moisturize as much as I would like it too but works decent enough.</li>
            <li> then I rewashed, 2 more times, eventually getting lather, but her hair started to cling together and become tight-spongelike; and it was really hard to comb out.</li>
            <li> I saw a review from another woman with relaxed hair who said that it tangled her hair and stripped it of its natural moisture.</li>
            <li> I truly believe that the founder of this company should state on her website that her products are for people who wear their hair NATURAL, instead of women with relaxed hair wasting their time and money on her products.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair once with this product and my hair turned into a bird&#x27;s nest that felt as if all of its natural moisture was gone--basically my hair turned into a brillo pad.</li>
            <li> It lathers and cleanses my hair without stripping the natural oils; it soothes my scalp, detangles and moisturizes.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and it detangled well enough for me.</li>
            <li> I followed with the Pantene relaxed and natural breakage defense hair mask, Khoret Amen leave-in conditioner, KA hair oil, and CD hair.  </li>
            <li> but I felt I needed to share how this product brought my hair alive.  </li>
            <li> I felt like it stripped all the natural moisture from my hair.  </li>
            <li> I wear my hair natural</li>
            <li> It also keeps my hair soft and managable after it is relaxed.</li>
            <li> (My natural hair is 3c/4a - soft, tightish spirals).  </li>
            <li> After watching the show i decided to use it because it is an all natural line of ethnic hair products (#1 must for me)</li>
            <li> and I immediately but it far away from my eye sight.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to go natural</li>
            <li> As many other people have said, it made my hair more tangled and difficult to comb.</li>
            <li> Wanting a fresh start with my new style, I decided to give CD a try and sacrificed some dough for the Rosemary Mint Herbal Shampoo(detangling formula), the Khoret Amen Leave-in Conditioner(normal-dry), and the Black Vanilla Leave-in Conditioner(dry)</li>
            <li> I am so happy I was wrong!  </li>
            <li> I first tried this shampoo when I was transitioning from relaxed/chemically straightened hair to my natural, unprocessed hair.</li>
            <li> I wear it quite long, so I really wanted to keep the length.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I just wanted to clarify the issue that a lot of other people had with lathering.</li>
            <li> You just have to be patient and find the right thing that works for your hair (especially if you are natural, believe me, I have been down that road and have tried TONS of products) and this one works for me.</li>
            <li> As far as my relaxed hair goes, I don&#x27;t find it necessary to buy a clarifying shampoo anymore.  </li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t; it left both my hair types moisturized and and incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li> I also use the products on my kids naturally curly hair (theirs is finer than mine) and FINALLY there is a product that keeps their hair shiny all day.  </li>
            <li> The smell is tolerable, but barely.  </li>
            <li> I am transitioning from relaxed to natural hair and have about 3 1/2 inches of relaxed ends left</li>
            <li> I quit there and switched back to my olive oil conditioning shampoo with aloe and lo and behold, my hair went back to normal.</li>
            <li> Then when I went to go blow dry my hair using the black vanilla leave in coditioner, I noticed my HAIR WAS DRY, BRITTLE AND VERY TANGELED! ! ! !</li>
            <li> I normally used Dove Mosturizing shampoo and conditioner and blow dry my hair WITHOUT ANY MOSTURIZER</li>
            <li> I stopped relaxing my hair a few years ago and have found that my natural hair texture consists mostly of VERY tight coils (which tangle easily).</li>
            <li> In other words I went from someone with shoulder length hair to almost a bald head (actually I was bald in certain spots and had to use what hair I had left to cover those spots).     </li>
            <li> It detangles my natural kinky dry hair, and leaves it moisturized.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical because it looks like pure oil.  </li>
            <li> For those of you concerned about the low sudsing quality, I recommended shampooing first with a deep cleasner to remove any heavy oils and other products before shampooing with Khoret Amen.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo claims to be for dry hair and detangling but it actually made my hair drier and extra tangled.</li>
            <li> No thick, creamy conditioner that you can leave in your hair for a few minutes, then wash out.  </li>
            <li> I got the Khoret mainly for my daughter who has a relaxer and the Black vanilla for me since my hair is very dry.  </li>
            <li> However, it didn&#x27;t later well (which I was told at the store when I bought it), and it made my hair feel dry.  </li>
            <li> it works on my daughters dry coarse hair it helps it grow leaves</li>
            <li> I have very dry coarse hair.</li>
            <li> that is about 15\\&quot; long).  </li>
            <li> Lastly, my hair felt rough and unclean.  </li>
            <li> After reading these reviews, you people must keep in mind that, as with any other hair product(s), this product does not cater to all hair types, and NO specific line of hair products works with ALL hair types, lol...DUH.</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair and have suffered from dry scalp for quite some time.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered from dry scalp(seborric dermatitis) all my life and used all sorts of products from t-gel, to nizoral, to kera-care to apple cider vinegar.  </li>
            <li> My hair is not damaged, but always dry.</li>
            <li> I used it because it said it was for dry hair, which I purchased for my daugther.  </li>
            <li> and she is of mixed race and has thin wavy hair which she blows out straight</li>
            <li> but unfortunetley that cannot be because I only use black hair care and other lines that works terrific.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m growing out my relaxer, so I have half relaxed hair and half natural hair.</li>
            <li> I actually let her wear her hair down this weekend, which she</li>
            <li> I tried it with the Tui Hair Smoothie and the ahir smoothie left my hair a greasy mess.</li>
            <li> but it tangled my hair and took at least 3 applications for a complete lather.</li>
            <li> I ordered from their website and spent $60 on products.</li>
            <li> I use a spritz of the leave-in conditioner and a dollop of the elixer daily to tame both their heads (boy &amp; girl).</li>
            <li> In order to get her hair from being so spongy (tight and very stiff), I had to use her old shampoo, which worked.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use again because they didn&#x27;t live up to their claim--at least not on my hair!</li>
            <li> Sodium laurel sulfate is a chemical that causes lather, but it is extremely drying to the hair.</li>
            <li> I have met other people who swear by the product as well, just bear in mind that not all products work for everyone and not everything in one line will work for you.</li>
            <li> I have always had to use other shampoos and conditioner to go along with this hair care line.</li>
            <li> I had to take OTC pain medication twice a day for three days just to help me sleep at night due to the pain.</li>
            <li> It probably not designed for people with relaxed hair (judging from the other reviews).</li>
            <li> It felt very rough.</li>
            <li> I only used half of what i usually use (infusium 21).  </li>
            <li> Unlike some of the other reviews, I will say that I am black and</li>
            <li> This shampoo does wonders with detangling may hair, which is thick and coarse!</li>
            <li> and I used almost half a bottle trying to get it to lather.</li>
            <li> I got this product along with the hair milk and leave in black vanilla conditioner.</li>
            <li> I followed up with the black vanilla leave-in conditioner</li>
            <li> I washed it that night and woke up the next morning in serious pain.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want women with relaxed hair using this product and then breaking their hair off trying to detangle the mess.</li>
            <li> My hair was a mess afterwards.</li>
            <li> I got this item from Sephora and when I put it in my hair it made it a tangles mess.</li>
            <li> would not recommended this for someone with long thick hair like mine.  </li>
            <li> I used the shampoo, which smells nice but is HORRIBLE for my hair.</li>
            <li> Instead of detangling my hair and imparting moisture as is advertised, my hair was a tangled mess!  </li>
            <li> but my hair is really thick with tight coils.</li>
            <li> Everything about these products are fake especially those testimonials on the website.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if CD has samples of all their products, but they should.</li>
            <li> Unlike the results from the rosemary mint shampoo, my hair was no more thangled than ususal</li>
            <li> The aroma of the Leave in conditoner is not enjoyable.</li>
            <li> My hair was so hard and tangled.</li>
            <li> My hair felt so hard and tangled.</li>
            <li> It has made my hair dull, lifeless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and gloppy, and hard to get out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I dont think this is meant for thick hair.</li>
            <li> After the first wash, I was shocked and thought I had done something wrong as there was no lather....</li>
            <li> I washed my hair today with the product and it not only smells bad</li>
            <li> I thought I was the only one whom had a bad experience with this product,</li>
            <li> I agree with the majority of the posts that said that this product was not good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few of the CD&#x27;s products - this one by far is the worst.  </li>
            <li> Then I read the reviews here about how horrible the shampoo is and was pretty scared of what I would get.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I found a Carols Daughters product I do not love.</li>
            <li> Second of all, I am very disappointed by this shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair was left matted with a disgusting film over it.  </li>
            <li> It calls itself a \\&quot;detangler\\&quot; which I desperately needed--it  didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It is still stuck in my hair like an awful wax, or a really harsh hair product.</li>
            <li> I have been using Carol&#x27;s Daughter products for over a year now since I had a bad experience at my hairdresser and lost 8-10 inches of hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch or not</li>
            <li> Once again, I am extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair, and was thoroughly disappointed with this CD product.  </li>
            <li> I used this shampoo this morning and I was extremely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed with that as well.  </li>
            <li> but, I hate how it tangles my hair since on the bottle</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Well, it was horrible on the relaxed ends of my hair; it tangled everything</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed!  </li>
            <li> However, this shampoo is awful.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo was the worst i ever used!</li>
            <li> I had an awful experience with this product...........</li>
            <li> This stuff is AWFUL!  </li>
            <li> Come to find out, it is the worst products that I used.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> First of all, I just wanted to clarify the issue that a lot of other people had with lathering. The reason why this shampoo does not lather is because it does not contain sodium laurel sulfate. Sodium laurel sulfate is a chemical that causes lather, but it is extremely drying to the hair. Second of all, I am very disappointed by this shampoo. As many other people have said, it made my hair more tangled and difficult to comb. Once again, I am extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have been using Carol&#x27;s Daughter products for over a year now since I had a bad experience at my hairdresser and lost 8-10 inches of hair. In other words I went from someone with shoulder length hair to almost a bald head (actually I was bald in certain spots and had to use what hair I had left to cover those spots).     Unlike some of the other reviews, I will say that I am black and I do perm/relax my hair and color as well. After my fiasco with the hair dresser I was looking for something that would help me grow back my hair and I happened on Carol&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s website and called their Harlem office and was advised to use the Khoret Amen line (shampoo, leave in conditioner, hair oil and smoothie).     I have since found that I like the smell of the Rosemary Mint Shampoo so I alternate between both of them which ever is available. I do not have a problem with tangling nor stripping of oils. My hair and scalp feels great after shampooing (I have itchy flaky scalp) and I either use the smoothie to replace any moisture loss or the leave in conditioner. I have found that I need to use a bit more leave in conditioner than with other lines but I love the smell and the sheen that I get after drying (with rollers). My hair is never stiff and I love the bounce and shine. I have recommended Carols Daughter to all my friends and even to my new hairdresser (she has dreads) and she loves it.     I have met other people who swear by the product as well, just bear in mind that not all products work for everyone and not everything in one line will work for you. My daughter does not like the product and she is of mixed race and has thin wavy hair which she blows out straight, she prefers Garnier, but I can&#x27;t say enough about this line. It works for me.</li>
            <li> I THINK THE PRODCUT IS AN ALRIGHT PRODUCT, THE SMELL ISNT THE GREATEST BUT IT DETANGLES MY HAIR AND IT MAKES IT NICE AND SOFT.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical because it looks like pure oil.  I didn&#x27;t expect a lather either.  I am so happy I was wrong!  This shampoo drips out like an oil, but lathers up so nicely.  I didn&#x27;t have to wash my daughter&#x27;s hair a second time.  Once was plenty.  As far as my relaxed hair goes, I don&#x27;t find it necessary to buy a clarifying shampoo anymore.  This works better than any clarifying shampoo I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair today with the product and it not only smells bad but it tangled my hair and took at least 3 applications for a complete lather. We as people of color need a better solution. I thought this was it but it&#x27;s not. Beware! Although there are so many stars promoting this product line, this may just be a gimmick.</li>
            <li> Everything about these products are fake especially those testimonials on the website. The good thing about it is the smell. My hair is very easy to manage, but with this stuff it make is hard to comb. It does not detangle a thing, only make it tangled.I have always had to use other shampoos and conditioner to go along with this hair care line. It is a crime shame that someone has marketed a products for us, only to make money, and damage our hair in the process.</li>
            <li> My hair is of fine texture, long, and relaxed. I used the shampoo, which smells nice but is HORRIBLE for my hair. I have used other conditioning shampoos such as Organic Root Stimulator Olive Oil Shampoo and Pantene (for relaxed/natural hair), and by far those are better and CHEAPER!!! I saw a review from another woman with relaxed hair who said that it tangled her hair and stripped it of its natural moisture. I thought \\&quot;Well, maybe it&#x27;s just her.\\&quot; It&#x27;s not. I truly believe that the founder of this company should state on her website that her products are for people who wear their hair NATURAL, instead of women with relaxed hair wasting their time and money on her products. Take notice--most positive reviews are written by women with NATURAL hair. I washed my hair once with this product and my hair turned into a bird&#x27;s nest that felt as if all of its natural moisture was gone--basically my hair turned into a brillo pad. I quit there and switched back to my olive oil conditioning shampoo with aloe and lo and behold, my hair went back to normal. I don&#x27;t want women with relaxed hair using this product and then breaking their hair off trying to detangle the mess. DO NOT BUY. This review was \\&quot;Made with Love. Peace.\\&quot; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I first tried this shampoo when I was transitioning from relaxed/chemically straightened hair to my natural, unprocessed hair. Someone had advised it would be good for my scalp which was dry and itchy from years of relaxing. Well, it was horrible on the relaxed ends of my hair; it tangled everything and I used almost half a bottle trying to get it to lather. There are several Carol&#x27;s Daughter products that work well on unrelaxed hair, but this isn&#x27;t one of them. But when I finally chopped all the relaxed hair off, I fell in love. THIS IS GREAT! It lathers and cleanses my hair without stripping the natural oils; it soothes my scalp, detangles and moisturizes. And I love the smell. I&#x27;m happy I gave it another try.</li>
            <li> Even though I love most of Carol&#x27;s daughter products this shampoo left my hair tangled and matted up. Some good products to use is the Mimosa Hair Honey.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;d heard about CD products and how good they were but could never afford the price. I just recently took apart my (dread)locs after over 7 years and used a botanical texturizer on my hair.  Wanting a fresh start with my new style, I decided to give CD a try and sacrificed some dough for the Rosemary Mint Herbal Shampoo(detangling formula), the Khoret Amen Leave-in Conditioner(normal-dry), and the Black Vanilla Leave-in Conditioner(dry). I got the Khoret mainly for my daughter who has a relaxer and the Black vanilla for me since my hair is very dry.  I love the smell but it didn&#x27;t seem to moisturize well at all.  The shampoo, well I put it on and rinsed it out 3 times in attempts to get a lather which never happened. I even checked the bottle to see if  it mentioned that it was a latherless shampoo.  It didn&#x27;t say.  It calls itself a \\&quot;detangler\\&quot; which I desperately needed--it  didn&#x27;t. In fact, I was surprised that my hair seemed even more tangled.  My hair and scalp felt clean and tingly (from the mint, I&#x27;m sure) but that&#x27;s about all. I&#x27;m not sure if CD has samples of all their products, but they should. I&#x27;ve paid $23(not including S&amp;H) for products I won&#x27;t use again because they didn&#x27;t live up to their claim--at least not on my hair! The search continues but I will definitely ask for samples from now on!</li>
            <li> I got this product along with the hair milk and leave in black vanilla conditioner. Then I read the reviews here about how horrible the shampoo is and was pretty scared of what I would get. Well, it lathers up riht away, is easy to come out of the bottle, smells refreshing and minty, which lifted my spirits. I think it&#x27;s a pretty good shampoo. I have very curly hair and it detangled well enough for me.</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair and have suffered from dry scalp for quite some time.  I&#x27;ve tried everything and nothing seemed to work.  Carol&#x27;s Daugheter Rosemary Mint Herbal shampoo and Tui intensive conditioner did the trick.  I also use the hair milk which is recommended for curly hair but works great as a light weight daily moisturizer.  I am quite impressed and would recommend it to anyone.    Update: Returned rosemary mint shampoo because it did not lather.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t lather much at all, but works incredibly to moisturize and detangle my hair. I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> I agree with the majority of the posts that said that this product was not good.  I too was excited when I purchased this product from Sephora.  They said I can bring it back if I didn&#x27;t like it... so I will.  The smell of the shampoo was great, and I liked the fact that it tingled my itchy scalp.  However, it didn&#x27;t later well (which I was told at the store when I bought it), and it made my hair feel dry.  Carol&#x27;s daughter only has a \\&quot;leave-in\\&quot; conditioner to use after shampooing.  No thick, creamy conditioner that you can leave in your hair for a few minutes, then wash out.  So when I tried to comb my hair, it was more tangled than ever.  (I am bi-racial with hair that is about 15\\&quot; long).  I had to take off the \\&quot;spray\\&quot; top of the conditioner and basically pour it on my hair to help me comb the tangles out.  I will not be recommending this shampoo to anyone.  I&#x27;ll stick with Mizani, KeraCare, or even Panteen from the beauty supply.    Not to say that all their products are garbage... but the shampoo is.  I&#x27;ll be taking back the shampoo &amp; leave-in conditioner ($23 total), and get the Almond Cookie body scrub ($25).  I heard the scrub works wonders at leaving your skin soft.  : )</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair, and was thoroughly disappointed with this CD product.  My hair was left matted with a disgusting film over it.  I have had better results with the Khoret Amen shampoo.  Unlike the results from the rosemary mint shampoo, my hair was no more thangled than ususal and it did not feel greasy.   For those of you concerned about the low sudsing quality, I recommended shampooing first with a deep cleasner to remove any heavy oils and other products before shampooing with Khoret Amen.  I followed with the Pantene relaxed and natural breakage defense hair mask, Khoret Amen leave-in conditioner, KA hair oil, and CD hair.  The results were smooth, soft, great smelling hair.</li>
            <li> This is my first time ever reviewing a product but I felt I needed to share how this product brought my hair alive.  I will admit, I ordered the product from HSN, which is cheaper because you get the shampoo, conditioner and hair milk for 24.00.  I was scared to use it on my \\&quot;relaxed\\&quot; hair because of the reviews but decided to try it anyway.  I have suffered from dry scalp(seborric dermatitis) all my life and used all sorts of products from t-gel, to nizoral, to kera-care to apple cider vinegar.  Since this shampoo removes all the unecessary oils from your hair, I used this product before my regualr shampoo.  The shampoo lathered when i applied it and made my scalp tingle which is a good thing.  After I rinsed it out, I used my regular shampoo(suave damage care) and it lathered like never before.  I followed up with Suave conditioner.  After towel drying my hair, my scalp was flake free for the first time in my life.  I could actually comb my hair without having to drown my hair with leave in-conditioner.  I only used half of what i usually use (infusium 21).  Blow drying was a breeze, and my hair had a shine to it so I don&#x27;t think I will have to add any oil to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe if you have relaxed hair, follow the steps I did.  Use this shampoo first, then follow up up with your regular shampoo and conditioner. I&#x27;m loving the product and the smell, what a nice change from all the other &#x27;dandruff&#x27; shampoos i have used.  I don&#x27;t know what my hair type is but I relax my own hair with dudley&#x27;s gentle treatment-regular.  My hair is past my shoulders and healthy.  Hope this helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note...I used the hair milk as well, although i didn&#x27;t really see a change with my hair as when i use my olive oil moisturizing lotion...It worked wonders on my daughter&#x27;s hair.  Her hair is natural and it brought her curls out and made it more manageable.  I actually let her wear her hair down this weekend, which she loved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kudos to Carol&#x27;s daughter</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard alot about CD&#x27;s products and was very excited about trying them myself and for my daughters.  I am very disappointed!  It took three washes for me to get a lather and then my hair was soooo tangled and matted afterwards.  I broke so much of my hair off trying to detangle it.  The conditioner did not help either.  I felt like it stripped all the natural moisture from my hair.  I wont use it again.  However, I did find it alright for my 13mos who still has her baby curly hair.</li>
            <li> I used this shampoo this morning and I was extremely disappointed.  It didn&#x27;t lather well at all.  Instead of detangling my hair and imparting moisture as is advertised, my hair was a tangled mess!  I also used the Tui Hair Smoothie afterwards (I was following Jada&#x27;s \\&quot;recipe\\&quot; that is on the Carol&#x27;s Daughter site)- I was disappointed with that as well.  I should have just put butter on my hair.  It didn&#x27;t penetrate well; it just sat on top of my hair.  My hair was a mess afterwards. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would not recommended this for someone with long thick hair like mine.  I don&#x27;t see how Jada got good results with this shampoo and conditioner as she has alot of hair as well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The fragrance of the shampoo and conditioner were nice.  So I ended up with nicely scented, tangled, dry hair.</li>
            <li> I received my Carol&#x27;s daughter \\&quot;Saturday Morning\\&quot; package in the mail today and couldn&#x27;t wait to use. I first noticed that as I was shampooing it wasn&#x27;t lathering. No big deal. Then when I went to go blow dry my hair using the black vanilla leave in coditioner, I noticed my HAIR WAS DRY, BRITTLE AND VERY TANGELED! ! ! ! I was horrified! WHAT HAVE I DONE!!!!! I normally used Dove Mosturizing shampoo and conditioner and blow dry my hair WITHOUT ANY MOSTURIZER AND IT COMES OUT SOFT AS COTTON!!!  But my hair is RELAXED and the developer of this product SHOULD NOTE ON HER WEBSITE THE CONSEQUENCES OF USING THIS PRODUCT ON RELAXED HAIR!!!! I had to put a great deal of her moisturized and flat iron strand by strand to get it manageable!!! DON&#x27;T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m growing out my relaxer, so I have half relaxed hair and half natural hair. I wear it quite long, so I really wanted to keep the length.  This shampoo works great on both types of my hair. My hair is not damaged, but always dry. Most shampoos (even ones that shouldn&#x27;t) seem to strip my hair of it&#x27;s moisture.  This one doesn&#x27;t; it left both my hair types moisturized and and incredibly soft.  I followed up with the black vanilla leave-in conditioner and then Lisa&#x27;s Hair Elixer.  I think it&#x27;s important to use the product line. The results for me are great and you can&#x27;t even tell the relaxed from natural.  No press and curl either; just a blow out!  I also use the products on my kids naturally curly hair (theirs is finer than mine) and FINALLY there is a product that keeps their hair shiny all day.  I use a spritz of the leave-in conditioner and a dollop of the elixer daily to tame both their heads (boy &amp; girl).</li>
            <li> I was very dissapointed when I tried this product.  I have tried many other Carol&#x27;s Daughter products, and have been very pleased with the results.  However, this shampoo is awful.  It doesn&#x27;t lather well.  It&#x27;s thick and gloppy, and hard to get out of the bottle.  The smell is tolerable, but barely.  Lastly, my hair felt rough and unclean.  So that I don&#x27;t feel totally ripped off, I wash my hair one or twice with this, and then wash again with something else.  Leave this one on the shelf.</li>
            <li> I was very excited when I received this shampoo because I have heard great things about it. My first time using it, I almost cried. My hair was so hard and tangled. I combed my hair out and it came out so much. The second time I learned my lesson. It took me two washes to get a good lather. Once I rinsed it out, I didnt comb my hair, but used a hot oil treatment to untangle my hair. This worked out so much better. My hair feels so clean and smells good afterwards but, I hate how it tangles my hair since on the bottle it says detangler. I dont think this is meant for thick hair.</li>
            <li> I bought the entire line of products from the Lisa&#x27;s Hair Regimen on the Carol&#x27;s daughter website. I took all the products back to Sephora yesterday. I used this Hair oil on my scalp and the next day my scalp started itching. I washed it that night and woke up the next morning in serious pain. I wear my hair natural and I had what felt like chemical burns all over my scalp. When I took the product back to Sephora the lady who sold it to me told me my scalp was RED w/ white spots all throughout it. I had to take OTC pain medication twice a day for three days just to help me sleep at night due to the pain. The only thing I can attribute it to is an allergic reaction. The product contain extracts from different types of plant and flowers. If you have allergies to these items I would suggest not using this product. I contacted Carol&#x27;s Daughter and have not heard back from them yet. I would have expected more from the company who&#x27;s product states &#x27;Made with Love, Peace&#x27;.  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I was so dissapointed with this product. I ordered from their website and spent $60 on products. This shampoo was the worst i ever used! It left my hair matted and it broke off when i tried to comb it. I had to rewash my hair with my usual stuff, the Optimum shampoo line, which is cheaper and works great w/my fine, shoulder length hair. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone, not even my sister who is sporting a natural right now.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does wonders with detangling may hair, which is thick and coarse! It also keeps my hair soft and managable after it is relaxed. I have several family members and friends who are faithful consumers of Carol&#x27;s Daughter products.         After reading these reviews, you people must keep in mind that, as with any other hair product(s), this product does not cater to all hair types, and NO specific line of hair products works with ALL hair types, lol...DUH.</li>
            <li> I had an awful experience with this product...........the scent is so over porwering I started not to use, but thought better since I paid a little money for this.....it made my hair feel much more coarse than it was and matted my hair. Thank goodness I had my Motions CPR to save my hair.</li>
            <li> I was given this product as a gift and have been very happy with it.  I am transitioning from relaxed to natural hair and have about 3 1/2 inches of relaxed ends left and I do find that with this shampoo those ends become tangled, while the rest of my hair is so easy to comb through.  (My natural hair is 3c/4a - soft, tightish spirals).  It has worked wonders on my scalp and and is very good at moisturizing my natural hair.  Initially, I was a bit weirded out by the lack of lather but quickly got over that once I saw and felt the result of washing with this product.  I use this in conjunction with CD Lisa&#x27;s Hair Elixir and I am one happy nappy girl!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few of the CD&#x27;s products - this one by far is the worst.  I used it because it said it was for dry hair, which I purchased for my daugther.  After the first wash, I was shocked and thought I had done something wrong as there was no lather....then I rewashed, 2 more times, eventually getting lather, but her hair started to cling together and become tight-spongelike; and it was really hard to comb out. In order to get her hair from being so spongy (tight and very stiff), I had to use her old shampoo, which worked.  The best thing about the product (which is why I gave it a \\&quot;2\\&quot;) was the smell and tingly feeling on the scalp (I also used the shampoo and didn&#x27;t like my results either - I had to pull out my old shampoo to wash out the CD product).  I ordered the product by mail so I never sent it back.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AWFUL!  It made my hair feel like straw.  I would not use it on your dog. ( that is if you love your dog)  BUYER BEWARE</li>
            <li> I stopped relaxing my hair a few years ago and have found that my natural hair texture consists mostly of VERY tight coils (which tangle easily). This product is great for detangling. It doesn&#x27;t lather, which took some getting used to, but my hair still felt and looked clean when I was done. Plus I love the thought of using natural ingredients...makes me feel safer.</li>
            <li> I love Carols Daughter products. Unfortunately I found a Carols Daughters product I do not love. This shampoo has the consistency of water. The Rosemary and Mint do not offer a gentle tingle or scalp stimulation at all. The smell is blah and my hair looked no cleaner then when i started.  I was very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> it works on my daughters dry coarse hair it helps it grow leaves it clean shiny ppl w/ the lathering prob first wash w/ another shampoo to get excess oil out then proceed  with carols daughter  this should help</li>
            <li> I got this item from Sephora and when I put it in my hair it made it a tangles mess. So I called Sephora and they resent me a new one that was totally a different color and worked much better. I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch or not but the second one worked good. I have very dry coarse hair. This doesn&#x27;t moisturize as much as I would like it too but works decent enough. I tried it with the Tui Hair Smoothie and the ahir smoothie left my hair a greasy mess. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the smoothie.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to Carol&#x27;s Daughter after watching The Tyra show w/ Jada Pinkett and Mary J. After watching the show i decided to use it because it is an all natural line of ethnic hair products (#1 must for me) i ordered the Rosemary Mint Herbal Shampoo, the Khoret Leave in Conditioner and also the Khoret smoothie. Come to find out, it is the worst products that I used. The shampoo claims to be for dry hair and detangling but it actually made my hair drier and extra tangled. The aroma of the Leave in conditoner is not enjoyable. While doing my hair my mom came in the bathroom and said \\&quot;that is diffrent hair products youre using because that new scent smells bad\\&quot; (i had to laugh) people also noticed the scent while i was at work and said i smell woodsey like a forest. I used the smoothie, slept in it and i felt no diffrence in my hair texture. My only defense for Carol&#x27;s Daughter is maybe because I have Bi-Racial hair and not 100% African-American hair, that could be the reason why it didnt work but unfortunetley that cannot be because I only use black hair care and other lines that works terrific. [...]</li>
            <li> Along with the others, you have to know your hair type, and this product is not for me. When I washed my hair with this product it immediately matted my hair up, I was so scared that my hair was going to come out. My hair felt so hard and tangled. It felt very rough. My hair has never felt like this before, I wished I never washed my hair with it. Luckily I got through this wash and I immediately but it far away from my eye sight. Carols Daughter do have some real good hair products, however this one was not for me. I thought I was the only one whom had a bad experience with this product, im glad im was not the only one.</li>
            <li> It took me 10 years to finally get the shine back into my hair..this shampoo ruined it !  It has made my hair dull, lifeless. It is still stuck in my hair like an awful wax, or a really harsh hair product. I&#x27;m wondering if it will ever wash out. UGH !</li>
            <li> It cleans hair without stripping it of essential oils. The mint makes my scalp tingle, which I love. It detangles my natural kinky dry hair, and leaves it moisturized. Just like all products, THEY WILL NOT WORK FOR EVERYONE...and I cannot stress that enough. You just have to be patient and find the right thing that works for your hair (especially if you are natural, believe me, I have been down that road and have tried TONS of products) and this one works for me. It probably not designed for people with relaxed hair (judging from the other reviews). But I can speak for my natural hair, and it LOVES this shampoo!!!</li>
            <li> I got my hope up about this product and did not get results. I have been trying to go natural but my hair is really thick with tight coils. For this product to have mint in it you did not get the KERA CARE breeze feeling. I tried it for about a month with no results. My hair is still easily tangled with or without this product.</li>
