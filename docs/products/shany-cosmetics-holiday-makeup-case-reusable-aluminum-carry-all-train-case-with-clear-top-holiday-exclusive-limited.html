            <li>so it was perfect.</li>
            <li>I will be happy to give this as one of my granddaughters Christmas gifts.  </li>
            <li>the case is great for use after the make up is used.</li>
            <li>sticks were wonderful though and are nice and creamy.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>the make up you get is very nice and is great for girls or women.</li>
            <li>My granddaughter absolutely loved this gift.</li>
            <li>it looks great and the makeup quality looks nice.</li>
            <li>Im sure you don&#x27;t take this to runway!</li>
            <li>It is a nice product for gift.</li>
            <li>and she thought the makeup was really nice.  </li>
            <li>the lipsticks have a nice amount of shine.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line</li>
            <li>The cosmetics seemed to be of good quality and she was so excited to get it.</li>
            <li>I know she will love it.</li>
            <li>Slapping a piece of tape over the powder products may ship them better, because what you have going on... doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to carry this around, but where would you take this?</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly !  </li>
            <li>I thought this would be a great Christmas present for my sisters</li>
            <li>i do think that the light when the photo was taken probably affected the colors of the lip glosses.</li>
            <li>When i got the box i was excited because it was a gift for my granddaughter until i opened the box,the mirror was fine,but the makeup was a desaster,there was make up everywhere</li>
            <li>My girls absolutely loved it, much bigger case than I thought too.  </li>
            <li>It would have been good if the makeup didn&#x27;t break open and get everywhere.</li>
            <li>They really need to package the item better to keep the product from being damaged during shipment.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s a really great kit, the eyeshadows are pigmented</li>
            <li>just the right amount, and</li>
            <li>I was able to put the lipstick back together</li>
            <li>I recommend they advise the manufacturer of this product to make sure they get that plastic inner lining sealed before packing this in the train case.</li>
            <li>and it was intended for play time, not for real life!  </li>
            <li>the lipstick wasnt even in the tube case.and almost everything was out of place.need to find a better way to ship.i will be sending it back today july 19th.maybe</li>
            <li>The delivery was fast and well packed.</li>
            <li>This was more than I expected........</li>
            <li>This product, though it looks great online, comes poorly packaged and pieces were flying around inside the case everywhere.  </li>
            <li>by the time the product got to me the blush and more than one eye shadows were in pieces and everywhere this caused me to not be willing to buy make up through amazon some of the makeup things that are part of the bundle were not closed correctly, since i bought it for a holiday present</li>
            <li>I am really upset with the product.</li>
            <li>so the delivery was fast</li>
            <li>I got this kit for Christmas, and i really like it.</li>
            <li>This was the one gift that my youngest grandaughter wanted so at the request of her mother I ordered it for her, She absolutely lovs it.</li>
            <li>The case is steady and well constructed.</li>
            <li>Since I bought them for $34.99, and now they are at $30, I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $30 for this set, because the red case is for $40 and is much bigger.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 9 years old daughter she really like it.</li>
            <li>No where near repairable or giving away as a gift.</li>
            <li>This item arrived looking completely obliterated.</li>
            <li>This completely ruined it as a gift.</li>
            <li>If possible I want a new one as replacement.</li>
            <li>more carefully done better because all the powers were broken, and what a mess.</li>
            <li>I had the EXACT experience that the other two reviewers had.  </li>
            <li>Some of the cells were more powder then solid and the powder spread to other parts of the kit making a mess of everything else.</li>
            <li>I would definitely not order this product again, and especially not for an adult or even a teenager.</li>
            <li>Like the product, not as much as the 3 layer or other big sets.</li>
            <li>gloss colors are not as red (Hard to get out of tube as well) and nail polishes were not pigmented enough, needed 3 coats for full color.&lt;br /&gt;Lip</li>
            <li>Aside from the super mess and damage, this is still useable and I am happy with the cosmetics overall, but I am giving this 1 star for very bad care from the maker.</li>

            <li> Bought 3 for my little cousins and bought the big red one for my older cousin.</li>
            <li> Like several of the other reviewers, this make up kit arrived with all of the products out of place in the carrying case and fine powder from a broken blush cartridge all over every inch of the case and its contents.</li>
            <li> The glue used to adhere the individual colors to the compacts did not hold and due to the movement during shipping they cracked and got the makeup all over everything.  </li>
            <li> Well, there was pink blush on every inch of this case.</li>
            <li> im really not concerned about the content.</li>
            <li> Much of it was broken, opened or just not usable.</li>
            <li> it was supposed to be a gift for someone, and she was excited to open it just to be disappointed for what she saw.</li>
            <li> Powder &amp; blush were in pieces &amp; all over the other items in the case.  </li>
            <li> Exterior is one sided window, and black metal on the other side.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to mess it up.</li>
            <li> When the package arrived I opened and checked it only to find all the powders had &amp;#34;shattered&amp;#34; and broken and the package was a powdery mess.  </li>
            <li> it was a disaster as a gift and a waste of money</li>
            <li> that not only were things out of place, but the blushes, eye shadows, etc were not just out of place but broken as well.  </li>
            <li> This kit arrived with several of the colors detached from the packaging and broken.  </li>
            <li> I then went and found replacements for all the powders that were broken so there would no be empty spots in the kit.</li>
            <li> All In One Harmony Makeup Kit, 25 Ounce]]Due to poor product packaging this came in disrepair, the powder was sprinkled throughout this case because I make this claim and can send back the product as this is useless.</li>
            <li> I was not pleased when I opened the case to find the makeup was everywhere!</li>
            <li> The factory that made this item failed to tape the molded plastic insert lid down so nothing could go flying or get jostled in its plastic liner inside the train case.</li>
            <li> product came all broken up and a mess!  !</li>
            <li> I should never have ordered this product after all of the poor reviews it received.</li>
            <li> It arrived damaged with broken makeup and powder all over the inside of the case.</li>
            <li> After cleaning up the blush, all that was damaged was the 1 blush, 1 broken lipstick, loosened makeup shades from their cases and 1 broken eye shadow.</li>
            <li> Except that one of the lipsticks came broken.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this all happened because my daughter received an Amazon gift card and selected her gifts without us screening reviews.</li>
            <li> i was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I was expecting, extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Also the Eyeshadows and blushes come off of their container which is really annoying.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed ordered this item as a christmas gift.  </li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter and she is very disappointed!</li>
            <li> The packaging was HORRIBLE.</li>
            <li> Worst product I&#x27;ve EVER ordered!!!</li>

            <li> I should never have ordered this product after all of the poor reviews it received. It arrived damaged with broken makeup and powder all over the inside of the case. This was a gift for my daughter and she is very disappointed! You would think that this problem would have been remedied by now. Do not buy this product unless you want the hassle of returning it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 9 years old daughter she really like it. It is a nice product for gift.</li>
            <li> The packaging was HORRIBLE. I received it 2 days before Christmas and everything spilled out of it&#x27;s cases and was everywhere. No where near repairable or giving away as a gift. Worst product I&#x27;ve EVER ordered!!!</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my daughter-in-law and she thought the makeup was really nice.  She was going on a trip so it was perfect.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone.  It came to me in pieces.  I had to send it back.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter absolutely loved this gift. The cosmetics seemed to be of good quality and she was so excited to get it. The delivery was fast and well packed.</li>
            <li> My girls absolutely loved it, much bigger case than I thought too.  I will definitely recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> This item arrived looking completely obliterated. The factory that made this item failed to tape the molded plastic insert lid down so nothing could go flying or get jostled in its plastic liner inside the train case. Well, there was pink blush on every inch of this case. I can&#x27;t blame Amazon. They did pack this item well. I didn&#x27;t have any time to return this, so I decided to salvage what I could. After cleaning up the blush, all that was damaged was the 1 blush, 1 broken lipstick, loosened makeup shades from their cases and 1 broken eye shadow. I was able to put the lipstick back together so now I am out 1 blush and 1 eye shadow. After I cleaned it up and got everything resealed in the case it looks great and the makeup quality looks nice. I recommend they advise the manufacturer of this product to make sure they get that plastic inner lining sealed before packing this in the train case. Aside from the super mess and damage, this is still useable and I am happy with the cosmetics overall, but I am giving this 1 star for very bad care from the maker. Don&#x27;t blame Amazon. They packed it well, but that didn&#x27;t help any with this product.</li>
            <li> product came all broken up and a mess!  !it was a disaster as a gift and a waste of money</li>
            <li> This was more than I expected........actually quite big.  Arrived quickly !  I will be happy to give this as one of my granddaughters Christmas gifts.  I know she will love it.</li>
            <li> i should have read the reviews before i placed my order! i was disappointed. It was damaged. it was supposed to be a gift for someone, and she was excited to open it just to be disappointed for what she saw.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package, the eye shadow was everywhere! This completely ruined it as a gift. It would have been good if the makeup didn&#x27;t break open and get everywhere.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my niece and thank goodness she is only 11 and it was intended for play time, not for real life!  This product, though it looks great online, comes poorly packaged and pieces were flying around inside the case everywhere.  Once I opened the case to rearrange the items I found that not only were things out of place, but the blushes, eye shadows, etc were not just out of place but broken as well.  I would definitely not order this product again, and especially not for an adult or even a teenager. This product is strictly play time only quality.</li>
            <li> bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she just loves it. the case is great for use after the make up is used. The case can be used again. the make up you get is very nice and is great for girls or women.</li>
            <li> The receiver reported that when it arrived, some of the powders were shattered. So now she&#x27;s in the process of trying to return it. We&#x27;ll see what happens.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a great Christmas present for my sisters but when I got these they were all busted! I&#x27;m so upset!!!</li>
            <li> by the time the product got to me the blush and more than one eye shadows were in pieces and everywhere this caused me to not be willing to buy make up through amazon some of the makeup things that are part of the bundle were not closed correctly, since i bought it for a holiday present Im having to buy something else somewhere else.</li>
            <li> I found one of the face powder box severely damaged and the powder was scattered in all the box. It is a gift for my sister. I am really upset with the product. If possible I want a new one as replacement.</li>
            <li> Four days before Christmas I receive product, which I had ordered five days before...so the delivery was fast but I would rather have had shipping to be slower and more carefully done better because all the powers were broken, and what a mess. I tore everything apart and cleaned everything in the kit. I then went and found replacements for all the powders that were broken so there would no be empty spots in the kit. The lipstick covers were even off the tubs as were the eye pencils. Slapping a piece of tape over the powder products may ship them better, because what you have going on... doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I got this kit for Christmas, and i really like it. Except that one of the lipsticks came broken. Also the Eyeshadows and blushes come off of their container which is really annoying. Other than that it&#x27;s a really great kit, the eyeshadows are pigmented just the right amount, and the lipsticks have a nice amount of shine.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line i would recommend this to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*******UPDATE**************&lt;br /&gt;Lip gloss colors are not as red (Hard to get out of tube as well) and nail polishes were not pigmented enough, needed 3 coats for full color.&lt;br /&gt;Lip sticks were wonderful though and are nice and creamy.&lt;br /&gt;But i do think that the light when the photo was taken probably affected the colors of the lip glosses.</li>
            <li> When i got the box i was excited because it was a gift for my granddaughter until i opened the box,the mirror was fine,but the makeup was a desaster,there was make up everywhere the lipstick wasnt even in the tube case.and almost everything was out of place.need to find a better way to ship.i will be sending it back today july 19th.maybe the next one will be better.thanks kathy</li>
            <li> This kit arrived with several of the colors detached from the packaging and broken.  The glue used to adhere the individual colors to the compacts did not hold and due to the movement during shipping they cracked and got the makeup all over everything.  Would not recommend!</li>
            <li> Like the product, not as much as the 3 layer or other big sets. I like this just because of the case, the case would go for $25 by itself, so im really not concerned about the content. Bought 3 for my little cousins and bought the big red one for my older cousin. The case is steady and well constructed. I didn&#x27;t open the makeup to try, since they all came in wrapped and I didn&#x27;t want to mess it up. Exterior is one sided window, and black metal on the other side. It&#x27;s easy to carry this around, but where would you take this? Im sure you don&#x27;t take this to runway! But I would give this as  a gift, it has a luxury look, and it will serve the propose. Would I buy this again? If the price drops again under $30, I will buy it! Since I bought them for $34.99, and now they are at $30, I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $30 for this set, because the red case is for $40 and is much bigger. Would I recommend this to friends? Yea, if you are going to do Christmas stuffing like me, this is a must have, otherwise, no.</li>
            <li> I was not pleased when I opened the case to find the makeup was everywhere! Much of it was broken, opened or just not usable. They really need to package the item better to keep the product from being damaged during shipment.</li>
            <li> Like several of the other reviewers, this make up kit arrived with all of the products out of place in the carrying case and fine powder from a broken blush cartridge all over every inch of the case and its contents. As another reviewer mentioned, this item cannot be replaced if damaged because it was sold by another seller. Unfortunately, this all happened because my daughter received an Amazon gift card and selected her gifts without us screening reviews. Please do not repeat our mistake. Heed the reviews. Do not buy this item.</li>
            <li> I had the EXACT experience that the other two reviewers had.  Powder &amp; blush were in pieces &amp; all over the other items in the case.  All items were dislodged from there slots. Amazon won&#x27;t replace it.  Only choice is to return.  Will buy something else instead.</li>
            <li> This was the one gift that my youngest grandaughter wanted so at the request of her mother I ordered it for her, She absolutely lovs it.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B005UKZAJG SHANY 2012 Edition All In One Harmony Makeup Kit, 25 Ounce]]Due to poor product packaging this came in disrepair, the powder was sprinkled throughout this case because I make this claim and can send back the product as this is useless. I await your prompt response.</li>
            <li> Some of the cells were more powder then solid and the powder spread to other parts of the kit making a mess of everything else.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed ordered this item as a christmas gift.  When the package arrived I opened and checked it only to find all the powders had &amp;#34;shattered&amp;#34; and broken and the package was a powdery mess.  Not at all what I was expecting, extremely disappointed.</li>
