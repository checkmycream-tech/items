            <li>I bought my first bottle at the doctor&#x27;s office and it was $40 there, so Amazon&#x27;s price is much better.  </li>

            <li>This product helps my skin maintains a healthy balance between real cleaning and not drying.</li>
            <li>the gel is mild but thoroughly cleanes the skin</li>
            <li>and this is the first cleanser to work so well for me!</li>
            <li>my husband has even commented on how good my skin looks recently, which is a real testament to this product and the rest of the line.</li>
            <li>i have sensitive skin and so many products</li>
            <li>I have fair, sensitive skin that can easily get dry.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin this product is great, very gentle, doesn&#x27;t dry out your face!</li>
            <li>Very gentle cleansing</li>
            <li>It is also very gentle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many others and keep going back to this.</li>
            <li>Love this facial cleanser - it was recommended by a dermatologist years ago</li>
            <li>I first tried this when I worked in a Dermatology office and we sold it there.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and using this cleansing gel plus the lotion works wonders!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>This product is soft and makes my face feel soooo clean.</li>
            <li>Skin feel soft, clean after use.  </li>
            <li>I have super sensitive combination skin</li>
            <li>It really does what it claims:</li>
            <li>This one not so much.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is so gentle</li>
            <li>Rather it was in a tube, which is a real pain to use.</li>
            <li>The other drug store to many department store brands do not even compare.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to find a cleanser that left my skin clean feeling without drying it out or causing irritation.</li>
            <li>Would have given it 5 starts but doesn&#x27;t clean very deep.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Yes it is pricey but to me, worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>; it does more for me than a harsh acne fighting facial cleanser, and that&#x27;s really all I want.</li>
            <li>The make up washes off so easily, and all you need is a little bit of the stuff.  </li>
            <li>This is a lightly fragranced product that has a deep cleansing capability without being overloaded with a long list of chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I have normal to dry skin and large pores.  </li>
            <li>She actually recommended a different Exuviance cleanser that was supposed to be more gentle and non-drying, but I found it dried my oily skin out more and was not doing a good job of cleaning it :(!   </li>
            <li>It only takes a very small amount and lathers so nicely.</li>
            <li>The mascara and other makeup comes right off the wash cloth too.</li>
            <li>I normally use Purpose brand facial cleanser, and that can take off my makeup without murdering my eyes.</li>
            <li>it cleanse deeply,but not dry out my skin.my skin feel soft ,</li>
            <li>My skin feels so clean after using just a small amount and it even removes waterproof mascara with no problem or scrubbing.</li>
            <li>I had a professional facial recently with Exuviance products.</li>
            <li>Does not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>Just a tiny bit washes my whole face so a single bottle will last me about three months.  </li>
            <li>I have super oily skin with occasional breakouts now that I am in my 30s+ and have been using this product for the past 3 months.  </li>
            <li>I have not seen any real results with this product, and its more expensive then other products that I have seen results with.</li>

            <li> I have not seen any real results with this product, and its more expensive then other products that I have seen results with.</li>
            <li> It cleanses really well without making your skin feel tight and dry.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, even though it is pretty gently it still became drying for my skin over time (which then causes my skin to get irritated).</li>
            <li> The price has certainly increased from $18 to now $28 in the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> This calms my skin, doesn&#x27;t dry, and makes my pores appear smaller.  </li>
            <li> and I see a visible improvement in my skin vs. other (more expensive) products.  </li>
            <li> It goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> This face wash doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out or cause any irritation.</li>
            <li> One reason I use it about every other day is because it can be harsh when used with other products (I use a prescription strength tretinion, 10% Glycolic AHA, colloidal sulfur cream (morning), and occasionally a BP cream (morning)).</li>
            <li> Very little required when you use so does last a while</li>
            <li> It keeps the moisture in my skin as will and a little goes a long way!!</li>
            <li> I have tried every possible cleanser out there on the market from ProActive, Clinique, Clarins, Lancome, BE Rareminerals, Noxzema, Oil of Olay,... to Mario Badescu of late.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t try up the skin and small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended that I use this a few years ago</li>
            <li> Occassionally I try a different line because I get bored</li>
            <li> I am on an insane skin regimen where I use about 6 different products at different times, so I do not use this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 15 years at least and have tried others at times,  but none come close to the quality and skin care results as Exuviance Purifying Cleansing Gel!</li>
            <li> made my skin worse!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Does a good job of taking off makeup without over drying. My husband even likes to use it. One bottle lasts several months between the two of us.</li>
            <li> Great cleanse.  Love the smell</li>
            <li> I had a professional facial recently with Exuviance products. The renewal of my skin was quite visible immediately. The technician took years off my appearance in one treatment. I purchased the products afterwards and have been enjoying them at home. The cleansing gel is effective, yet gentle. I use it with the Moisture Balance Toner and Age Reverse Day Repair moisturizer. It was money well-spent.</li>
            <li> 1st introduced to this line by an Ulta rep.  I have super oily skin with occasional breakouts now that I am in my 30s+ and have been using this product for the past 3 months.  She actually recommended a different Exuviance cleanser that was supposed to be more gentle and non-drying, but I found it dried my oily skin out more and was not doing a good job of cleaning it :(!   Anyways, I decided to switch to the \\&quot;purifying gel\\&quot; cleanser and this is by far the best cleanser ever (for me).  I have tried every possible cleanser out there on the market from ProActive, Clinique, Clarins, Lancome, BE Rareminerals, Noxzema, Oil of Olay,... to Mario Badescu of late.  I liked the Mario Beadescu enzyme cleanser but love the Exuviance purifying gel cleanser so much more.  It really does what it claims: a non-drying, soap-free (aka Non Drying) deep cleanser.  I look forward to cleaning my face every day.  The make up washes off so easily, and all you need is a little bit of the stuff.  It goes a long way.  I also love the light, clean scent of all of the products in this line.  Best cleanser I have come across for my oily skin in a LONG while.  BTW my husband has even commented on how good my skin looks recently, which is a real testament to this product and the rest of the line.</li>
            <li> Good cleanser, although it sometimes seemed like a lot of product was needed to thoroughly remove makeup. I have fair, sensitive skin that can easily get dry. I was hoping to find a cleanser that left my skin clean feeling without drying it out or causing irritation. Unfortunately, even though it is pretty gently it still became drying for my skin over time (which then causes my skin to get irritated). I didn&#x27;t have any major complaints with this product, but it did not do anything great for my skin, either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Exuviance for years. This was great advice given to me by one of the best dermatologists I have found. I have sought out many in MN and NY area. This product is soft and makes my face feel soooo clean. Even my friends who have tried it, said what have I been using for years. The other drug store to many department store brands do not even compare. I&#x27;ve tried so many others and keep going back to this. The price has certainly increased from $18 to now $28 in the past 10 years. However, it&#x27;s a great product. You will love it!!!</li>
            <li> Would have given it 5 starts but doesn&#x27;t clean very deep.  Very gentle cleansing</li>
            <li> Love it.  Skin feel soft, clean after use.  Doesn&#x27;t try up the skin and small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in hopes it would help with my acne and fade some scars. I am on an insane skin regimen where I use about 6 different products at different times, so I do not use this product every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, when I do use this product I love it! It leaves my skin extremely soft and clean (with a gentle &amp; delicious smell). I have noticed some lightening of my scars and overall skin improvement, but I do not think that can be solely attributed to this product. One reason I use it about every other day is because it can be harsh when used with other products (I use a prescription strength tretinion, 10% Glycolic AHA, colloidal sulfur cream (morning), and occasionally a BP cream (morning)). I normally use Purpose brand facial cleanser, and that can take off my makeup without murdering my eyes. This one not so much. I did it once and learned my lesson; it burned (but that could be just my reaction).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do love that it is soap-free; it does more for me than a harsh acne fighting facial cleanser, and that&#x27;s really all I want.</li>
            <li> I love this product. My skin feels so clean after using just a small amount and it even removes waterproof mascara with no problem or scrubbing. The mascara and other makeup comes right off the wash cloth too. It is also very gentle. Amazing!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this facial cleanser - it was recommended by a dermatologist years ago and I lost track of how to purchase it. Does not dry out your skin. Very refreshing - I love it and will continue to purchase it.!</li>
            <li> This is a lightly fragranced product that has a deep cleansing capability without being overloaded with a long list of chemicals.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I am forty-four, and the glycolic acid in this product makes a visible lift and firmness in my skin. Also works great for my 15 year olds acne. Glycolic acid is the magic ingredient I think.</li>
            <li> I first tried this when I worked in a Dermatology office and we sold it there.  I love this stuff!  It is my all time favorite cleanser.  It only takes a very small amount and lathers so nicely. The smell is wonderful too!  They sell it at ULTA for $40, so this is a great buy!!</li>
            <li> This cleanser is so gentle and yet it can cut through the oil on my face.  I have very sensitive skin and this is probably the best product I have found.</li>
            <li> Love this brand. This face wash doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out or cause any irritation. I have acne prone skin and don&#x27;t have any problems with this. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This product lasts forever and I see a visible improvement in my skin vs. other (more expensive) products.  Occassionally I try a different line because I get bored but I always come back.  I have normal to dry skin and large pores.  This calms my skin, doesn&#x27;t dry, and makes my pores appear smaller.  I recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! I have been using Exuviance for about 7years or so.  It cleanses really well without making your skin feel tight and dry.  It keeps the moisture in my skin as will and a little goes a long way!!</li>
            <li> Good and will last you a while</li>
            <li> This product helps my skin maintains a healthy balance between real cleaning and not drying.</li>
            <li> Love this face wash!  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and I love the way it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years... Do not wish to switch... If it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it!  Love it!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended that I use this a few years ago and I have been using it ever since.  I bought my first bottle at the doctor&#x27;s office and it was $40 there, so Amazon&#x27;s price is much better.  I love the product, keeps my face smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I have tried every line of skin care products under the sun and now that i have found Exuviance, i will never purchase anything else.  The line is absolutely phenomenal.  i have sensitive skin and so many products made my skin worse!  the gel is mild but thoroughly cleanes the skin and i top it off with their moisturizing sunscreen.  Yes it is pricey but to me, worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every cleanser out there. Exuviance is hands down the best! I have very oily skin and using this cleansing gel plus the lotion works wonders! I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Exuviance for years.  I love the cleaning feeling I have after washing my face, without any drying out of my skin.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have used Exuviance products for years. This cleanser foams and feels good while cleansing your face.</li>
            <li> It is okay, but I do not think I will order again. I have not seen any real results with this product, and its more expensive then other products that I have seen results with.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser!  I use a facial sponge with it to exfoliate and it&#x27;s perfection.  Just a tiny bit washes my whole face so a single bottle will last me about three months.  I have super sensitive combination skin and this is the first cleanser to work so well for me!</li>
            <li> I love this product--have used it for quit some time now and makes skin feel smooth and soft-will purchase again</li>
            <li> Used this line for years . Great Product.</li>
            <li> No complaints about the product, however when it arrived, it was not in the dispenser as depicted in the picture.  Rather it was in a tube, which is a real pain to use.</li>
            <li> The best face cleansing product I have had.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin this product is great, very gentle, doesn&#x27;t dry out your face! Very little required when you use so does last a while</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 15 years at least and have tried others at times,  but none come close to the quality and skin care results as Exuviance Purifying Cleansing Gel!</li>
            <li> it cleanse deeply,but not dry out my skin.my skin feel soft ,before that my skin have some  pimples now it stop break out.</li>
            <li> I received the product in a tube not in the bottle as shown. Had I not been leaving to go out of town I would have returned it.</li>
