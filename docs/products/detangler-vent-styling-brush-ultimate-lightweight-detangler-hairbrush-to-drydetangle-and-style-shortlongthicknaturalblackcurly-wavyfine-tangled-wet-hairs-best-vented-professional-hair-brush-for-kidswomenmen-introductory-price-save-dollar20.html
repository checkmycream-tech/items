            <li>Works great for both types of hair.</li>
            <li>Great price for the product.  </li>
            <li>This brush is amazing !</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m VERY, VERY satisfied.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I find I can now use it more effectively and the bristles feel great</li>
            <li>and I love it!  </li>
            <li>works great right after a keratin treatment.</li>
            <li>At this price I would expect better quality in an 8 month time span.</li>
            <li>maybe b/c there are so many of them?   </li>
            <li>and I am well pleased with this.</li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed!  </li>
            <li>easily does the job without yanking.  </li>
            <li>I put it on full blast</li>
            <li>The head is a bit larger then my old brush, but it is gentle to my hair, not unwieldy to manage, &amp; detangles beautifully.  </li>
            <li>So much for speeding up my hair drying time!  </li>
            <li>Does a nice job of of combing wet hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first brush for hair drying that I&#x27;ve found that works for me.  </li>
            <li>Love this brush - it provides a large area for my hair to be stretched over while I blow-dry it.  </li>
            <li>but none of them have gotten my hair this straight.</li>
            <li>and I can get my hair pin straight with this.</li>
            <li>I bought this detangler brush to replace a similar style that I had for 2 years that broke, &amp; is no longer available.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it</li>
            <li>A little large to hold for a child but fine for adults.</li>
            <li>The tips are tiny but it is not uncomfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>I actually have recommended to some friends after they complimented how straight my hair looked.</li>
            <li>and then it continues to stop working every time I shut it off so it now has increased my blow drying time by at least 10-15 more minutes.  </li>
            <li>Best part is, none of the pins have broken off  yet (which regular brushes in the past always did after a month of use).</li>

            <li> I have long hair and this one does not tangle in my hair or pull...</li>
            <li> With the vented slots you can also use to blow dry your hair.</li>
            <li> I was hoping the new brush would work at least as well</li>
            <li> I cut off one row of bristles as it&#x27;s too wide for my head.  </li>
            <li> I would prefer if it were about 2/3rds as wide as it is, as it&#x27;s not useful in combing out the part on the side of my head.     </li>
            <li> I received the brush the other day</li>
            <li> The service was less than a week</li>
            <li> This brush is used by my daughter who has long hair and my grandson who has extremely thick tight curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I did like this dryer initially because it helped speed up the drying time of my very thick hair.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion this one works just as well at half the cost!</li>
            <li> and now I am getting very annoyed as it completely stops working after 5-10 minutes</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long hair and this brush</li>
            <li> and I have to wait at least 5 minutes before it will start again</li>
            <li> It brushes through my thick , curly hair with ease and the curved effect conforms to your scalp and gives your head a massage .</li>
            <li> However, as others have mentioned, the attachment nozzle frequently pops off which is very annoying and the dryer is a bit heavy.  </li>
            <li> I have VERY thick, wavy hair</li>
            <li> I have hip length very thick hair</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t broken yet!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Perfect brush. Had bought on years ago at a kiosk in the Florida Mall. Have tried finding it again for the last 2 years. Finally, on Amazon! It gives through tangles with ease. Has a good grip and the width is perfect. With the vented slots you can also use to blow dry your hair. Great brush!</li>
            <li> I order from Amazon several times a month and have never written a review... I needed to for this straightener though. It is amazing!!!! I&#x27;ve been straightening my hair for over ten years and have used tons of straighteners but none of them have gotten my hair this straight. I have VERY thick, wavy hair and I can get my hair pin straight with this. I put it on full blast but you don&#x27;t even need to. I would recommend this to anyone. I actually have recommended to some friends after they complimented how straight my hair looked.</li>
            <li> COULD, BUT WOULDN&#x27;T WANT TO</li>
            <li> This brush is the bomb!  I have hip length very thick hair and I&#x27;ve NEVER found a brush that detangles my hair this well.  I&#x27;d been using a paddle brush for years, but recently saw a video where the person was using a brush like this.  Her hair was a similar length and thickness to mine, so I immediately went on a search for the brush.  I&#x27;ve been using it for two months now and I&#x27;m VERY, VERY satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for several months now and I love it!  I have very thick, long hair and this brush easily does the job without yanking.  Best part is, none of the pins have broken off  yet (which regular brushes in the past always did after a month of use).</li>

            <li> I did like this dryer initially because it helped speed up the drying time of my very thick hair.  However, as others have mentioned, the attachment nozzle frequently pops off which is very annoying and the dryer is a bit heavy.  I have had it for 8 months and now I am getting very annoyed as it completely stops working after 5-10 minutes and I have to wait at least 5 minutes before it will start again and then it continues to stop working every time I shut it off so it now has increased my blow drying time by at least 10-15 more minutes.  So much for speeding up my hair drying time!  At this price I would expect better quality in an 8 month time span.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s the first brush for hair drying that I&#x27;ve found that works for me.  I thought the curved design would not work but it does.  I cut off one row of bristles as it&#x27;s too wide for my head.  The tips are tiny but it is not uncomfortable to use.  I would prefer if it were about 2/3rds as wide as it is, as it&#x27;s not useful in combing out the part on the side of my head.     UPDATE:  I find I can now use it more effectively and the bristles feel great maybe b/c there are so many of them?   I&#x27;m changing it to five stars.</li>
            <li> Love this brush - it provides a large area for my hair to be stretched over while I blow-dry it.  Great price for the product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for months and had no problems with it.</li>
            <li> I used to have the pricier brand name version of this brush. In my opinion this one works just as well at half the cost!</li>
            <li> works great right after a keratin treatment.</li>
            <li> Best hairbrush EVER! I have long hair and this one does not tangle in my hair or pull...</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t broken yet!</li>
            <li> I received the brush the other day and I really like it, it fluffs my hair up and doesn&#x27;t pull your hair. The service was less than a week and I am well pleased with this.</li>
