            <li>I do not waste money</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it was just old or that it is a different formulation.  </li>
            <li>It does not smell like I remembered this fragrance to smell; It seemed and smelled like it was outdated, cheap and very old.</li>

            <li> If I was purchasing this for myself, it wouldn&#x27;t have been as big of a concern, but it was embarassing giving it to someone as a gift with some of it missing.</li>

            <li> Someone went past me in a store and asked me what I was wearing.</li>
            <li> A little disappointed in the price (fairly expensive to what I&#x27;ve paid on other sites in the past, but not available from my usual sources).</li>
            <li> This is the perfume I started wearing when I was 14, and I never get tired of it.</li>
            <li> Poor Quality, not happy at all.</li>
            <li> I now have 2 bottles of something that literally makes me sick!</li>
            <li> So, needless to say, I was ecstatic that this cologne could be found thru Amazon!!!</li>

            <li> I ordered Lutece by Dana, but what I got is by another name  and the fragrance is not the same.  Amazon was very kind to make a correction on the order. So I   still don&#x27;t have the fragrance I ordered.  What happened to Dana?    If Lutece by Dana is available I would like to reorder.    Edna Tamarin</li>
            <li> I was using Lutece perfum for the last 10 years. I can not find this good smell of this perfum in San Juan PR. So I took a great decition to buy the productt Through internet with Amazon.com. It is my favorite AROMA . I am very happy with this purcharse.</li>
            <li> I remember this smelling much better about 20 years ago!!! My mother used to wear it and I would sneak and use it as well.  Once upon a time I love it but the smell is waaaaaaay different now!!!!  I now have 2 bottles of something that literally makes me sick!</li>
            <li> I bought this item based on reviews. Definitely not to my liking. Not sure how to describe same. Going to give it to relative. Hoping her taste is different from mine.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this in the stores forever.  I have been wearing this perfurme for 20 years and always get compliments.</li>
            <li> This is the perfume I started wearing when I was 14, and I never get tired of it. I was very glad to find it; stupid Perfumania.com doesn&#x27;t have it.</li>
            <li> Since using this product, the elegant subtle fragrance that is \\&quot;Lutece\\&quot; has gotten me many compliments.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this for the past 28 years and I have been having difficulty locating stores that sell it.  My son told me Amazon had it and I was thrilled!!!  I will be buying it from them in the future!!</li>
            <li> This is a very hard-to-find perfume, so I was happy to find it on Amazon.  A little disappointed in the price (fairly expensive to what I&#x27;ve paid on other sites in the past, but not available from my usual sources).</li>
            <li> Had at last found a cologne that works well with my chemistry &amp; have used it for years, receiving ongoing compliments on it. Use to be able to purchase Lutece locally &amp; then per a catalog, which now does not carry it.  So, needless to say, I was ecstatic that this cologne could be found thru Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> Lutece is a long time favorite of mine.  Was so excited to find it on Amazon, cause couldn&#x27;t get it elsewhere.  Thanks for offering it. Please keep stocking it.  FlorenceF.</li>
            <li> I wore this perfume when I was in high school, but couldn&#x27;t find it until now.  I was concerned that it might not smell the way it used to.  However, I still smells great, and is long lasting. I have received more compliments on this perfume than when I wear the more expensive ones.  I will purchase again.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s signature perfume...I have been buying this for the past 20 years...it&#x27;s difficult to find in shopping malls and online purchase is the only sure thing...Perfume is still great and packaged well...price is getting up there but then again so is everything.</li>
            <li> My understanding is that this fragrance is no longer manufactured. This is not what I thought to be the last bottle in town lucky find. What&#x27;s inside the bottle is bogus. It doesn&#x27;t even smell like the original fragrance gone stale. Stay away and save your money. The company I bought from said to return it (at my expense, of course). I am not spending another dime on that rip off. I do not waste money but I tossed it into the trash and took the loss. That mystery stuff could be toxic.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to be the exact same as the original. This has been my favorite scent my wife has ever used. We purchased this knowing we would probably never get a chance to purchase again. I hope they again begin to manufacture. I don&#x27;t know if it was just old or that it is a different formulation.  It just doesn&#x27;t seem to be as good.</li>
            <li> I likes it the best!!&lt;br /&gt;My  only complaint is  price is higher then it used to be.</li>
            <li> This is soft and sweet!  Just wonderful and I would recommend this to anyone who love&#x27;s feminine to the max.  My mother-in-law just loved it too.  I intstantly fell MADLY in love when I recieved this not knowing what it was going to smell like.  I was not disapointed at all.  This is a sexy baby powder smell, its right for almost anyone.  This is my new signature scent for awhile.  I hope everyone loves this as much as I do.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product at all. It does not smell like I remembered this fragrance to smell; It seemed and smelled like it was outdated, cheap and very old. Poor Quality, not happy at all.</li>
            <li> Fresh and clean smell! Someone went past me in a store and asked me what I was wearing. I told her Lutece and she said it smells soooooo good! What other compliment do you need?</li>
            <li> This was just exactly what it said it would be.  The fragrance is what I have worn for years.  I&#x27;d purchase this item again!</li>
            <li> Bait and switch. Not clear in what was expected and difficult to work with. Would not purchase from them again, very overpriced</li>
            <li> Love it am stocking up since its no loner made. Wish I could find the fragranced lotion too. Need more and to get the lotion if anyone knows where or how tomget it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a gift. She has worn this perfume for years and could not find it anywhere. She loves it! No complaints.</li>
            <li> I purchased the perfume as a gift. When I opened the package I could strongly smell the perfume and discovered that it had leaked out of the top of the bottle onto the bottle, box, and packaging. Some of the perfume was missing as a result of this. If I was purchasing this for myself, it wouldn&#x27;t have been as big of a concern, but it was embarassing giving it to someone as a gift with some of it missing.</li>
            <li> wife&#x27;s favorite..great stocking stuffer..Price was good also.Love the smell of it on my wife. Will buy again for her or should I say me :)</li>
