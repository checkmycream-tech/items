            <li>You will love it!</li>
            <li>My teens love using this!</li>
            <li>I noticed how easy it came off will continue to use the product it works great</li>
            <li>are my honest opinions after having tried this product</li>
            <li>Highly effective in removing waterproof mascara &amp; eye liner.</li>
            <li>gave it 3 stars for how well it removes make up, how nicely it smells, and how well the company packaged their product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I received a sample product from the manufacturer for evaluation and my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>I can honestly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would have given this product 5 stars if it contained a nice smell</li>
            <li>A sample for review was provided, and I have given my honest opinion of the product.bt</li>
            <li>A sample for review was provided, and I have given my honest opinion of the product.</li>
            <li>This is really effective.</li>
            <li>I like a good smokey eye in the evening, and have been searching for a nice light cleanser to help wash it off every night.  </li>
            <li>Very easy on my skin.</li>
            <li>I love this product and I am sure you will too!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best makeup remover she has ever used -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really impressed by this all natural makeup remover.</li>
            <li>I would give this a full 5 stars but taking away 2 stars for the annoyance and delays in not getting this to me overnighted – which I paid for!!</li>
            <li>This one is easy to use, lightweight and gets the job done!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the best makeup remover my wife has used in the last 20 years, and she used to own a cosmetics/beauty products store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A makeup remover that is full of amazing ingredients and strengthens eyelashes isn&#x27;t any good if it won&#x27;t do the job, so my daughter and I decided to put it to the test and give you the best review possible.</li>
            <li>It also works great with q-tips for those eyeliner mishaps and not ruining the whole eye!</li>
            <li>It is very smooth, but it is oil free, and it has not made my sensititive skin break out!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to put any more harmful ingredients on my body.  </li>
            <li>Most eye makeup removers still leave eye makeup and mascara on</li>
            <li>My eyes thank you. :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used others for many years, and I wanted to try something &amp;#34;stronger&amp;#34; because every morning  I found residual evidence that all my eye makeup hadn&#x27;t been removed.  </li>
            <li>You also get a lot more product for the money.</li>
            <li>I love the way this works and oil free too!</li>
            <li>Got her this mostly to prove a point</li>
            <li>I could not have found a better product.</li>
            <li>Love love love it</li>
            <li>My favorite - don&#x27;t like to use anything else.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing better for taking off eye makeup.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more</li>
            <li>I feel comfortable with my daughter using this product and have already purchased another bottle for myself, so know this is an honest and tested review</li>
            <li>It smells refreshing and even feels refreshing.</li>
            <li>Love the remover and does not sting my eyes</li>
            <li>and i love the smell.</li>
            <li>I was not to sure how a water based make up remover would work.</li>
            <li>so I just have to make sure</li>
            <li>The one thing I love about this is that there is No disgusting toxic ingredients that harm your skin.</li>
            <li>Love that Its a product without all those harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this makeup remover.</li>
            <li>Overall great product!!</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using it at our house for about a month now and can say unequivocably that this is our favorite brand and product.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think I wear a ton of makeup--just eyeliner and mascara on both the top and bottom.</li>
            <li>I find this eye makeup remover is better for makeup touchup, with a q-tip.  </li>
            <li>I love using this eye makeup remover because it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily film on my eyes afterwards.</li>
            <li>This is great stuff, comparable to Neutrogena&#x27;s oil free eye makeup remover but higher quality and healthier ingredients.</li>
            <li>She hates putting on makeup but refused to go to nice restaurants without going the full 9 yards.</li>
            <li>This remover quickly and effectively removed my waterproof mascara, waterproof liquid liner, and all of my eye shadow without me having to scrub my eyes and lose lashes in the process.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s safe and easy to use, and seems to work as advertised.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and remove make up good plus it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li>Great natural eye makeup remover!</li>
            <li>Great stuff, works super well, really leaves no trace!</li>
            <li>After reading such wonderful reviews, I was excited to try this eye makeup remover.  </li>
            <li>So, I can&#x27;t say for sure how it works for someone who wears a lot of eye makeup, but if you wear a light to medium amount, this will work for you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this has been a wonderful product to remove eye makeup without leaving residue, oil, or makeup behind.sily, and really not leave any trace of cleaner product or makeup</li>
            <li>It works quickly and effectively and I am a huge fan of this line of products made by Vi-Tae.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s true!</li>
            <li>Mascara came off easily with no eye irritation.</li>
            <li>and they didn’t clean well and most would sting my eyes and irritate the skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how easy it was to remove my eye makeup with this.</li>
            <li>I am beyond happy with this product and it has become an instant favorite.</li>
            <li>This gets your makeup off really easy.</li>
            <li>it is very mild and works, but I still prefer my oil to remove eye make up.</li>
            <li>Easily remove eye makeup without stinging.</li>
            <li>This product did not sting my eyes and was easy to use.</li>
            <li>The mascara and eyeliner came off easily.</li>
            <li>This product is easy and it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling on my face.</li>
            <li>I just follow the directions and it all comes off easily.</li>
            <li>I love that this is a natural product, and it smells really good.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t have the strong chemical scent that some makeup removers have.</li>
            <li>It is a very good product that works, and the bottle will last for awhile too, making it worth the price!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very good eye make up remover, very gentle to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Product does 2onders on fine wrinkles, maybe the orang extract notvsure</li>
            <li>/&gt;*****i received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased review</li>
            <li>This natural, oil free formula is perfect for my sensitive eye area.</li>
            <li>but after she used this last night and started going on and on about it today I decided I should jump on here and write a review to let others know it works well and is a great value.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s been asking for a makeup remover, but I didnt feel comfortable having her use my products once I looked at the ingredients...</li>
            <li>I like the light texture of this eye make up remover</li>
            <li>This downward wiping motion is ok for removing the top liner and mascara, but it doesn&#x27;t do much to remove my bottom lash mascara or bottom lid eyeliner.</li>
            <li>The company is very responsive as well, making sure their customers are satisfied.</li>
            <li>It also smells wonderful, no strong chemical or oil</li>
            <li>I researched every ingredient I could, and this one is truly all natural, pure and pretty much perfect all around.</li>
            <li>It has never been easier / so fast to wash and remove makeup before!!!</li>
            <li>This makeup remover really does remove all of my makeup very easily</li>
            <li>Love this product - very gentle and really works! :)</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product..</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited I found this eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>When it came in the mail (super quickly, might I add!)</li>
            <li>Most of the make up is on the pad and off my eyes the first swipe.</li>
            <li>Leaves face feeling clean and not greasy.</li>
            <li>works well to clean off eye makeup</li>
            <li>I felt clean after using it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know how it can clean the eye area and condition it if it stings when you apply it.</li>
            <li>After my makeup was removed, my skin did not feel oily or irritated, it felt clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>this product -- applied using a q-tip -- it came off cleanly.</li>
            <li>I dip a q-tip into the bottle and clean up my mascara mistakes.</li>
            <li>Maybe I just have a sensitivity to it, as it seems most other folks are having good results.</li>
            <li>Takes it right off, though!</li>
            <li>I used it with my makeup remover cloths by placing it on the cloth and rubbed gently, and it got more off than my cloths ever did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably buy this again because I haven&#x27;t found anything better for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>NOT OILY... smells good only downside...</li>
            <li>It also does a good job removing both eye and surrounding makeup, giving it solid utility.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good enough to get my waterproof mascara off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really looking forward to trying more Vi-Tae products.</li>
            <li>There are so many products out there that do so much damage to your skin and your health.</li>
            <li>I would have appreciated a refreshing scent.</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of milder ingredients being used near my eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that this is all natural and oil free.</li>
            <li>but it went away quickly.</li>
            <li>Using a cotton eye pad, I applied some of this remover to my eyes and quickly removed my mascara, liner and eye shadow in one swipe.  </li>
            <li>This makeup remover was oil free which is nice, also left no residue and didnt sting eyes, and works well with non-sunscreen or non-waterproof, long-wearing makeup.  </li>
            <li>My wife has used it now several times and is very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>am left with a nice clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and takes off all of my makeup quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>I love to use all natural products specially when it comes to my face and eye area.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this was going to be my new favorite, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li>Without much effort from me it easily removed my make up.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes and have been able to use it.</li>
            <li>Love the all natural products!</li>
            <li>No Trace Eye Makeup Remover does exactly what it claims to!</li>
            <li>It also gentle on the eyes which is important as a contact lens wearer.</li>
            <li>Does the job (maybe even better than my old remover) and no harmful side effects or reactions.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>bottle is wonderful - a tall thin brown plastic bottle with a flip cap.</li>
            <li>have been through 3 different brands, all claiming to be great with Sensitive Skin (Oil of Olay, Mary Kay, ...</li>
            <li>I like natural products because they are better for you than things with chemicals.</li>
            <li>When I seen this all natural product with ingredients that were actually healthy for both of our skin</li>
            <li>I do like the idea that it&#x27;s all natural and is supposed to fight wrinkles, but I just wish that I liked the actual product more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this has been a wonderful product to remove eye makeup without leaving residue, oil, or makeup behind.</li>
            <li>Even though I was excited to try it, I was not really expecting much as I’ve tried many, many eye makeup removers over the years</li>
            <li>Expensive for the size, love the ingredients, and works good on non waterproof makeup!</li>
            <li>My eye shadow and liner came right off in one swipe, mascara didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Bought it for my sister who loves to wear eye makeup and it slides right off her face.</li>
            <li>The description and some of the reviews make it sound close to miraculous for makeup removal, but I honestly don&#x27;t find it to be any better than other products, many of which are less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin around my eyes and it can be easily irritated by eye make-up removers.  </li>
            <li>This is an effective, gentle eye makeup remover, one free of endless chemicals/oils and safe for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I find it works best on days when I wear eyeliner only, but I do still experience the slight stinging.</li>
            <li>It does not smear the mascara onto her skin, leaves no residue, does not irritate the skin (very mild), does not feel oily, has no smell, is very soothing, and moisturizes the skin very well.</li>
            <li>very gentle but clean very well</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make around my eyes feel sticky or dry us it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this easily removes the make-up around my eyes without irritation.</li>
            <li>I was super excited about trying this product, as I&#x27;m always trying to find something that will effectively remove my make up without having to scrub the delicate eye area.</li>
            <li>The reason for all the excitement, Leave No Trace leaves no oil behind, it cools when it works, and it feels great (all those great extracts - green tea, chamomile, orange, and cucumber - all relaxing soothing products).</li>
            <li>Love it and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>(Get Refreshed facial scrub) for over a year now and LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>I have used the product several times and it seems to be working ok.  </li>
            <li>it also brightens my skin and it feels smooth and soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>Exact quote: &amp;#34;Takes</li>
            <li>/&gt;The current eye makeup remover is Maybelline Expert Eyes, before that Estee Lauder was in the house (that was just 500 times the cost and not that much better than Expert Eyes).</li>
            <li>;) I have also included pictures of the ingredient lable.</li>
            <li>This felt a lot like the ineffective Neutrogena stuff that I have used before (that also stung exactly like this)...</li>
            <li>The first time I used this to remove my eye makeup</li>
            <li>I would rather use something natural vs filled with chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Your results may be different as there are so many varieties of makeup and application of it...</li>
            <li>I was also surprised that the smell wasn&#x27;t to strong, I can spend less time removing my makeup and more time with my husband!</li>
            <li>(I have so many allergies I have to be super careful) and it did not irritate my skin at all.  </li>
            <li>If this product does leave a residue, it&#x27;s barely noticeable, and easily removes the blackest eye makeup with ease.</li>
            <li>this is the first makeup remover to clean my eye lids so completely, so easily, and really not leave any trace of cleaner product or makeup</li>
            <li>The makeup came off, my eye was not irritated, and there was zero burning or reaction of any kind to my eye lids which other reviewers describe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makeup comes off quickly without the greasy feeling that so many other products have.</li>
            <li>I just gently massaged it into my lashes and lids and I was able to open my eyes without the product burning my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have never found something that could come close to taking it off as well as my beloved DHC deep cleansing oil, but this definitely matches it!</li>
            <li>I have a few other of their products and they are all great!  </li>
            <li>I would say this is almost as good as the Neutrogena we usually use.</li>
            <li>It removes makeup easily with ingredients that actually help, and not harm, your skin.</li>
            <li>Like lots of folks, the skin around eye is super sensitive.</li>
            <li>but this product is so pure the it doesn&#x27;t sting or burn.</li>
            <li>As another reviewer stated I am at a loss for how this is rated so high...unless the above are not a big deal for you you will totally love it!</li>
            <li>squeezes a little on a cotton pad and use it to remove eye makeup, and it does an amazing job.</li>
            <li>Finding a good eye makeup remover is sometimes not easy, especially an all natural, oil free and gentle one!  </li>
            <li>Before I tried this I used coconut oil or clinique makeup remover, this one is gentle, I prefer the way it feels on my skin and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>but it really burns.</li>
            <li>This works really well at removing my eye makeup.</li>
            <li>but when you start researching you find that they really are not.</li>
            <li>– it really is a win-win.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely at a loss how this product has almost five stars.</li>
            <li>I really like this eye makeup remover.  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions and saturated a cotton ball, then held it to my eyelid for 15 seconds before gently wiping, not rubbing, or else as the bottle states makeup could get into my eyes and sting.</li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re tired after a night on the town, cotton wool and this great eye make up remover is the way forward-</li>
            <li>It really was not working at allso</li>
            <li>Gentle.</li>
            <li>The product is described as gentle and non-irritating..</li>
            <li>Cleans off all the makeup and is gentle to my eyes and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really liking this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m very enthused about the product.</li>
            <li>(FYI for contact wearers: the stinging is no worse when wearing contacts vs. not wearing them.)</li>
            <li>When I used this soaked on a cotton ball, it did not remove all my makeup (and I don&#x27;t wear much nor do I wear waterproof) and also made my eyes sting quite a bit.  </li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t leave a trace...</li>
            <li>Removes every trace of makeup gently.</li>
            <li>I even put on thicker liner, mascara, and covered my whole lid up to the brow with both powder and stick makeup.  </li>
            <li>gently wipe).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also important for me to use an eye makeup remover that is designed for sensitive skin, since I have a tendency to break out near my eyelids. &#x27;</li>
            <li>Also it works fine on make up that has mostly rubbed off anyway, but if it is makeup that has been applied within 4 or so hours it leaves some serious traces.</li>
            <li>The smell was so much better than any of the other removers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it the first night and was really surprised at how well it removed my mascara and eyeliner without any chemicals or oils!  </li>
            <li>It left no raccoon eye residue and my lashes were completely clean.</li>
            <li>The eye makeup remover is very easy to use all you have to do is apply a small amount on a cotton pad close your eyes and rest the cotton pad gently on your eye area for 15 seconds then gently stroke eye area downwards until eye makeup dissolves and is removed.</li>
            <li>I say hunting because it really is a hunt to find REALLY 100% all natural products these days.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy , removed quickly and easy my waterproof mascara do not need scrub hard..</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this makeup remover to people that want a natural product that is really tough.&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle (my skin is sensitive)</li>
            <li>I love the ingredients of cucumber, green tea powder, chamomile powder and aloe vera powder to cleanse and hydrate the area around my eyes.</li>
            <li>In fact, I don&#x27;t normally wear mascara because even with baby oil, removing it irritates my skin.</li>
            <li>Mrs. Dan rarely gets excited about make up products, they usually just work or they don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>(I can’t live without my mascara and eye shadow).  </li>
            <li>Very easy to remove all my makeup without rubbing hard.</li>
            <li>Overall it takes quite a bit more effort to &amp;#34;leave no trace&amp;#34; than I expected it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>highly recommend it because it&#x27;s all natural and also because it works.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Super easy to use and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>usually natural products don&#x27;t remove waterproof makeup, but IT WORKS!</li>
            <li>I often get a reaction to many soaps/lotions/makeup where my eye lid will get inflamed in a small spot: it reminds me a patch of hives but on my eyelid.  </li>
            <li>The bottle&#x27;s retail price is a bit higher than I would like to pay, especially if I hadn&#x27;t used it before.</li>
            <li>have this company&#x27;s facial scrub on its way now (desperate to find a brand that will work for my skin in general), so hopefully that&#x27;ll work out just as awesome.</li>
            <li>Does sting a little bit if you rub it on, so be sure to follow the instructions and soak a cotton ball and set it on your eye for several seconds to dissolve the eye makeup.</li>
            <li>so it is clearly the product not my makeup that is setting fire to my eyes.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s a natural beauty and doesn&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup.</li>
            <li>My skin felt soft and somehow healed from the torture I put it through</li>
            <li>My lashes felt so soft after using this too.</li>
            <li>was feeling my skin react to my old eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sensitive to the product.</li>
            <li>is is all natural.</li>
            <li>All natural.</li>
            <li>All of my products are now turning natural.</li>
            <li>Lots claim to be all natural</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin and it did not bother it at all</li>
            <li>, I couldn&#x27;t rinse my face fast enough.</li>
            <li>Once I received this all natural make up remover</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and had been using Almay make up remover.</li>
            <li>I tried various types of cotton pads etc with this product and wasn&#x27;t having much luck.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t yet decided if I&#x27;ll purchase again since I really would only need to use with waterproof makeup.  </li>
            <li>So far I like it.</li>
            <li>I can touch up my makeup if I make a mistake without having to start completely over.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>far as I can tell, it works well.</li>
            <li>I dabbed a tissue gently to the corner of my eye and along the lid and within a very short time</li>
            <li>I never felt irritation, burning or discomfort for that matter (and this surprised me as I was expecting it to hurt in some form or another).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I dabbed a tissue gently to the corner of my eye and along the lid and within a very short time</li>
            <li>I never felt irritation, burning or discomfort for that matter (and this surprised me as I was expecting it to hurt in some form or another).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not horribly, but enough so that I don&#x27;t want to use it everyday.</li>
            <li>I had given up wearing mascera because of the annoyance of being able to get it off at night when I&#x27;m tired and ready for bed.</li>
            <li>and there is little reason to get excited.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this eye makeup remover since I really like the other products this company offers.</li>
            <li>I love my Vitae and will be purchasing regularly, although the 4.46 ounce bottle will last a long time, even with daily use.</li>
            <li>Just a little bit on cotton wipes everything clean, and leave your skin refreshed.</li>
            <li>The results were the same: the upper lid gets completely cleaned off in the first try.  </li>
            <li>I need to use other products to help clean whatever it left</li>
            <li>It is easy to use just a few drops and fits perfectly in smaller hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a review sample.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a gentle, non-irritating natural makeup remover just for my eyes and just recently discovered Leave No Trace on Amazon last month and bought it with anticipation.  </li>
            <li>Bigger bottle than I normally get at the store.</li>
            <li>I was excited, but that&#x27;s only half the battle.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a big deal when I used regular mascara because I could just clean it up with a wet q-tip.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t oily or greasy and dried quickly.</li>
            <li>This works well to take off makeup in a few quick swipes and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
            <li>The fact we received them for free has no bearing on our review, and we have written negative reviews in the past for products we were sent for free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not only using it myself, but have a young teenage daughter new to the world of makeup that is using it too.</li>
            <li>Completely non irritating, natural, easy -- I&#x27;m hooked!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>In looking for something less chemically harsh and more natural I came across Leave No Trace</li>
            <li>I saw the Leave No Trace makeup remover by chance on Amazon when I was searching for a different product, and it said it was All Natural &amp; Non-Irritating.  </li>
            <li>O.O</li>
            <li>This remover intrigued me initially because it was all natural.  </li>
            <li>the upper lid gets completely cleaned for me each and every time.  </li>
            <li>After opening it, I smelled it and hoped for something nice, but unfortunately did not find any smell to the product.  </li>
            <li>Most removers leave behind a bit of mascara.</li>
            <li>The only ill I experienced was the need to blink several times as there was \\&quot;foreign matter\\&quot; in my eye.  </li>
            <li>The only ill I experienced was the need to blink several times as there was \\&quot;foreign matter\\&quot; in my eye.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m positive I&#x27;m not getting makeup or remover into my eyes, but every time I use the remover my eyes sting slightly for a couple minutes.</li>
            <li>I thought, &amp;#34;OK, well maybe the burning just means it&#x27;s effective.&amp;#34; But no, after rubbing my eyes extensively, there was barely any makeup on the cotton.</li>
            <li>which was my main problem with other eye area makeup removers.</li>
            <li>It does not clean very well on my eye.</li>
            <li>All I do is squirt a little on a cotton pad, rest the pad on my eye lid and lashes for about 15 seconds and gently wipe.</li>

            <li> This is really effective.</li>

            <li> Very easy on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I am sure you will too!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best makeup remover she has ever used -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed by this all natural makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I would give this a full 5 stars but taking away 2 stars for the annoyance and delays in not getting this to me overnighted – which I paid for!!</li>
            <li> This one is easy to use, lightweight and gets the job done!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the best makeup remover my wife has used in the last 20 years, and she used to own a cosmetics/beauty products store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A makeup remover that is full of amazing ingredients and strengthens eyelashes isn&#x27;t any good if it won&#x27;t do the job, so my daughter and I decided to put it to the test and give you the best review possible.</li>
            <li> It also works great with q-tips for those eyeliner mishaps and not ruining the whole eye!</li>
            <li> It is very smooth, but it is oil free, and it has not made my sensititive skin break out!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to put any more harmful ingredients on my body.  </li>
            <li> Most eye makeup removers still leave eye makeup and mascara on</li>
            <li> My eyes thank you. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used others for many years, and I wanted to try something &amp;#34;stronger&amp;#34; because every morning  I found residual evidence that all my eye makeup hadn&#x27;t been removed.  </li>
            <li> You also get a lot more product for the money.</li>
            <li> I love the way this works and oil free too!</li>
            <li> Got her this mostly to prove a point</li>
            <li> I could not have found a better product.</li>
            <li> Love love love it</li>
            <li> My favorite - don&#x27;t like to use anything else.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing better for taking off eye makeup.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more</li>
            <li> I feel comfortable with my daughter using this product and have already purchased another bottle for myself, so know this is an honest and tested review</li>
            <li> It smells refreshing and even feels refreshing.</li>
            <li> Love the remover and does not sting my eyes</li>
            <li> and i love the smell.</li>
            <li> I was not to sure how a water based make up remover would work.</li>
            <li> so I just have to make sure</li>
            <li> The one thing I love about this is that there is No disgusting toxic ingredients that harm your skin.</li>
            <li> Love that Its a product without all those harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Overall great product!!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using it at our house for about a month now and can say unequivocably that this is our favorite brand and product.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think I wear a ton of makeup--just eyeliner and mascara on both the top and bottom.</li>
            <li> I find this eye makeup remover is better for makeup touchup, with a q-tip.  </li>
            <li> I love using this eye makeup remover because it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily film on my eyes afterwards.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff, comparable to Neutrogena&#x27;s oil free eye makeup remover but higher quality and healthier ingredients.</li>
            <li> She hates putting on makeup but refused to go to nice restaurants without going the full 9 yards.</li>
            <li> This remover quickly and effectively removed my waterproof mascara, waterproof liquid liner, and all of my eye shadow without me having to scrub my eyes and lose lashes in the process.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s safe and easy to use, and seems to work as advertised.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and remove make up good plus it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li> Great natural eye makeup remover!</li>
            <li> Great stuff, works super well, really leaves no trace!</li>
            <li> After reading such wonderful reviews, I was excited to try this eye makeup remover.  </li>
            <li> So, I can&#x27;t say for sure how it works for someone who wears a lot of eye makeup, but if you wear a light to medium amount, this will work for you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this has been a wonderful product to remove eye makeup without leaving residue, oil, or makeup behind.sily, and really not leave any trace of cleaner product or makeup</li>
            <li> It works quickly and effectively and I am a huge fan of this line of products made by Vi-Tae.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s true!</li>
            <li> Mascara came off easily with no eye irritation.</li>
            <li> and they didn’t clean well and most would sting my eyes and irritate the skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how easy it was to remove my eye makeup with this.</li>
            <li> I am beyond happy with this product and it has become an instant favorite.</li>
            <li> This gets your makeup off really easy.</li>
            <li> it is very mild and works, but I still prefer my oil to remove eye make up.</li>
            <li> Easily remove eye makeup without stinging.</li>
            <li> This product did not sting my eyes and was easy to use.</li>
            <li> The mascara and eyeliner came off easily.</li>
            <li> This product is easy and it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling on my face.</li>
            <li> I just follow the directions and it all comes off easily.</li>
            <li> I love that this is a natural product, and it smells really good.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t have the strong chemical scent that some makeup removers have.</li>
            <li> It is a very good product that works, and the bottle will last for awhile too, making it worth the price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good eye make up remover, very gentle to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Product does 2onders on fine wrinkles, maybe the orang extract notvsure</li>
            <li> /&gt;*****i received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased review</li>
            <li> This natural, oil free formula is perfect for my sensitive eye area.</li>
            <li> but after she used this last night and started going on and on about it today I decided I should jump on here and write a review to let others know it works well and is a great value.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s been asking for a makeup remover, but I didnt feel comfortable having her use my products once I looked at the ingredients...</li>
            <li> I like the light texture of this eye make up remover</li>
            <li> This downward wiping motion is ok for removing the top liner and mascara, but it doesn&#x27;t do much to remove my bottom lash mascara or bottom lid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> The company is very responsive as well, making sure their customers are satisfied.</li>
            <li> It also smells wonderful, no strong chemical or oil</li>
            <li> I researched every ingredient I could, and this one is truly all natural, pure and pretty much perfect all around.</li>
            <li> It has never been easier / so fast to wash and remove makeup before!!!</li>
            <li> This makeup remover really does remove all of my makeup very easily</li>
            <li> Love this product - very gentle and really works! :)</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product..</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited I found this eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> When it came in the mail (super quickly, might I add!)</li>
            <li> Most of the make up is on the pad and off my eyes the first swipe.</li>
            <li> Leaves face feeling clean and not greasy.</li>
            <li> works well to clean off eye makeup</li>
            <li> I felt clean after using it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how it can clean the eye area and condition it if it stings when you apply it.</li>
            <li> After my makeup was removed, my skin did not feel oily or irritated, it felt clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> this product -- applied using a q-tip -- it came off cleanly.</li>
            <li> I dip a q-tip into the bottle and clean up my mascara mistakes.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just have a sensitivity to it, as it seems most other folks are having good results.</li>
            <li> Takes it right off, though!</li>
            <li> I used it with my makeup remover cloths by placing it on the cloth and rubbed gently, and it got more off than my cloths ever did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably buy this again because I haven&#x27;t found anything better for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> NOT OILY... smells good only downside...</li>
            <li> It also does a good job removing both eye and surrounding makeup, giving it solid utility.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s good enough to get my waterproof mascara off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really looking forward to trying more Vi-Tae products.</li>
            <li> There are so many products out there that do so much damage to your skin and your health.</li>
            <li> I would have appreciated a refreshing scent.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of milder ingredients being used near my eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that this is all natural and oil free.</li>
            <li> but it went away quickly.</li>
            <li> Using a cotton eye pad, I applied some of this remover to my eyes and quickly removed my mascara, liner and eye shadow in one swipe.  </li>
            <li> This makeup remover was oil free which is nice, also left no residue and didnt sting eyes, and works well with non-sunscreen or non-waterproof, long-wearing makeup.  </li>
            <li> My wife has used it now several times and is very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> am left with a nice clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and takes off all of my makeup quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> I love to use all natural products specially when it comes to my face and eye area.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this was going to be my new favorite, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Without much effort from me it easily removed my make up.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes and have been able to use it.</li>
            <li> Love the all natural products!</li>
            <li> No Trace Eye Makeup Remover does exactly what it claims to!</li>
            <li> It also gentle on the eyes which is important as a contact lens wearer.</li>
            <li> Does the job (maybe even better than my old remover) and no harmful side effects or reactions.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> bottle is wonderful - a tall thin brown plastic bottle with a flip cap.</li>
            <li> have been through 3 different brands, all claiming to be great with Sensitive Skin (Oil of Olay, Mary Kay, ...</li>
            <li> I like natural products because they are better for you than things with chemicals.</li>
            <li> When I seen this all natural product with ingredients that were actually healthy for both of our skin</li>
            <li> I do like the idea that it&#x27;s all natural and is supposed to fight wrinkles, but I just wish that I liked the actual product more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this has been a wonderful product to remove eye makeup without leaving residue, oil, or makeup behind.</li>
            <li> Even though I was excited to try it, I was not really expecting much as I’ve tried many, many eye makeup removers over the years</li>
            <li> Expensive for the size, love the ingredients, and works good on non waterproof makeup!</li>
            <li> My eye shadow and liner came right off in one swipe, mascara didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my sister who loves to wear eye makeup and it slides right off her face.</li>
            <li> The description and some of the reviews make it sound close to miraculous for makeup removal, but I honestly don&#x27;t find it to be any better than other products, many of which are less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin around my eyes and it can be easily irritated by eye make-up removers.  </li>
            <li> This is an effective, gentle eye makeup remover, one free of endless chemicals/oils and safe for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I find it works best on days when I wear eyeliner only, but I do still experience the slight stinging.</li>
            <li> It does not smear the mascara onto her skin, leaves no residue, does not irritate the skin (very mild), does not feel oily, has no smell, is very soothing, and moisturizes the skin very well.</li>
            <li> very gentle but clean very well</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make around my eyes feel sticky or dry us it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this easily removes the make-up around my eyes without irritation.</li>
            <li> I was super excited about trying this product, as I&#x27;m always trying to find something that will effectively remove my make up without having to scrub the delicate eye area.</li>
            <li> The reason for all the excitement, Leave No Trace leaves no oil behind, it cools when it works, and it feels great (all those great extracts - green tea, chamomile, orange, and cucumber - all relaxing soothing products).</li>
            <li> Love it and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> (Get Refreshed facial scrub) for over a year now and LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> I have used the product several times and it seems to be working ok.  </li>
            <li> it also brightens my skin and it feels smooth and soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> Exact quote: &amp;#34;Takes</li>
            <li> /&gt;The current eye makeup remover is Maybelline Expert Eyes, before that Estee Lauder was in the house (that was just 500 times the cost and not that much better than Expert Eyes).</li>
            <li> ;) I have also included pictures of the ingredient lable.</li>
            <li> This felt a lot like the ineffective Neutrogena stuff that I have used before (that also stung exactly like this)...</li>
            <li> The first time I used this to remove my eye makeup</li>
            <li> I would rather use something natural vs filled with chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Your results may be different as there are so many varieties of makeup and application of it...</li>
            <li> I was also surprised that the smell wasn&#x27;t to strong, I can spend less time removing my makeup and more time with my husband!</li>
            <li> (I have so many allergies I have to be super careful) and it did not irritate my skin at all.  </li>
            <li> If this product does leave a residue, it&#x27;s barely noticeable, and easily removes the blackest eye makeup with ease.</li>
            <li> this is the first makeup remover to clean my eye lids so completely, so easily, and really not leave any trace of cleaner product or makeup</li>
            <li> The makeup came off, my eye was not irritated, and there was zero burning or reaction of any kind to my eye lids which other reviewers describe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makeup comes off quickly without the greasy feeling that so many other products have.</li>
            <li> I just gently massaged it into my lashes and lids and I was able to open my eyes without the product burning my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have never found something that could come close to taking it off as well as my beloved DHC deep cleansing oil, but this definitely matches it!</li>
            <li> I have a few other of their products and they are all great!  </li>
            <li> I would say this is almost as good as the Neutrogena we usually use.</li>
            <li> It removes makeup easily with ingredients that actually help, and not harm, your skin.</li>
            <li> Like lots of folks, the skin around eye is super sensitive.</li>
            <li> but this product is so pure the it doesn&#x27;t sting or burn.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer stated I am at a loss for how this is rated so high...unless the above are not a big deal for you you will totally love it!</li>
            <li> squeezes a little on a cotton pad and use it to remove eye makeup, and it does an amazing job.</li>
            <li> Finding a good eye makeup remover is sometimes not easy, especially an all natural, oil free and gentle one!  </li>
            <li> Before I tried this I used coconut oil or clinique makeup remover, this one is gentle, I prefer the way it feels on my skin and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> but it really burns.</li>
            <li> This works really well at removing my eye makeup.</li>
            <li> but when you start researching you find that they really are not.</li>
            <li> – it really is a win-win.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely at a loss how this product has almost five stars.</li>
            <li> I really like this eye makeup remover.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions and saturated a cotton ball, then held it to my eyelid for 15 seconds before gently wiping, not rubbing, or else as the bottle states makeup could get into my eyes and sting.</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re tired after a night on the town, cotton wool and this great eye make up remover is the way forward-</li>
            <li> It really was not working at allso</li>
            <li> Gentle.</li>
            <li> The product is described as gentle and non-irritating..</li>
            <li> Cleans off all the makeup and is gentle to my eyes and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really liking this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m very enthused about the product.</li>
            <li> (FYI for contact wearers: the stinging is no worse when wearing contacts vs. not wearing them.)</li>
            <li> When I used this soaked on a cotton ball, it did not remove all my makeup (and I don&#x27;t wear much nor do I wear waterproof) and also made my eyes sting quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t leave a trace...</li>
            <li> Removes every trace of makeup gently.</li>
            <li> I even put on thicker liner, mascara, and covered my whole lid up to the brow with both powder and stick makeup.  </li>
            <li> gently wipe).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also important for me to use an eye makeup remover that is designed for sensitive skin, since I have a tendency to break out near my eyelids. &#x27;</li>
            <li> Also it works fine on make up that has mostly rubbed off anyway, but if it is makeup that has been applied within 4 or so hours it leaves some serious traces.</li>
            <li> The smell was so much better than any of the other removers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it the first night and was really surprised at how well it removed my mascara and eyeliner without any chemicals or oils!  </li>
            <li> It left no raccoon eye residue and my lashes were completely clean.</li>
            <li> The eye makeup remover is very easy to use all you have to do is apply a small amount on a cotton pad close your eyes and rest the cotton pad gently on your eye area for 15 seconds then gently stroke eye area downwards until eye makeup dissolves and is removed.</li>
            <li> I say hunting because it really is a hunt to find REALLY 100% all natural products these days.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy , removed quickly and easy my waterproof mascara do not need scrub hard..</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this makeup remover to people that want a natural product that is really tough.&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle (my skin is sensitive)</li>
            <li> I love the ingredients of cucumber, green tea powder, chamomile powder and aloe vera powder to cleanse and hydrate the area around my eyes.</li>
            <li> In fact, I don&#x27;t normally wear mascara because even with baby oil, removing it irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> Mrs. Dan rarely gets excited about make up products, they usually just work or they don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> (I can’t live without my mascara and eye shadow).  </li>
            <li> Very easy to remove all my makeup without rubbing hard.</li>
            <li> Overall it takes quite a bit more effort to &amp;#34;leave no trace&amp;#34; than I expected it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> highly recommend it because it&#x27;s all natural and also because it works.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Super easy to use and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> usually natural products don&#x27;t remove waterproof makeup, but IT WORKS!</li>
            <li> I often get a reaction to many soaps/lotions/makeup where my eye lid will get inflamed in a small spot: it reminds me a patch of hives but on my eyelid.  </li>
            <li> The bottle&#x27;s retail price is a bit higher than I would like to pay, especially if I hadn&#x27;t used it before.</li>
            <li> have this company&#x27;s facial scrub on its way now (desperate to find a brand that will work for my skin in general), so hopefully that&#x27;ll work out just as awesome.</li>
            <li> Does sting a little bit if you rub it on, so be sure to follow the instructions and soak a cotton ball and set it on your eye for several seconds to dissolve the eye makeup.</li>
            <li> so it is clearly the product not my makeup that is setting fire to my eyes.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s a natural beauty and doesn&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup.</li>
            <li> My skin felt soft and somehow healed from the torture I put it through</li>
            <li> My lashes felt so soft after using this too.</li>
            <li> was feeling my skin react to my old eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sensitive to the product.</li>
            <li> is is all natural.</li>
            <li> All natural.</li>
            <li> All of my products are now turning natural.</li>
            <li> Lots claim to be all natural</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin and it did not bother it at all</li>
            <li> , I couldn&#x27;t rinse my face fast enough.</li>
            <li> Once I received this all natural make up remover</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and had been using Almay make up remover.</li>
            <li> I tried various types of cotton pads etc with this product and wasn&#x27;t having much luck.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t yet decided if I&#x27;ll purchase again since I really would only need to use with waterproof makeup.  </li>
            <li> So far I like it.</li>
            <li> I can touch up my makeup if I make a mistake without having to start completely over.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> far as I can tell, it works well.</li>
            <li> I dabbed a tissue gently to the corner of my eye and along the lid and within a very short time</li>
            <li> I never felt irritation, burning or discomfort for that matter (and this surprised me as I was expecting it to hurt in some form or another).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I dabbed a tissue gently to the corner of my eye and along the lid and within a very short time</li>
            <li> I never felt irritation, burning or discomfort for that matter (and this surprised me as I was expecting it to hurt in some form or another).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not horribly, but enough so that I don&#x27;t want to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I had given up wearing mascera because of the annoyance of being able to get it off at night when I&#x27;m tired and ready for bed.</li>
            <li> and there is little reason to get excited.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this eye makeup remover since I really like the other products this company offers.</li>
            <li> I love my Vitae and will be purchasing regularly, although the 4.46 ounce bottle will last a long time, even with daily use.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit on cotton wipes everything clean, and leave your skin refreshed.</li>
            <li> The results were the same: the upper lid gets completely cleaned off in the first try.  </li>
            <li> I need to use other products to help clean whatever it left</li>
            <li> It is easy to use just a few drops and fits perfectly in smaller hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a review sample.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a gentle, non-irritating natural makeup remover just for my eyes and just recently discovered Leave No Trace on Amazon last month and bought it with anticipation.  </li>
            <li> Bigger bottle than I normally get at the store.</li>
            <li> I was excited, but that&#x27;s only half the battle.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a big deal when I used regular mascara because I could just clean it up with a wet q-tip.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t oily or greasy and dried quickly.</li>
            <li> This works well to take off makeup in a few quick swipes and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
            <li> The fact we received them for free has no bearing on our review, and we have written negative reviews in the past for products we were sent for free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not only using it myself, but have a young teenage daughter new to the world of makeup that is using it too.</li>
            <li> Completely non irritating, natural, easy -- I&#x27;m hooked!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> In looking for something less chemically harsh and more natural I came across Leave No Trace</li>
            <li> I saw the Leave No Trace makeup remover by chance on Amazon when I was searching for a different product, and it said it was All Natural &amp; Non-Irritating.  </li>
            <li> O.O</li>
            <li> This remover intrigued me initially because it was all natural.  </li>
            <li> the upper lid gets completely cleaned for me each and every time.  </li>
            <li> After opening it, I smelled it and hoped for something nice, but unfortunately did not find any smell to the product.  </li>
            <li> Most removers leave behind a bit of mascara.</li>
            <li> The only ill I experienced was the need to blink several times as there was \\&quot;foreign matter\\&quot; in my eye.  </li>
            <li> The only ill I experienced was the need to blink several times as there was \\&quot;foreign matter\\&quot; in my eye.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m positive I&#x27;m not getting makeup or remover into my eyes, but every time I use the remover my eyes sting slightly for a couple minutes.</li>
            <li> I thought, &amp;#34;OK, well maybe the burning just means it&#x27;s effective.&amp;#34; But no, after rubbing my eyes extensively, there was barely any makeup on the cotton.</li>
            <li> which was my main problem with other eye area makeup removers.</li>
            <li> It does not clean very well on my eye.</li>
            <li> All I do is squirt a little on a cotton pad, rest the pad on my eye lid and lashes for about 15 seconds and gently wipe.</li>
            <li> I do is wet the cotton pad, hold it against my eye for the count of 15, then gently pull down and sweep outward (toward the temple).  </li>
            <li> It is very gentle on the delicate eye area.</li>
            <li> I use this every night and this bottle will last me quite a long time.</li>
            <li> Just when I received this product for an honest evaluation I started wearing an 18hour eyeliner by Loreal that is very difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> But, very sadly so, a close friend was recently diagnosed with cancer and with all the new research supporting causes of cancer being linked to chemicals in our products I have begun to sing a new tune.</li>
            <li> A tiny but goes a long way!</li>
            <li> left my face dry...</li>
            <li> This bottle should last quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Touche&#x27;, Vi-Tae: solid product, less expensive than Ahava&#x27;s, and arguably better.</li>
            <li> I use it to remove all of my makeup and it glides on easily, leaves no oily residue behind and removes every trace of the makeup!  </li>
            <li> it might take you a second or third go at it (wet the cotton pad, hold 15 seconds,</li>
            <li> I found that wiping my eyelids slowly with a cotton ball or pad that had this remover on it and then going over my eyelids gently with a damp washcloth did the trick.  </li>
            <li> With super slight to no smell and no oily residue left behind, this eye makeup does the job for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When I experimented with this, pushing against the skin too much or pulling down with the pad hard enough to pull the lids apart, the product/makeup residue did indeed get into my eye.  </li>
            <li> When I experimented with this, pushing against the skin too much or pulling down with the pad hard enough to pull the lids apart, the product/makeup residue did indeed get into my eye.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had tried this a long time ago!</li>
            <li> I think this is due to my upper eyelashes covering the lower lid/lashes.  </li>
            <li> When I only pull down, as the directions say to, the lower lid does not get cleaned off.  </li>
            <li> Finally - and thankfully - a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> what disappointed me the most was it left my eyes..</li>
            <li> I found that if I push too hard or pull down too hard, the lower lid will pull away slightly (depends on the pressure used as to how much) from the upper lid, thus exposing the pink soft tissue and/or the eye itself to product/loosened makeup.  </li>

            <li> I keep my eye closed.</li>
            <li> However I did remove 2 stars for claiming this product is non irritating, and for the slightly high price.</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t remember the other one).  </li>
            <li> With other removal methods (soap, cleansers, etc.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how that&#x27;s even possible</li>
            <li> I use other eye makeup removers it often takes rubbing and/or multiple wipes to remove just basic eye liner, and then I have tried some that leave oil on my lid (some leave an oil spill behind), and some are smelly which irritate my nose and make my eyes water.</li>
            <li> However, I find this to be a bit irritating to my very sensitive dyes.  </li>
            <li> All were really heavy on the oil, and it just made me uncomfortable putting those oily solutions right by my eyes</li>
            <li> However waterproof makeup is a little harder to remove.</li>
            <li> Wipes the make-up off without leaving an oily, streaking mess on my face like other removers.  </li>
            <li> Not much is needed, a few drops on a cotton ball.</li>
            <li> The instructions say to put the remover onto a cotton pad and rest it on the eye for 15 seconds, then wipe down.</li>
            <li> Quite frankly, with either way of doing it (pulling down or doing the down and sweep motion)</li>
            <li> Sometimes it will sting slightly</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product that gives me an easier time with less rubbing.</li>
            <li> First, the stuff burned my eyes like crazy when I tried to remove my mascara.</li>
            <li> I always end up making a mess on my eyelids when applying mascara.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand the oily residue left behind by other brands.</li>
            <li> This remover does not leave a greasy residue like other removers that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> It did sting a little, but I have sensitive skin, still not anything bad enough to prevent me from using it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I repeated the process a few times before I used soap to finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It removes all traces and does not leave that oily residue that is left behind so often.</li>
            <li> I had the chance to try the product after having had it for a few days.  </li>
            <li> Tonight I just put a bit on a cotton ball and let it sit on each eye for a few seconds, then just delicately swiped down each eye.</li>
            <li> Not greasy, but does burn your eyes pretty bad.</li>
            <li> Removes makeup gently, and doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> No more smudging.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty disappointed because I did like the claim that it would strengthen my lashes.</li>
            <li> I like the all natural idea behind this makeup remover, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t work as well as I hoped.</li>
            <li> This all natural eye makeup remover has a very faint chamomile smell.</li>
            <li> Never realized how hard that would be...</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s incredibly hard to get my eye make up off.</li>
            <li> but no matter how little I put on a cotton pad it somehow still manages to get in and irritate my eyes even though it says its non irritating.</li>
            <li> Never makes me break out in the least.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I was a bit let down.</li>
            <li> I hate to irritate that delicate skin near the eye.</li>
            <li> so I think that the price is not fair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; eye makeup remover that isn&#x27;t irritating.  </li>
            <li> Takes waterproof mascara off without irritating my eyes.</li>
            <li> I think this works well, but it can be irritating if it gets in your eyes.</li>
            <li> No Trace worked like a charm and did a thorough cleaning job even though it is water based – and without stinging or irritating my eyes!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m obsessed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I&#x27;m allergic to it.</li>
            <li> It did remove my eye make up, however it seems to irritate eyes which is unfortunate as it removes so well</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t like this.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, it did, in fact, leave a trace.  </li>
            <li> I am so bad, I usually fall asleep with my eye makeup on, I know!</li>
            <li> It still stung like crazy</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m always very wary of removers for that area of my face.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re sick of using eye makeup remover that leaves an oily residue, then you need to try this.</li>
            <li> They stung for quite some time. :(</li>
            <li> I hate how it takes forever for me to remove eyeliner and mascara off.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it does not leave my skin feeling oily or with an annoying chemical odor.</li>
            <li> Disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product! Does sting a little bit if you rub it on, so be sure to follow the instructions and soak a cotton ball and set it on your eye for several seconds to dissolve the eye makeup. Takes it right off, though!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this easily removes the make-up around my eyes without irritation. Great product !</li>
            <li> I like to wear two to three coats of mascara and gel eyeliner and those are stubborn to remove. I have been using facial wipes, and while convenient they do not get everything off and by the next morning I look like a raccoon. I love that this is a natural product, and it smells really good. It did sting a little, but I have sensitive skin, still not anything bad enough to prevent me from using it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I used it with my makeup remover cloths by placing it on the cloth and rubbed gently, and it got more off than my cloths ever did. I would highly recommend this makeup remover to people that want a natural product that is really tough.&lt;br /&gt;These are my honest opinions after having tried this product</li>
            <li> Takes away makeup without it getting all over your face.  Leaves face feeling clean and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product.. The directions say to soak a cotton ball, apply to eye for 15 seconds and then wipe makeup off. My eye shadow and liner came right off in one swipe, mascara didn&#x27;t. I repeated the process a few times before I used soap to finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what disappointed me the most was it left my eyes.. sticky! I could feel my eyelashes sticking to my lid after. That was last night, and my eyelashes are still sticky 12 hours later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was not for me.</li>
            <li> Works great and smells great!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product and for a makeup addict like myself I hate how it takes forever for me to remove eyeliner and mascara off. And then washing my face 3-4 times making sure all my foundation comes off, but after testing this omg where has it been?!? It has never been easier / so fast to wash and remove makeup before!!! I take a cotton pad put some of the makeup remover on it and wala! It&#x27;s gone! Talk about a magic trick! 😜 I was also surprised that the smell wasn&#x27;t to strong, I can spend less time removing my makeup and more time with my husband! This is definitely a go to product for all you makeup lovers out there! It also works great with q-tips for those eyeliner mishaps and not ruining the whole eye! Definitely two thumbs up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****i received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased review****</li>
            <li> Burns! If you read the label it warns you should not rub because it will cause your eye makeup to sting your eyes...um...my eye make up has never burned my eyes before so it is clearly the product not my makeup that is setting fire to my eyes. Also it works fine on make up that has mostly rubbed off anyway, but if it is makeup that has been applied within 4 or so hours it leaves some serious traces. As another reviewer stated I am at a loss for how this is rated so high...unless the above are not a big deal for you you will totally love it!</li>
            <li> This a nicest product I try for removed makeup. It is not greasy , removed quickly and easy my waterproof mascara do not need scrub hard.. Loved..</li>
            <li> I love that this is all natural and oil free. I don&#x27;t need to put any more harmful ingredients on my body.  Most eye makeup removers still leave eye makeup and mascara on and this worked like a charm. I love the ingredients of cucumber, green tea powder, chamomile powder and aloe vera powder to cleanse and hydrate the area around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Wipes the make-up off without leaving an oily, streaking mess on my face like other removers.  Finally found one I like,</li>
            <li> I was super excited about trying this product, as I&#x27;m always trying to find something that will effectively remove my make up without having to scrub the delicate eye area. Unfortunately I was a bit let down. I followed the directions meticulously, and ended with with red eyes that burned. Maybe I just have a sensitivity to it, as it seems most other folks are having good results.</li>
            <li> This makeup remover does the job well</li>
            <li> This remover works well. My wife has used it now several times and is very pleased with it. She&#x27;s a natural beauty and doesn&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup. So, I can&#x27;t say for sure how it works for someone who wears a lot of eye makeup, but if you wear a light to medium amount, this will work for you.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, works super well, really leaves no trace! My eyes thank you. :)</li>
            <li> This is the best eye makeup remover I have ever used. Mascara came off easily with no eye irritation. Love it and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> works well to clean off eye makeup</li>
            <li> WOW! I am blown away with this eye makeup remover.  I’ve been using another Vi-Tae product (Get Refreshed facial scrub) for over a year now and LOVE it.  I have been searching for a gentle, non-irritating natural makeup remover just for my eyes and just recently discovered Leave No Trace on Amazon last month and bought it with anticipation.  Even though I was excited to try it, I was not really expecting much as I’ve tried many, many eye makeup removers over the years and they didn’t clean well and most would sting my eyes and irritate the skin around my eyes. What a wonderful surprise!  Vitae Leave No Trace worked like a charm and did a thorough cleaning job even though it is water based – and without stinging or irritating my eyes!  My skin felt soft and somehow healed from the torture I put it through (I can’t live without my mascara and eye shadow).  This is now my go-to cleanser for my eyes. I would give this a full 5 stars but taking away 2 stars for the annoyance and delays in not getting this to me overnighted – which I paid for!! Perhaps I’ll give vitae these stars back if they can FIX their shipping issues.</li>
            <li> Package came when promised and its great! Not oily at all!</li>
            <li> Before I tried this I used coconut oil or clinique makeup remover, this one is gentle, I prefer the way it feels on my skin and would recommend it. It&#x27;s gentle (my skin is sensitive) it doesn&#x27;t have the strong chemical scent that some makeup removers have.</li>
            <li> This makeup remover does the job. It works quickly and effectively and I am a huge fan of this line of products made by Vi-Tae. Everything I have purchased from them has been great. This did get into the corner of my eye and did sting a tiny bit but it went away quickly. It isn&#x27;t oily or greasy and dried quickly. I like this and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This removes makeup but stings my eyes a lot. I was so excited to get it but it really burns.</li>
            <li> Took off waterproof mascara.  Didn&#x27;t burn my eyes with contacts in them.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not convinced that this is the best product on the market.  I&#x27;ve used others for many years, and I wanted to try something &amp;#34;stronger&amp;#34; because every morning  I found residual evidence that all my eye makeup hadn&#x27;t been removed.  However, I find this to be a bit irritating to my very sensitive dyes.  I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; eye makeup remover that isn&#x27;t irritating.  If one wears makeup, one must deal with removing it at the end of the day.  I&#x27;ll probably buy this again because I haven&#x27;t found anything better for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness, I love this eye makeup remover! This remover quickly and effectively removed my waterproof mascara, waterproof liquid liner, and all of my eye shadow without me having to scrub my eyes and lose lashes in the process. This natural, oil free formula is perfect for my sensitive eye area. I can&#x27;t believe how easy it was to remove my eye makeup with this. I just gently massaged it into my lashes and lids and I was able to open my eyes without the product burning my eyes. I could actually see the product melting away my makeup. It left no raccoon eye residue and my lashes were completely clean. With many eye makeup removers I lose lashes and with this I didn&#x27;t lose any! My lashes felt so soft after using this too. It left no greasy feeling that a lot of removers give. I am beyond happy with this product and it has become an instant favorite. *promotional pricing received for testing and review*</li>
            <li> Burns my eyes. Disappointed!</li>
            <li> Expensive for the size, love the ingredients, and works good on non waterproof makeup!</li>
            <li> This gets your makeup off really easy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited I found this eye makeup remover. I can&#x27;t stand the oily residue left behind by other brands. This brand doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue and it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes.</li>
            <li> Completely non irritating, natural, easy -- I&#x27;m hooked!&lt;br /&gt;I was feeling my skin react to my old eye makeup remover. In looking for something less chemically harsh and more natural I came across Leave No Trace and I&#x27;m obsessed. Does the job (maybe even better than my old remover) and no harmful side effects or reactions. You won&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> Great, refreshing, oil-based remover! It&#x27;s awesome, was just hoping it would remove my waterproof mascara. It seems nothing but wipes can remove it!</li>
            <li> I have used the product several times and it seems to be working ok.  I wasn&#x27;t sensitive to the product.</li>
            <li> Takes waterproof mascara off without irritating my eyes.</li>
            <li> I love to use all natural products specially when it comes to my face and eye area. I use this makeup remover daily to remove all of my makeup not just my eye makeup which for me is always the hardest to remove. The eye makeup remover is very easy to use all you have to do is apply a small amount on a cotton pad close your eyes and rest the cotton pad gently on your eye area for 15 seconds then gently stroke eye area downwards until eye makeup dissolves and is removed. I also get another cotton pad and apply some of this makeup remover and remove the rest of my makeup after I&#x27;m done removing the eye makeup. This makeup remover really does remove all of my makeup very easily it also brightens my skin and it feels smooth and soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff, comparable to Neutrogena&#x27;s oil free eye makeup remover but higher quality and healthier ingredients. You also get a lot more product for the money.</li>
            <li> I  had my doubts before purchasing this product cause usually natural products don&#x27;t remove waterproof makeup, but IT WORKS! Not oily, removes  make up perfectly! Def will buy again.</li>
            <li> Works great without a greasy feeling!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and remove make up good plus it&#x27;s natural.👍👏</li>
            <li> Does the job it&#x27;s supposewd to do</li>
            <li> This works really well at removing my eye makeup. I like that is is all natural.</li>
            <li> I think this works well, but it can be irritating if it gets in your eyes.</li>
            <li> Love the all natural products! This one is easy to use, lightweight and gets the job done!</li>
            <li> Love this product, works great with no greasy feeling afterward!</li>
            <li> I love the way this works and oil free too!</li>
            <li> Good makeup remover. NOT OILY... smells good only downside... left my face dry...</li>
            <li> The sadness when Ahava ceased production of its terrific eye makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, Vi-Tae stepped up to the plate. This is an effective, gentle eye makeup remover, one free of endless chemicals/oils and safe for sensitive skin. It also does a good job removing both eye and surrounding makeup, giving it solid utility. Finally - and thankfully - a little goes a long way. This bottle should last quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Touche&#x27;, Vi-Tae: solid product, less expensive than Ahava&#x27;s, and arguably better. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife becuase we have been slacking on date nights. She hates putting on makeup but refused to go to nice restaurants without going the full 9 yards. Got her this mostly to prove a point but after she used this last night and started going on and on about it today I decided I should jump on here and write a review to let others know it works well and is a great value. Exact quote: &amp;#34;Takes the work out of cleaning off eye shadow.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Took my makeup off, but burned my eyes a LOT. They stung for quite some time. :(</li>
            <li> very gentle but clean very well</li>
            <li> it is very mild and works, but I still prefer my oil to remove eye make up. Gave it to my friend and she loves it. All natural.</li>
            <li> Really love this product works great exceeded my  expectations</li>
            <li> Mrs. Dan rarely gets excited about make up products, they usually just work or they don&#x27;t and there is little reason to get excited. The Vi-Tae makeup remover, &amp;#34;Leave No Trace&amp;#34; is a completely different story. This is by far the best makeup remover she has ever used - ultimately, she would buy this by the gallon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The current eye makeup remover is Maybelline Expert Eyes, before that Estee Lauder was in the house (that was just 500 times the cost and not that much better than Expert Eyes). The reason for all the excitement, Leave No Trace leaves no oil behind, it cools when it works, and it feels great (all those great extracts - green tea, chamomile, orange, and cucumber - all relaxing soothing products). It also smells wonderful, no strong chemical or oil smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The remover worked great with a cotton cosmetic pad. No problems with contacts. The smell was so much better than any of the other removers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is wonderful - a tall thin brown plastic bottle with a flip cap. It is easy to use just a few drops and fits perfectly in smaller hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a review sample.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I am a big fan of using old fashion cold cream to remove my eye-makeup - always have been and thought I always would be. But, very sadly so, a close friend was recently diagnosed with cancer and with all the new research supporting causes of cancer being linked to chemicals in our products I have begun to sing a new tune. All of my products are now turning natural. I came across &amp;#34;Leave No Trace&amp;#34; after a night of online &amp;#34;hunting&amp;#34;. I say hunting because it really is a hunt to find REALLY 100% all natural products these days. Lots claim to be all natural but when you start researching you find that they really are not. I researched every ingredient I could, and this one is truly all natural, pure and pretty much perfect all around. I could not have found a better product. When it came in the mail (super quickly, might I add!) I used it the first night and was really surprised at how well it removed my mascara and eyeliner without any chemicals or oils!  I also have sensitive skin and it did not bother it at all – it really is a win-win. I wish I had tried this a long time ago! I will definitely be recommending this eye makeup remover to everyone I know. Great, great product all around!</li>
            <li> Works great. No more smudging. It does sting if you get some in your eye.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I&#x27;m allergic to it. It burns my eyes.</li>
            <li> I like a good smokey eye in the evening, and have been searching for a nice light cleanser to help wash it off every night.  Never realized how hard that would be...&lt;br /&gt;I have been through 3 different brands, all claiming to be great with Sensitive Skin (Oil of Olay, Mary Kay, ...i can&#x27;t remember the other one).  All were really heavy on the oil, and it just made me uncomfortable putting those oily solutions right by my eyes every night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really sensitive skin, and need to be careful what type of cleansers I put on my face.  I saw the Leave No Trace makeup remover by chance on Amazon when I was searching for a different product, and it said it was All Natural &amp; Non-Irritating.  I thought it might make a difference, and it DID!!  Love love love it so far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had zero irritation, as it claims, and it takes care of my eye shadow, liner, and 2 layers of mascara.  WOOT!&lt;br /&gt;I have this company&#x27;s facial scrub on its way now (desperate to find a brand that will work for my skin in general), so hopefully that&#x27;ll work out just as awesome.</li>
            <li> My favorite - don&#x27;t like to use anything else. This works well to take off makeup in a few quick swipes and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue. Never makes me break out in the least. Not oily. There&#x27;s nothing better for taking off eye makeup. I would choose this product a million times over the store brand eye makeup removers with their chemically products that leave somewhat sticky or oily residues. If this product does leave a residue, it&#x27;s barely noticeable, and easily removes the blackest eye makeup with ease. This all natural eye makeup remover has a very faint chamomile smell. This is now the only makeup remover product I use.</li>
            <li> Easily remove eye makeup without stinging.</li>
            <li> Like this product a lot. Not greasy, but does burn your eyes pretty bad. I still like the results of it removing male up though.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy and a pleasant smell. I have very sensitive skin around my eyes and it can be easily irritated by eye make-up removers.  I have had no adverse reactions to the Eye Makeup Remover by Vi Tae. Not much is needed, a few drops on a cotton ball. Highly effective in removing waterproof mascara &amp; eye liner.</li>
            <li> I like natural products because they are better for you than things with chemicals. Vi-Tae has some good products, this one included. It doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;chemically&amp;#34; and does the job without irritants.</li>
            <li> works great. I have a few other of their products and they are all great!  I will be ordering more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with Vitae Leave No Trace Eye Makeup Remover! I&#x27;m not only using it myself, but have a young teenage daughter new to the world of makeup that is using it too. She&#x27;s been asking for a makeup remover, but I didnt feel comfortable having her use my products once I looked at the ingredients... Reading what&#x27;s in that stuff will scare you!! When I seen this all natural product with ingredients that were actually healthy for both of our skin I was excited, but that&#x27;s only half the battle. A makeup remover that is full of amazing ingredients and strengthens eyelashes isn&#x27;t any good if it won&#x27;t do the job, so my daughter and I decided to put it to the test and give you the best review possible. Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased review. As you can see from the included pictures, the Vitae Leave No Trace Eye Makeup Remover does exactly what it claims to! It removes makeup easily with ingredients that actually help, and not harm, your skin. It has a pleasant smell that doesn&#x27;t have the chemical scent that I&#x27;m used to. I feel comfortable with my daughter using this product and have already purchased another bottle for myself, so know this is an honest and tested review ;) I have also included pictures of the ingredient lable. I love my Vitae and will be purchasing regularly, although the 4.46 ounce bottle will last a long time, even with daily use.</li>
            <li> I tried this product one time. It did remove my eye make up, however it seems to irritate eyes which is unfortunate as it removes so well</li>
            <li> This is an eye makeup remover that I will personally recommend. It removes all traces and does not leave that oily residue that is left behind so often. I didn&#x27;t have the need to wash my face afterwards. It smells refreshing and even feels refreshing. Mine came well packed with an inner safety seal. I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely at a loss how this product has almost five stars. First, the stuff burned my eyes like crazy when I tried to remove my mascara. I thought, &amp;#34;OK, well maybe the burning just means it&#x27;s effective.&amp;#34; But no, after rubbing my eyes extensively, there was barely any makeup on the cotton. It was still all on my eyes. This felt a lot like the ineffective Neutrogena stuff that I have used before (that also stung exactly like this)...I threw it away after one use. Would not recommend it at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good eye make up remover, very gentle to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this eye makeup remover.  I use the fiber mascara so it&#x27;s incredibly hard to get my eye make up off. It removes with no hesitation and I don&#x27;t have to scrub.  This remover does not leave a greasy residue like other removers that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Love that this make-up remover is oil free!!! One of the best I&#x27;ve ever used! Excellent seller!!</li>
            <li> A tiny but goes a long way! Great product and will buy again.</li>
            <li> This product is non greasy and works well taking eye makeup off. I have very sensitive eyes so I don&#x27;t use a lot of eye makeup and I&#x27;m always very wary of removers for that area of my face. This product did not sting my eyes and was easy to use. I did have to use it twice to remove of my eyeliner but that&#x27;s not a deal breaker to me. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am so bad, I usually fall asleep with my eye makeup on, I know! Tonight I just put a bit on a cotton ball and let it sit on each eye for a few seconds, then just delicately swiped down each eye. The mascara and eyeliner came off easily. I hate to irritate that delicate skin near the eye. That&#x27;s one way to cause wrinkles. What I really loved that it was not oily or greasy. I felt clean after using it.</li>
            <li> Love this!  I like to pile about 42 coats of mascara on for some reason.  I have never found something that could come close to taking it off as well as my beloved DHC deep cleansing oil, but this definitely matches it!</li>
            <li> The first time I used this to remove my eye makeup I followed the directions and saturated a cotton ball, then held it to my eyelid for 15 seconds before gently wiping, not rubbing, or else as the bottle states makeup could get into my eyes and sting. Well I followed the directions and it still stung my eyes. It did remove my makeup though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day I wore no makeup at all and thought I would give it a try anyways as a test. I poured some onto a couple of cotton balls, held the cotton balls onto my closed eyelids for the 15 seconds as if I was trying to dissolve make up, and wiped gently across my closed lids one time, not rubbing. It still stung like crazy, I couldn&#x27;t rinse my face fast enough. O.O&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 3 stars for how well it removes make up, how nicely it smells, and how well the company packaged their product. However I did remove 2 stars for claiming this product is non irritating, and for the slightly high price. I really wanted to like this eye makeup remover since I really like the other products this company offers. I  like the way this smells and the fact that it is not oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample product from the manufacturer for evaluation and my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> This cleanser does what it says it does,  very good in removing all eye make up.</li>
            <li> When I the eye makeup remover I noticed how easy it came off will continue to use the product it works great</li>
            <li> Love the remover and does not sting my eyes</li>
            <li> Just started using an eye makeup remover and this works great does not leave an oily residue and i love the smell. Product does 2onders on fine wrinkles, maybe the orang extract notvsure but whatever it is works.</li>
            <li> Great product. This makeup remover works well without leaving a greasy feeling. It also gentle on the eyes which is important as a contact lens wearer.</li>
            <li> I was not to sure how a water based make up remover would work. Although I had my doubts, I figured I would give it a shot.  Once I received this all natural make up remover I put it to the test. Without much effort from me it easily removed my make up. I like the fact that it does not leave my skin feeling oily or with an annoying chemical odor. I love this product and I am sure you will too!</li>
            <li> I like the light texture of this eye make up remover and it&#x27;s good enough to get my waterproof mascara off. Sometimes it will sting slightly so I just have to make sure I keep my eye closed. It could even be from some of the mascara getting into my eye?</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re tired after a night on the town, cotton wool and this great eye make up remover is the way forward-</li>
            <li> This product removed my eye shadow and kohl eye liner without a trace. I have not tried it on liquid/gel liners and waterproof mascara. I do intend to try it out on those and update this review.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and had been using Almay make up remover. It really was not working at allso I decided to look for something else. After reading the reviews on Leave No Trace I decided to give it a try. After all I had nothing to lose since there&#x27;s a money back guarantee. I was so impressed with this product. It works so well and no irritation at all. All I do is squirt a little on a cotton pad, rest the pad on my eye lid and lashes for about 15 seconds and gently wipe. Most of the make up is on the pad and off my eyes the first swipe. Super easy to use and a little goes a long way! I use this every night and this bottle will last me quite a long time. I&#x27;m really looking forward to trying more Vi-Tae products.</li>
            <li> The one thing I love about this is that there is No disgusting toxic ingredients that harm your skin. Removes makeup gently, and doesn&#x27;t smell bad. Gentle. Thank you for a wonderful product.There are so many products out there that do so much damage to your skin and your health. Love that Its a product without all those harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> Oh my. This is one of the nicest products out there for removing makeup...Makeup comes off quickly without the greasy feeling that so many other products have.You will love it!</li>
            <li> Excellent eye make up remover that removes all traces of mascara and liner.It is very gentle on the delicate eye area.</li>
            <li> The product is described as gentle and non-irritating.. dissolves all traces of make-up and strengthens lashes, soothes and conditions the eye lid area .  It stings!  Don&#x27;t know how it can clean the eye area and condition it if it stings when you apply it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t like this. It did a so so job of getting off all the mascara but no matter how little I put on a cotton pad it somehow still manages to get in and irritate my eyes even though it says its non irritating. I will not continue to use this and I&#x27;m pretty disappointed because I did like the claim that it would strengthen my lashes. I guess I will never know.</li>
            <li> Just when I received this product for an honest evaluation I started wearing an 18hour eyeliner by Loreal that is very difficult to remove. I tried various types of cotton pads etc with this product and wasn&#x27;t having much luck.  Then I went back to my Bobbie Brown eye makeup remover and that didn&#x27;t work either, so I started trying some different methods.  This remover did not sting my eyes at all (as some of the reviewers have said).  I found that wiping my eyelids slowly with a cotton ball or pad that had this remover on it and then going over my eyelids gently with a damp washcloth did the trick.  I now use it regularly on my eyelids and sometimes go over my face to remove the rest of my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am left with a nice clean feeling.  I can honestly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It does not clean very well on my eye. I need to use other products to help clean whatever it left so I think that the price is not fair.</li>
            <li> Finding a good eye makeup remover is sometimes not easy, especially an all natural, oil free and gentle one!  This remover intrigued me initially because it was all natural.  I would rather use something natural vs filled with chemicals.  Upon receiving this product, I was impressed by the good size of the bottle.  After opening it, I smelled it and hoped for something nice, but unfortunately did not find any smell to the product.  I would have appreciated a refreshing scent. Using a cotton eye pad, I applied some of this remover to my eyes and quickly removed my mascara, liner and eye shadow in one swipe.  It did an excellent job removing my makeup.  After my makeup was removed, my skin did not feel oily or irritated, it felt clean and refreshed.  I would have given this product 5 stars if it contained a nice smell otherwise it did a good job!</li>
            <li> It works well.  Haven&#x27;t yet decided if I&#x27;ll purchase again since I really would only need to use with waterproof makeup.  But, it does work well.</li>
            <li> Good product. I have very sensitive eyes and have been able to use it. Bigger bottle than I normally get at the store.</li>
            <li> Been using this for 2 days. So far I like it. It&#x27;s very similar to the Mary Kay eye makeup removed. I like that I can touch up my makeup if I make a mistake without having to start completely over.</li>
            <li> Great natural eye makeup remover! Bought it for my sister who loves to wear eye makeup and it slides right off her face. I would say this is almost as good as the Neutrogena we usually use.</li>
            <li> Cleans off all the makeup and is gentle to my eyes and non-greasy.  I&#x27;m really liking this product.</li>
            <li> Greatest makeup remover I have ever owned :)</li>
            <li> I tried this product and it burned my eyes.  I of course thought that it was user error.  I re-read the instructions and tried it again, followed them to the letter.  My eyes still burned.  I don&#x27;t think eye make up remover is supposed to burn your eyes.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product from a friend, so I bought it as a gift for my neighbor and she loved it.  She said it &amp;#34;feels great, was simple and not greasy.&amp;#34;  She gave it 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this makeup remover. It doesn&#x27;t make around my eyes feel sticky or dry us it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> This product smells really great like lavender!! It removes eyeshadow eyeliner and mascara well. However waterproof makeup is a little harder to remove. Overall great product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed by this all natural makeup remover. We&#x27;ve been using it at our house for about a month now and can say unequivocably that this is our favorite brand and product. It removes all types of mascara and color with no irritation. There isn&#x27;t any chemical smell because there aren&#x27;t any chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it because it&#x27;s all natural and also because it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample of this product was provided by the manufacturer for review.</li>
            <li> I like the all natural idea behind this makeup remover, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t work as well as I hoped. The description and some of the reviews make it sound close to miraculous for makeup removal, but I honestly don&#x27;t find it to be any better than other products, many of which are less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest concern is that my eyes sting when I use the remover. The bottle says this can happen if you rub (instead of wiping in a downward motion) the makeup remover, but in my experience I get the same result whether rubbing or just wiping downward. I&#x27;m positive I&#x27;m not getting makeup or remover into my eyes, but every time I use the remover my eyes sting slightly for a couple minutes. Not horribly, but enough so that I don&#x27;t want to use it everyday. It&#x27;s like the product has vapors or fumes that waft into my eyes and irritate them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I wear a ton of makeup--just eyeliner and mascara on both the top and bottom. (Not waterproof.) The instructions say to put the remover onto a cotton pad and rest it on the eye for 15 seconds, then wipe down. This downward wiping motion is ok for removing the top liner and mascara, but it doesn&#x27;t do much to remove my bottom lash mascara or bottom lid eyeliner. (Which sort of makes sense...you can&#x27;t remove eyeliner that&#x27;s underneath your bottom eyelashes by just using a downward motion, because your eyelashes get in the way.) Overall it takes quite a bit more effort to &amp;#34;leave no trace&amp;#34; than I expected it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m very enthused about the product. I do like the idea that it&#x27;s all natural and is supposed to fight wrinkles, but I just wish that I liked the actual product more. I find it works best on days when I wear eyeliner only, but I do still experience the slight stinging. (FYI for contact wearers: the stinging is no worse when wearing contacts vs. not wearing them.) I will probably continue to occasionally use the remover, but once this bottle is gone I doubt I&#x27;ll be replacing it. A sample for review was provided, and I have given my honest opinion of the product.bt I&#x27;ll be replacing it. A sample for review was provided, and I have given my honest opinion of the product.</li>
            <li> Finally a product that lets you remove the make-up around your eyes without the risk of burning out your eyeballs! It&#x27;s safe and easy to use, and seems to work as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also not oily at all, which was my main problem with other eye area makeup removers.</li>
            <li> After reading such wonderful reviews, I was excited to try this eye makeup remover.  Unfortunately for me, it did, in fact, leave a trace.  I find this eye makeup remover is better for makeup touchup, with a q-tip.  When I used this soaked on a cotton ball, it did not remove all my makeup (and I don&#x27;t wear much nor do I wear waterproof) and also made my eyes sting quite a bit.  I was hoping this was going to be my new favorite, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Love this product - very gentle and really works! :)</li>
            <li> This product is easy and it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling on my face. Very easy to remove all my makeup without rubbing hard. I have been looking for a product that gives me an easier time with less rubbing. Very easy on my skin. I have sensitive skin and I have no worries.  Great scent. I would recommend this product with 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I had the chance to try the product after having had it for a few days.  I followed the directions and it worked well; although I had to repeat the process.  There was no stinging or itching.  I must note that I had on a double coat of waterproof mascara. There was no issue with the eyeshadow being removed.</li>
            <li> (Disclaimer - My wife and I were invited by the seller to try and review their products. I only agree to these requests when it&#x27;s something we would actually use, and in this case, we picked some products to try and review. The fact we received them for free has no bearing on our review, and we have written negative reviews in the past for products we were sent for free. Also, for this type of invited review, I always begin with a disclaimer.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best makeup remover my wife has used in the last 20 years, and she used to own a cosmetics/beauty products store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She squeezes a little on a cotton pad and use it to remove eye makeup, and it does an amazing job. It does not smear the mascara onto her skin, leaves no residue, does not irritate the skin (very mild), does not feel oily, has no smell, is very soothing, and moisturizes the skin very well. She has been raving about it and recommending it to all her friends ever since she started using it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Clinique&#x27;s product, which works well enough, but when offered this product for review, I agreed to try it. I liked the idea of milder ingredients being used near my eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as I can tell, it works well. I don&#x27;t tend to wear mascara, so the test was on Clinique eyeliner.  With other removal methods (soap, cleansers, etc.) the blue eyeliner just smears everywhere, and stays for days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this product -- applied using a q-tip -- it came off cleanly.</li>
            <li> I always end up making a mess on my eyelids when applying mascara. It wasn&#x27;t a big deal when I used regular mascara because I could just clean it up with a wet q-tip. I recently switched to waterproof, so I have to use makeup remover to fix my mistakes. I had been using Neutrogena brand, but it always left my eyelids greasy. I ordered this product because it said it wasn&#x27;t oily...and it&#x27;s true! I dip a q-tip into the bottle and clean up my mascara mistakes. It really doesn&#x27;t leave a trace...no greasy eyelids! It&#x27;s also great for taking the mascara off at the end of the day. I just follow the directions and it all comes off easily.</li>
            <li> This makeup remover is wonderful!  I use it to remove all of my makeup and it glides on easily, leaves no oily residue behind and removes every trace of the makeup!  I am especially glad that it does not have a scent to it (I have so many allergies I have to be super careful) and it did not irritate my skin at all.  I am sold!</li>
            <li> I love using this eye makeup remover because it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily film on my eyes afterwards. It&#x27;s gentle and takes off all of my makeup quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> This eye makeup remover does a great job of removing all of the makeup. Most removers leave behind a bit of mascara. Smells wonderful too!</li>
            <li> This is really effective. Removes every trace of makeup gently. The company is very responsive as well, making sure their customers are satisfied. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> With super slight to no smell and no oily residue left behind, this eye makeup does the job for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not wear a lot of makeup: lip stick and eye-liner mostly, occasionally mascara. I often get a reaction to many soaps/lotions/makeup where my eye lid will get inflamed in a small spot: it reminds me a patch of hives but on my eyelid.  So, I am cautious when I put things on or around my eyes.  With that being said, I used Leave No Trace! and hoped my eye would not react.  YIPPEE!!  The makeup came off, my eye was not irritated, and there was zero burning or reaction of any kind to my eye lids which other reviewers describe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do is wet the cotton pad, hold it against my eye for the count of 15, then gently pull down and sweep outward (toward the temple).  When I only pull down, as the directions say to, the lower lid does not get cleaned off.  I think this is due to my upper eyelashes covering the lower lid/lashes.  So, this \\&quot;sweeping\\&quot; motion helps the makeup remover get to the lower lid. Quite frankly, with either way of doing it (pulling down or doing the down and sweep motion) the upper lid gets completely cleaned for me each and every time.  I even put on thicker liner, mascara, and covered my whole lid up to the brow with both powder and stick makeup.  The results were the same: the upper lid gets completely cleaned off in the first try.  Your results may be different as there are so many varieties of makeup and application of it... it might take you a second or third go at it (wet the cotton pad, hold 15 seconds, gently wipe).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use other eye makeup removers it often takes rubbing and/or multiple wipes to remove just basic eye liner, and then I have tried some that leave oil on my lid (some leave an oil spill behind), and some are smelly which irritate my nose and make my eyes water. I have not tried every product out there but I have to say...this is the first makeup remover to clean my eye lids so completely, so easily, and really not leave any trace of cleaner product or makeup behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see some reviews talking about how the product might be getting into the eye during use and causing irritation or pain.  I tested different ways of cleaning my eye and for me...I found that if I push too hard or pull down too hard, the lower lid will pull away slightly (depends on the pressure used as to how much) from the upper lid, thus exposing the pink soft tissue and/or the eye itself to product/loosened makeup.  When I experimented with this, pushing against the skin too much or pulling down with the pad hard enough to pull the lids apart, the product/makeup residue did indeed get into my eye.  The only ill I experienced was the need to blink several times as there was \\&quot;foreign matter\\&quot; in my eye.  I dabbed a tissue gently to the corner of my eye and along the lid and within a very short time all was cleared up.  I never felt irritation, burning or discomfort for that matter (and this surprised me as I was expecting it to hurt in some form or another).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this has been a wonderful product to remove eye makeup without leaving residue, oil, or makeup behind.sily, and really not leave any trace of cleaner product or makeup behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see some reviews talking about how the product might be getting into the eye during use and causing irritation or pain.

            <li> My teens love using this!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re sick of using eye makeup remover that leaves an oily residue, then you need to try this. Although I don&#x27;t wear a lot of eye makeup, I need something that will properly remove under eye concealer. It&#x27;s also important for me to use an eye makeup remover that is designed for sensitive skin, since I have a tendency to break out near my eyelids. &#x27;Leave No Trace&#x27; was the answer! Simply dab the solution with a cotton ball or pad, and let it sit on each eyelid for 15 seconds. With just one swipe, all of your eye makeup will come off. You won&#x27;t have to worry about extra rubbing and scrubbing, which is crucial for maintaining the elasticity of your eye area. Whether you wear a lot of makeup, or just need something for the occasional night out, &#x27;Leave No Trace&#x27; is the way to go. Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> This makeup remover was oil free which is nice, also left no residue and didnt sting eyes, and works well with non-sunscreen or non-waterproof, long-wearing makeup.  However it didnt touch my waterproof makeup at all.  It hurt my eyes from all the wiping I had to do to try to get the waterproof makeup off and it didnt budge.</li>
            <li> I had given up wearing mascera because of the annoyance of being able to get it off at night when I&#x27;m tired and ready for bed. This eye makeup remover is great. Just a little bit on cotton wipes everything clean, and leave your skin refreshed. It is very smooth, but it is oil free, and it has not made my sensititive skin break out! The bottle&#x27;s retail price is a bit higher than I would like to pay, especially if I hadn&#x27;t used it before. It is a very good product that works, and the bottle will last for awhile too, making it worth the price!</li>
            <li> Like lots of folks, the skin around eye is super sensitive. In fact, I don&#x27;t normally wear mascara because even with baby oil, removing it irritates my skin. But, this stuff is amazing!  Two cotton balls and all my mascara was gone AND you don&#x27;t have to rinse. It doesn&#x27;t irritate at all!  I&#x27;m not sure how that&#x27;s even possible but this product is so pure the it doesn&#x27;t sting or burn.</li>
