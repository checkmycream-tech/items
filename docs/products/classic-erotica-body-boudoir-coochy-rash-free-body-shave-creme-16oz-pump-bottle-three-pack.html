            <li>Bought for three different people as a gift it was great!</li>
            <li>It is great for men amd women, faces, legs and intimate areas.</li>
            <li>Able to go almost 5days until I have to shave again.</li>
            <li>but when I ran out, I never sought to find more.  </li>

            <li>Product as advertised! :)</li>
            <li>When I ordered everything, the cream got here several days faster than the others and my skin was great with just the cream!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be stocking up with this awesome value!!!!</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Coochy Cream is a good rash free cream to have because it truly is rash free.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The product needs to be packaged better for shipping</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>So I was really glad to find this product because it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or leave me smelling like a man.</li>

            <li>I have been ordering this product for years and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!!!</li>
            <li>Love the scent and the way my skin feels after I shave.</li>
            <li>Make sure to let it sit for a minute or two before shaving</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Actually love them all</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff, however I wish it stayed on the skin better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this product many times.</li>
            <li>This is magic on a tender face.</li>
            <li>We both love using this.</li>
            <li>Your woman will love the smoothness of your shaved head (or....)</li>
            <li>This is my favorite shaving cream for the bikini area.</li>
            <li>Love this shave cream.</li>
            <li>Love the smell too.</li>
            <li>Well I found this great deal (3 huge bottles for ~$30) and jumped right on it.  </li>
            <li>The scent of the Pear Berry was also a nice change from the original product.</li>
            <li>This product is the absolute best for shaving those very intimate areas.</li>
            <li>great deal considering the normal price is more than this for 1/3rd of what your getting here.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping it would work like Coochie from Pure Romance line but its not as good.</li>
            <li>Great on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>No rash or burns and leaves my lady area smooth and tasty for my man:)</li>
            <li>My guy loves how soft I am and how great my lady parts smell and taste.</li>
            <li>Great product for sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly easy to shave off but it gets stuck in the razor.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and this product is amazing!</li>
            <li>It smells nice and it gives me a nice, smooth shave and leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product, that&#x27;s why I ordered 3 more after my first order 2 weeks ago.</li>
            <li>Huge bottles.</li>
            <li>and my everything feels so smooth after I&#x27;m done shaving.  </li>
            <li>It leaves no red bumps either which is great.  </li>
            <li>so smooth</li>
            <li>and I had a smooth sleek shave.  </li>
            <li>Helps prevent razor burn and keeps me feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, protects your skin,no matter where you shave.</li>
            <li>Same product I have used for years and a great bargain at the price for the 3 pack.</li>
            <li>Smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Great deal on the three larger bottles.</li>
            <li>But otherwise, product does a good job when shaving in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>And, the dispenser top on the bottle has to be positioned JUST RIGHT to pump out the cream.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, makes shaving down there a pleasant experience.  </li>
            <li>this is the ONLY thing I will use to shave, it leaves no marks, bumps, irritation, I love this!!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a smooth clean shave.</li>
            <li>This is a new scent which I love!</li>
            <li>its almost like buy 2 get 1 free (with the prices for this product in stores)&lt;br /&gt;Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I bought this item at a local adult store and am so happy I did!!!</li>
            <li>Super smooth skin and no irritation at all.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff and it&#x27;s soooo much cheaper than buying it at the sex shop.</li>
            <li>I only gave 4 stars because one bottle arrived with a cracked/broken top so it doesn&#x27;t have a top anymore</li>
            <li>This is the first product that I have been able to use that keeps my legs smooth and red bump free!</li>
            <li>Like I&#x27;ll apply it all over my calf/shin, but by the time I&#x27;m done with one side of my leg, I have to reapply to the other side because it just kind of slides off or is washed off easily by the light spray coming from the shower.</li>
            <li>I know the name references a use for our &amp;#34;venus&amp;#34; area, but it works great in all other parts of the body!</li>
            <li>Have been so happy to find it on Amazon for literally half the price.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>At first, I thought it was just glorified conditioner, but I had NO bumps afterwards!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>It works VERY well and is comfortable.</li>
            <li>Coochy cream is absolutely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>It tends to go on almost clear when you put it on to shave, however you will be able to see where you have and have not shaved.  </li>
            <li>I buy it for most of my family that have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I rarely nick my skin with this stuff.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>A bottle lasts about 6-8 months so it is well worth the cost.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth purchasing the 3-pack.....</li>
            <li>I use baby oil gel right after shaving.</li>
            <li>this cream makes the tangles slide right out.</li>
            <li>I have been using Coochy for over 10 years and it has always done me right.</li>
            <li>stuff works great too, really cuts down on skin iritation.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to layer on the lotion nearly as much because the shave lotion help s keep my legs soft and smoth.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin or get razor burn easily, I&#x27;d suggest avoiding this product.</li>
            <li>However, this purchase gets a solid 4 stars due to the fact that it arrived quickly, and it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li>I have never tried anything remotely close to this shaving cream, its amazing.  </li>
            <li>If you have never used it before, its completely different than shaving cream and is more of a lotion.  </li>
            <li>this is the first shaving cream that i didn&#x27;t have a ton of razor bumps</li>
            <li>, I bought my first bottle years ago because it made me giggle,I&#x27;ve recommended it to anyone who would listen.</li>
            <li>Once I see a skin product I am interested in, I do a bunch of research before I buy it.</li>
            <li>I have found regular hair conditioners that work better than this garbage.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin so soft and bump free.</li>
            <li>I tried it once as a conditioner for my hair and it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>I would actually check a bag while going on vacation just to be able to bring this cream.</li>
            <li>Shipping was incredibly fast!</li>
            <li>The three bottle set is a great value and lasts a long time (3 bottles in 6 months with daily use).</li>
            <li>My legs feel smooth and soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin soft and silky smooth.</li>
            <li>As a first time buyer I didn&#x27;t know how the product would be</li>
            <li>with all the rave reviews, i had super high hopes for the product.</li>
            <li>After just one use the amount of razor burn/rash is significantly lower - it even helped reduce the redness and soreness of my old razor burn.  </li>
            <li>Washes away cleanly and leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li>, I decided to just slather it everywhere like it was lotion and rinse it off -- my skin was super soft!  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin super soft!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted, thanks</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin super soft.</li>
            <li>Like I said, leaves my skin super soft</li>
            <li>Super soft.</li>
            <li>Anyway, this stuff makes the tuffest of facial hair shave so easily.</li>
            <li>this stuff makes my downstairs super soft and smell like roses.</li>
            <li>I will never pay the high price through Pure Romance again!</li>
            <li>Silly name, she can barely say it without giggling, but the lotion is amazing - and the price was exceptional.  </li>
            <li>Sure, the smell is a little feminine, but it leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth and helps prevent razor burn.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much at all each time you use it, hence why it lasts forever.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>When my friend and I go rafting up in the literally unnamed regions of Maine and packing the minimum is essential my Coochy Cream doubles as conditioner for our hair, works fantastic.</li>
            <li>Product as described, fast shipping</li>
            <li>Fantastic in everyway possible!</li>
            <li>stuff really works.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t realize how much product I had ordered (think hairspray can sized) until it arrived.  </li>
            <li>It rarely irritates my legs, and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My husband uses it to shave and he does not break out as much as before.</li>
            <li>My wife and I use it for those intimate areas.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than anywhere else</li>
            <li>This item works very well</li>
            <li>This coochy Creme really helps in reducing the razor burn</li>
            <li>she loves how soft her skin is, I too enjoy how soft her skin is</li>
            <li>You can definitely tell it has conditioning properties because your skin will be so soft &amp; smooth after you you use the cream!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I followed the recommendation of other reviews and bought this 3-pack.  </li>
            <li>My skin is not only smooth, but very soft as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a dream product and I will have it stocked in my home for as long as it is available</li>
            <li>My legs are still smooth 2 day after shaving and on the 3rd day, just the tiniest bit of (soft) stubble.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly with my prime shipping, but one of the caps were cracked, and the bottles have mysterious markings on them in sharpie.</li>
            <li>My wife used to sell it and got me t try and older bottle...</li>
            <li>A small amount lets your razor glide smoothly and it leaves your skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I will never buy normal shaving cream again.</li>
            <li>this will last for quite a long time :)</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t possibly live without this shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t expect for the cheap price that I&#x27;ll get 3 big bottles this should last me for a while</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t leave my legs super dry like some shaving products do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and every time I used to shave I would always get razor burn, even on my legs.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for those with sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>After first shave with this product, I still have a few bumps but definitely not as many as I normally would, plus it just smells so freaking good.</li>
            <li>Soft silky legs are just a bottle of coochy away!</li>
            <li>i bought this stuff and it helps so much in sensitive places!</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin to shaving and this is the only product that I can use consistently to stop razor burn.  </li>
            <li>I had only ever used the Pure Romance brand, so I was leery to purchase this.</li>
            <li>It made my legs so soft</li>
            <li>I used to get this at an adult store and found this company is a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this makes me legs</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and it still gave me razor bumps on my legs.</li>
            <li>I started using it just for sensitive areas and now use it for my legs as well.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin so soft, and prolongs my time in between having to shave, and DRAMATICALLY reduces the ingrown hairs I get after.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Coody Cream for years now, ever since I bought some at some adult party</li>
            <li>someone who has EXTREMELY sensitive skin in &amp;#34;that&amp;#34; area, I had issues for years with shaving my bikini line.  </li>
            <li>So the three bottles have lasted me nearly a year</li>
            <li>You only need 1-2 pumps for your whole leg</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll pay a lot more elsewhere, or at least the websites where I was looking.</li>
            <li>Pros:&lt;br /&gt;I have been using men&#x27;s shaving gel for sensitive skin for years because all the products made for women irritated my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I can keep my sensitive areas shaved and no bumps or razor burn.  </li>
            <li>On time and was especially surprised on how big the items are.</li>
            <li>My wife and I both have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>but I am completely sold.  </li>
            <li>Keeps skin soft &amp; smoothe.</li>
            <li>Also, I feel like I have to use a LOT of it because it&#x27;s kind of thin.</li>
            <li>i have super sensitive/dry skin esp down there when i shave that i was breaking out in a rash...</li>
            <li>This works GREAT on my facial hair, as I have very sensitive skin and can not normally shave everyday or even every other day.  </li>
            <li>Definitely helps with shaving when skin is sensitive - very soft and does not cause any irritation.</li>
            <li>I use the whole 3 step system with the mist and powder to help further safeguard my sensitive skin, however they are not necessary.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin all over and this is the only product my skin can handle</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and get razor burn pretty easily (down there.)</li>
            <li>The thing that&#x27;s hard to peg is what&#x27;s in it that makes my face so smooth?</li>
            <li>Even then they are very small, not very irritating, &amp; heal quickly.</li>
            <li>I got 3 of the BIG bottles for the price of one at any adult store.</li>
            <li>Only thing is that the plumbing in my house is old</li>
            <li>Great shaving cream without irritating your delicate skin.  </li>
            <li>I tried this product once a few years ago after buying it through Pure Romance.</li>
            <li>I needed a new bottle and my other daughter lost the Coochy Cream when her sister moved.</li>

            <li> Love the smell too.</li>

            <li> The scent of the Pear Berry was also a nice change from the original product.</li>
            <li> This product is the absolute best for shaving those very intimate areas.</li>
            <li> great deal considering the normal price is more than this for 1/3rd of what your getting here.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping it would work like Coochie from Pure Romance line but its not as good.</li>
            <li> Great on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> No rash or burns and leaves my lady area smooth and tasty for my man:)</li>
            <li> My guy loves how soft I am and how great my lady parts smell and taste.</li>
            <li> Great product for sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly easy to shave off but it gets stuck in the razor.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and this product is amazing!</li>
            <li> It smells nice and it gives me a nice, smooth shave and leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, that&#x27;s why I ordered 3 more after my first order 2 weeks ago.</li>
            <li> Huge bottles.</li>
            <li> and my everything feels so smooth after I&#x27;m done shaving.  </li>
            <li> It leaves no red bumps either which is great.  </li>
            <li> so smooth</li>
            <li> and I had a smooth sleek shave.  </li>
            <li> Helps prevent razor burn and keeps me feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, protects your skin,no matter where you shave.</li>
            <li> Same product I have used for years and a great bargain at the price for the 3 pack.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Great deal on the three larger bottles.</li>
            <li> But otherwise, product does a good job when shaving in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> And, the dispenser top on the bottle has to be positioned JUST RIGHT to pump out the cream.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, makes shaving down there a pleasant experience.  </li>
            <li> this is the ONLY thing I will use to shave, it leaves no marks, bumps, irritation, I love this!!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a smooth clean shave.</li>
            <li> This is a new scent which I love!</li>
            <li> its almost like buy 2 get 1 free (with the prices for this product in stores)&lt;br /&gt;Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this item at a local adult store and am so happy I did!!!</li>
            <li> Super smooth skin and no irritation at all.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff and it&#x27;s soooo much cheaper than buying it at the sex shop.</li>
            <li> I only gave 4 stars because one bottle arrived with a cracked/broken top so it doesn&#x27;t have a top anymore</li>
            <li> This is the first product that I have been able to use that keeps my legs smooth and red bump free!</li>
            <li> Like I&#x27;ll apply it all over my calf/shin, but by the time I&#x27;m done with one side of my leg, I have to reapply to the other side because it just kind of slides off or is washed off easily by the light spray coming from the shower.</li>
            <li> I know the name references a use for our &amp;#34;venus&amp;#34; area, but it works great in all other parts of the body!</li>
            <li> Have been so happy to find it on Amazon for literally half the price.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> At first, I thought it was just glorified conditioner, but I had NO bumps afterwards!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> It works VERY well and is comfortable.</li>
            <li> Coochy cream is absolutely worth the money.  </li>
            <li> It tends to go on almost clear when you put it on to shave, however you will be able to see where you have and have not shaved.  </li>
            <li> I buy it for most of my family that have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I rarely nick my skin with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> A bottle lasts about 6-8 months so it is well worth the cost.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth purchasing the 3-pack.....</li>
            <li> I use baby oil gel right after shaving.</li>
            <li> this cream makes the tangles slide right out.</li>
            <li> I have been using Coochy for over 10 years and it has always done me right.</li>
            <li> stuff works great too, really cuts down on skin iritation.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to layer on the lotion nearly as much because the shave lotion help s keep my legs soft and smoth.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin or get razor burn easily, I&#x27;d suggest avoiding this product.</li>
            <li> However, this purchase gets a solid 4 stars due to the fact that it arrived quickly, and it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li> I have never tried anything remotely close to this shaving cream, its amazing.  </li>
            <li> If you have never used it before, its completely different than shaving cream and is more of a lotion.  </li>
            <li> this is the first shaving cream that i didn&#x27;t have a ton of razor bumps</li>
            <li> , I bought my first bottle years ago because it made me giggle,I&#x27;ve recommended it to anyone who would listen.</li>
            <li> Once I see a skin product I am interested in, I do a bunch of research before I buy it.</li>
            <li> I have found regular hair conditioners that work better than this garbage.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin so soft and bump free.</li>
            <li> I tried it once as a conditioner for my hair and it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> I would actually check a bag while going on vacation just to be able to bring this cream.</li>
            <li> Shipping was incredibly fast!</li>
            <li> The three bottle set is a great value and lasts a long time (3 bottles in 6 months with daily use).</li>
            <li> My legs feel smooth and soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin soft and silky smooth.</li>
            <li> As a first time buyer I didn&#x27;t know how the product would be</li>
            <li> with all the rave reviews, i had super high hopes for the product.</li>
            <li> After just one use the amount of razor burn/rash is significantly lower - it even helped reduce the redness and soreness of my old razor burn.  </li>
            <li> Washes away cleanly and leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li> , I decided to just slather it everywhere like it was lotion and rinse it off -- my skin was super soft!  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin super soft!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted, thanks</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin super soft.</li>
            <li> Like I said, leaves my skin super soft</li>
            <li> Super soft.</li>
            <li> Anyway, this stuff makes the tuffest of facial hair shave so easily.</li>
            <li> this stuff makes my downstairs super soft and smell like roses.</li>
            <li> I will never pay the high price through Pure Romance again!</li>
            <li> Silly name, she can barely say it without giggling, but the lotion is amazing - and the price was exceptional.  </li>
            <li> Sure, the smell is a little feminine, but it leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth and helps prevent razor burn.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much at all each time you use it, hence why it lasts forever.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> When my friend and I go rafting up in the literally unnamed regions of Maine and packing the minimum is essential my Coochy Cream doubles as conditioner for our hair, works fantastic.</li>
            <li> Product as described, fast shipping</li>
            <li> Fantastic in everyway possible!</li>
            <li> stuff really works.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t realize how much product I had ordered (think hairspray can sized) until it arrived.  </li>
            <li> It rarely irritates my legs, and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My husband uses it to shave and he does not break out as much as before.</li>
            <li> My wife and I use it for those intimate areas.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than anywhere else</li>
            <li> This item works very well</li>
            <li> This coochy Creme really helps in reducing the razor burn</li>
            <li> she loves how soft her skin is, I too enjoy how soft her skin is</li>
            <li> You can definitely tell it has conditioning properties because your skin will be so soft &amp; smooth after you you use the cream!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I followed the recommendation of other reviews and bought this 3-pack.  </li>
            <li> My skin is not only smooth, but very soft as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a dream product and I will have it stocked in my home for as long as it is available</li>
            <li> My legs are still smooth 2 day after shaving and on the 3rd day, just the tiniest bit of (soft) stubble.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly with my prime shipping, but one of the caps were cracked, and the bottles have mysterious markings on them in sharpie.</li>
            <li> My wife used to sell it and got me t try and older bottle...</li>
            <li> A small amount lets your razor glide smoothly and it leaves your skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I will never buy normal shaving cream again.</li>
            <li> this will last for quite a long time :)</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t possibly live without this shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t expect for the cheap price that I&#x27;ll get 3 big bottles this should last me for a while</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t leave my legs super dry like some shaving products do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and every time I used to shave I would always get razor burn, even on my legs.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for those with sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> After first shave with this product, I still have a few bumps but definitely not as many as I normally would, plus it just smells so freaking good.</li>
            <li> Soft silky legs are just a bottle of coochy away!</li>
            <li> i bought this stuff and it helps so much in sensitive places!</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin to shaving and this is the only product that I can use consistently to stop razor burn.  </li>
            <li> I had only ever used the Pure Romance brand, so I was leery to purchase this.</li>
            <li> It made my legs so soft</li>
            <li> I used to get this at an adult store and found this company is a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this makes me legs</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and it still gave me razor bumps on my legs.</li>
            <li> I started using it just for sensitive areas and now use it for my legs as well.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin so soft, and prolongs my time in between having to shave, and DRAMATICALLY reduces the ingrown hairs I get after.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Coody Cream for years now, ever since I bought some at some adult party</li>
            <li> someone who has EXTREMELY sensitive skin in &amp;#34;that&amp;#34; area, I had issues for years with shaving my bikini line.  </li>
            <li> So the three bottles have lasted me nearly a year</li>
            <li> You only need 1-2 pumps for your whole leg</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll pay a lot more elsewhere, or at least the websites where I was looking.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;I have been using men&#x27;s shaving gel for sensitive skin for years because all the products made for women irritated my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I can keep my sensitive areas shaved and no bumps or razor burn.  </li>
            <li> On time and was especially surprised on how big the items are.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> but I am completely sold.  </li>
            <li> Keeps skin soft &amp; smoothe.</li>
            <li> Also, I feel like I have to use a LOT of it because it&#x27;s kind of thin.</li>
            <li> i have super sensitive/dry skin esp down there when i shave that i was breaking out in a rash...</li>
            <li> This works GREAT on my facial hair, as I have very sensitive skin and can not normally shave everyday or even every other day.  </li>
            <li> Definitely helps with shaving when skin is sensitive - very soft and does not cause any irritation.</li>
            <li> I use the whole 3 step system with the mist and powder to help further safeguard my sensitive skin, however they are not necessary.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin all over and this is the only product my skin can handle</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and get razor burn pretty easily (down there.)</li>
            <li> The thing that&#x27;s hard to peg is what&#x27;s in it that makes my face so smooth?</li>
            <li> Even then they are very small, not very irritating, &amp; heal quickly.</li>
            <li> I got 3 of the BIG bottles for the price of one at any adult store.</li>
            <li> Only thing is that the plumbing in my house is old</li>
            <li> Great shaving cream without irritating your delicate skin.  </li>
            <li> I tried this product once a few years ago after buying it through Pure Romance.</li>
            <li> I needed a new bottle and my other daughter lost the Coochy Cream when her sister moved.</li>
            <li> Locally, you can find these at any adult shops but they are usually way more expensive per bottle ($20 or so).  </li>
            <li> Will follow up with a review after pro long use</li>
            <li> One pump bottle goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> give an idea of how long this lasts,  </li>
            <li> The bottles were much bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> So...I helped my daughter move and noticed her bottle from last year was almost empty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products before but they still seem to leave my skin bumpy and red.</li>
            <li> I apply to dry skin and let sit for 2-3 minutes then shave in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I went to stores and found single bottles for the price of three on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> kind of disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a week since I shaved and it has just started growing in plus the new growth is not as thick either.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft and I hardly ever cut myself.</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re not as bad as before:)</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t my favorite, but it certainly isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s not as messy as traditional shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> I know this stiff is manufactured for a specific use</li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes on like lotion and with a small amount of water a little bit of this stuff will go far.</li>
            <li> and I neaver have a reaction to it like other shaving creams</li>
            <li> I will never shave with any other product again.</li>
            <li> if your shave your head (and other places...)</li>
            <li> I will NEVER use any other shaving cream after using this.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint about this product is you sometimes get bottles in which the pump doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I buy in three packs and re buy when we get down to one bottle.</li>
            <li> This shaving creme will not let you down.</li>
            <li> $35 down the drain.</li>
            <li> four stars because: When used in a shower (or tub?), the run-off makes the tile floor VERY slick, so a mat is necessary.  </li>
            <li> It works just as well for much less cost.</li>
            <li> Smoothest shave EVER, and the comments about two-day duration are almost correct; gets a little rough late on the second day, but not more than a little.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> It took me a couple of tries before I figured out to use very little product when shaving my legs, otherwise it sort of gunks up the razor and you don&#x27;t get a close shave.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little effort to get out of the blades.</li>
            <li> I have tried &#x27;other&#x27; brands and &#x27;other&#x27; products that claim to do the same thing - but they have all failed.  </li>
            <li> We have been using g this for a few years now.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> and it costs over 1/2 less and works just as well!</li>
            <li> I have very thick coarse hair and all it took was a small amount</li>
            <li> I can get it a little cheaper on here!</li>
            <li> I usually use about 6-7 pumps for each leg and 1 for underarm.  </li>
            <li> I bought a small bottle of this at a party</li>
            <li> no more razor burn or ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> This is usually 20.00 each at the store.</li>
            <li> I tried this product on my bikini line for the first time and I am highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> No more bumps and irritated skin.</li>
            <li> I usually get razor burn in the bikini area and haven&#x27;t had a problem since I&#x27;ve started using this...</li>
            <li> my hubby even used it on his face a few times until he saw that they make a shaving one!</li>
            <li> I usually always get.</li>
            <li> There really isn&#x27;t a negative thing to say about Coochy Cream.</li>
            <li> I used to use Jack Black Beard Lube, but it got so expensive that I just couldn&#x27;t justify it anymore.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my legs and underarm and the amount of rash has significantly decreased.</li>
            <li> I got bumps and redness mere hours after using this stuff.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You are crazy if you do not try it!</li>
            <li> I use to hate man scaipping because of the irritation.</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> Some shaving products gave me razor burn, horrible breakouts,  others gave me infections, made me itch, etc.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The only reason it&#x27;s not a 5 star is every bottle I&#x27;ve used breaks at the pump after 2-3 times. It&#x27;s a pain to use after that. Yet the product is amazing!</li>
            <li> $30 is a lot to spend on shave cream, however, three bottles will probably last me just about a year.  Coochy cream is absolutely worth the money.  I use it everywhere (legs, underarms, etc. :-) ) and my everything feels so smooth after I&#x27;m done shaving.  It leaves no red bumps either which is great.  I recommend it to all my friends. If you have never used it before, its completely different than shaving cream and is more of a lotion.  It tends to go on almost clear when you put it on to shave, however you will be able to see where you have and have not shaved.  I usually use about 6-7 pumps for each leg and 1 for underarm.  You don&#x27;t need much at all each time you use it, hence why it lasts forever.  Again, although its a bit pricey, you will end up saving money because you won&#x27;t be buying it as often as you do shaving cream.</li>
            <li> It took me a couple of tries before I figured out to use very little product when shaving my legs, otherwise it sort of gunks up the razor and you don&#x27;t get a close shave.  It made my legs so soft, I decided to just slather it everywhere like it was lotion and rinse it off -- my skin was super soft!  Smells really nice too</li>
            <li> I have had a rash from shaving for years on the back of my thighs, went to the Dr. and he told me Coochy and the rash is gone. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I have loved this stuff forever and always will</li>
            <li> Soft silky legs are just a bottle of coochy away!</li>
            <li> This is my wife and daughters favorite product. They love being able to shave their legs with no rash or cuts. I used to get this at an adult store and found this company is a lot cheaper. I am very impressed with their shipping unlike others I have dealt with will use from now on.</li>
            <li> Smells SO good.. Still getting shave bumps but they&#x27;re not as bad as before:)</li>
            <li> Best shaving cream out there &amp; I haven&#x27;t had a different one for over a year. Leaves my skin super soft. It does have a lotion consistency, but that doesn&#x27;t bug me. Like I said, leaves my skin super soft and I haven&#x27;t had any ingrown hairs or bumps since I began using it.</li>
            <li> Beyond my favorite! I will never buy normal shaving cream again. I have sensitive skin and this makes me legs so smooth and I neaver have a reaction to it like other shaving creams</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I have been using it for about 3 years at this point. This is a new scent which I love! I use it on my legs and underarm and the amount of rash has significantly decreased.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to all of my friends.  It&#x27;s the best shaving lotion I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Bought for three different people as a gift it was great!</li>
            <li> I never shave with anything else - legs or face! Plus I&#x27;ve recently started using as a conditioner!  Excellent results!</li>
            <li> this is the first shaving cream that i didn&#x27;t have a ton of razor bumps after!&lt;br /&gt;Side note: this will not make a crappy razor good, but a quality razor!</li>
            <li> This is amazing! I use it all over and it&#x27;s the smoothest, closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. It&#x27;s very smooth and the smell is very appealing!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin all over and this is the only product my skin can handle</li>
            <li> This is the best shave gel! Been using it for years!!! Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> So far I used it and it feels wonderful. Didn&#x27;t expect for the cheap price that I&#x27;ll get 3 big bottles this should last me for a while so the quantity is a plus. Will follow up with a review after pro long use</li>
            <li> works great leaves you very smooth much better than shaving cream.</li>
            <li> The. Best. Shave. Cream. EVER. Super soft. Great clean shave! Can&#x27;t live without. Great value!</li>
            <li> Best stuff I have ever shaved with! Makes my skin super soft! Love it!</li>
            <li> she loves how soft her skin is, I too enjoy how soft her skin is&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product would buy again !</li>
            <li> Great product, great price</li>
            <li> My husband and I swear by this stuff, I bought my first bottle years ago because it made me giggle,I&#x27;ve recommended it to anyone who would listen. I buy in three packs and re buy when we get down to one bottle.</li>
            <li> Amazing value will buy again, took a while to get it though</li>
            <li> Always use this when I shave...everywhere I shave.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I have really sensitive skin to shaving and this is the only product that I can use consistently to stop razor burn.  I still get it sometimes, but this stuff works the best of anything I have tried.  Locally, you can find these at any adult shops but they are usually way more expensive per bottle ($20 or so).  Smells great and you can also use it as lotion and hair conditioner.</li>
            <li> We have been using g this for a few years now. It is great for men amd women, faces, legs and intimate areas. No dryness or razor burn. Great on sensitive skin. Smells great too.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Reviews were accurate,  and it is a great hair conditioner.</li>
            <li> 2 of the three bottles pumps do not work.  But otherwise, product does a good job when shaving in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> i actually prefer regular shaving cream, but i&#x27;ll use the 3 bottles i purchased. with all the rave reviews, i had super high hopes for the product. kind of disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great shaving gel to have. Gives a great close clean and moisturizing shave. Able to go almost 5days until I have to shave again. I have very sensitive skin and this have become a staple in my shower.</li>
            <li> Best shave cream ever!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  The scent of the Pear Berry was also a nice change from the original product.</li>
            <li> I used to use this stuff as I bought it from a passion party.  I remember loving it but when I ran out, I never sought to find more.  Well I found this great deal (3 huge bottles for ~$30) and jumped right on it.  I use this stuff to shave everything and it just gives the closest shave.  Before ordering, I was using conditioner, which works great, but this is better.  My legs are still smooth 2 day after shaving and on the 3rd day, just the tiniest bit of (soft) stubble. The hair seems to be thinner/finer when growing back.  It&#x27;s been a month and I&#x27;m not even halfway done with 1 bottle so I know the 3 will last for quite some time.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> Coochy is the best shave creme, I use it all the time and my family loves it too.  I buy it for most of my family that have sensitive skin and it&#x27;s a smooth clean shave.</li>
            <li> I had only ever used the Pure Romance brand, so I was leery to purchase this. I will never pay the high price through Pure Romance again! You get 8 oz. more this way and it costs over 1/2 less and works just as well!</li>
            <li> Great price for three of them</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and every time I used to shave I would always get razor burn, even on my legs. This is the first product that I have been able to use that keeps my legs smooth and red bump free!</li>
            <li> Excellent shave cream</li>
            <li> Terrible. Returned it. Don&#x27;t waste your money, it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works, actually it exceeded my expectations. For you guys out there, this is sort-of a shaving cream and a medicated face balm in one. The thing that&#x27;s hard to peg is what&#x27;s in it that makes my face so smooth? Anyway, this stuff makes the tuffest of facial hair shave so easily.</li>
            <li> I love Coochy shaving cream.  Always buying this product, so figured I&#x27;d go big and buy the three pack.  Best decision I have ever made! Love it. Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly easy to shave off but it gets stuck in the razor. It takes a little effort to get out of the blades. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again. Don&#x27;t see a big difference on my skin from this to shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Always love this product and the 3 pack price is great! its almost like buy 2 get 1 free (with the prices for this product in stores)&lt;br /&gt;Shipped quickly. The only issue I had with this product was the pump not wanting to work, but the product still does what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> Love the product but the pump is funky and clogs.</li>
            <li> As a guy I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of shaving creams. This is hands down the best. You have to get over the label and just try this. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and this product is amazing! I get razor burn often because I couldn&#x27;t find a shaving cream that worked well for me. I heard about this product and I thought I would try it. Once I see a skin product I am interested in, I do a bunch of research before I buy it. Once I realized people were raving about this product, I knew I had to get it. This shaving creme will not let you down. The smell is perfect and not too strong. One bottle lasted me about four months.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and it&#x27;s soooo much cheaper than buying it at the sex shop. You get 3 for the price of one.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I got 3 of the BIG bottles for the price of one at any adult store.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and it still gave me razor bumps on my legs. I&#x27;ve used this cream before, not from amazon, and this was not as great as I remember. Does smell nice though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s do much better than shaving cream. No rash or burns and leaves my lady area smooth and tasty for my man:)</li>
            <li> I bought a small bottle of this at a party and I love it.  I rarely nick my skin with this stuff.</li>
            <li> OMG... this stuff is amazing.  I have never tried anything remotely close to this shaving cream, its amazing.  I gave one to my teenage daughters and this is what she had to say &amp;#34;This is amazing stuff created by geniuses&amp;#34; and I could not agree more.  I have very thick coarse hair and all it took was a small amount and I had a smooth sleek shave.  It&#x27;s been a week since I shaved and it has just started growing in plus the new growth is not as thick either.  You have to try it!!!!  The seller was great I had quick delivery as well; I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> this stuff makes my downstairs super soft and smell like roses. I always shave with this when I know I&#x27;m gonna get laid. My guy loves how soft I am and how great my lady parts smell and taste.</li>
            <li> After using Coochy Cream 10 years ago I&#x27;ve never gone back to traditional shave cream.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. no more razor burn or ingrown hairs. This is usually 20.00 each at the store. ok</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!! Best shaving cream.  It works soo good that my husband and I won&#x27;t use anything else. .</li>
            <li> So far so good. After first shave with this product, I still have a few bumps but definitely not as many as I normally would, plus it just smells so freaking good.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I started using it just for sensitive areas and now use it for my legs as well. I love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to layer on the lotion nearly as much because the shave lotion help s keep my legs soft and smoth.</li>
            <li> Best shave cream I&#x27;ve ever used! Leaves my skin so soft, and prolongs my time in between having to shave, and DRAMATICALLY reduces the ingrown hairs I get after.</li>
            <li> everyone has fell in love with the stuff  and cant get enough.i have many folks using it and loving the way it makes you feel.</li>
            <li> Smells good and works great! Definitely helps with shaving when skin is sensitive - very soft and does not cause any irritation.</li>
            <li> From your legs to your most sensitive parts, this stuff works great!! My daughter suggested it so I tried it. I love it. My husband uses it for shaving his face. He loves it as well.</li>
            <li> This product is the absolute best for shaving those very intimate areas. For me and my husband.</li>
            <li> Once you try this you will be hooked.</li>
            <li> Thee BEST shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used! Never any razor burns or bumps, just baby bottom smooth skin! You won&#x27;t regret buying this product.</li>
            <li> Much better than any shave cream or gel I have ever tried. Helps prevent razor burn and keeps me feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> I definitely think this product does what it says its gonna do not bumps and leaves it smooths really like it works great on legs too</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly with my prime shipping, but one of the caps were cracked, and the bottles have mysterious markings on them in sharpie. However, this purchase gets a solid 4 stars due to the fact that it arrived quickly, and it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li> What does one say? It works VERY well and is comfortable. My wife used to sell it and got me t try and older bottle... after the macho laughing passed I&#x27;m quite impressed.</li>
            <li> In the last 20 years of shaving my face, I haven&#x27;t found anything that didn&#x27;t leave a rash on my neck till now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Coody Cream for years now, ever since I bought some at some adult party one of my friends had. I haven&#x27;t used anything else since, the thought of going back to using soap to shave makes me cringe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: When my friend and I go rafting up in the literally unnamed regions of Maine and packing the minimum is essential my Coochy Cream doubles as conditioner for our hair, works fantastic.</li>
            <li> I tried this product on my bikini line for the first time and I am highly disappointed. I got bumps and redness mere hours after using this stuff. Will never use let alone buy it again. $35 down the drain. I have found regular hair conditioners that work better than this garbage. Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Great for shaving anywhere without razor burn. I&#x27;ll just leave it at that.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the greatest shaving cream but its okay. I was hoping it would work like Coochie from Pure Romance line but its not as good. If you have sensitive skin or get razor burn easily, I&#x27;d suggest avoiding this product.</li>
            <li> All you need is one squirt... and you can shave your legs and underarms.  One pump bottle goes a long way.  I have not had any shaving cuts since using this product.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff! I will never shave with any other product again. Goes on smooth, protects your skin,no matter where you shave. Washes away cleanly and leaves skin soft. I have used this for years, I always order from Amazon. Love, Love, Love!</li>
            <li> This is the best shaving cream I have ever used and I refuse to use anything else.  It makes my skin so soft and I hardly ever cut myself.</li>
            <li> Have always gotten this brand and product and I will continue to swear by it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted, thanks</li>
            <li> My wife LOVES this stuff.  Silly name, she can barely say it without giggling, but the lotion is amazing - and the price was exceptional.  This is great stuff!</li>
            <li> This shaving gel is great! I used to always get razor burn on my bikini area but I never do anymore!! This smells good and works wonders for shaving!</li>
            <li> A friend of mine had a romance party. This was one of the items. It leaves your skin so soft and bump free. I threw away all my shaving cream. I always keep this stocked. I use baby oil gel right after shaving. Huge difference!!!</li>
            <li> I started using this product years ago and now I use this instead of shaving cream for my legs. I know the name references a use for our &amp;#34;venus&amp;#34; area, but it works great in all other parts of the body!</li>
            <li> this is the best shaving product on the market..gave them out as Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> Product as described, fast shipping</li>
            <li> I have tried &#x27;other&#x27; brands and &#x27;other&#x27; products that claim to do the same thing - but they have all failed.  This will always be my &#x27;go to&#x27; choice for all of my shaving needs.  I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I know this stiff is manufactured for a specific use but I&#x27;ve found that it is a great hair conditioner. I use it on my skin street a shower. I have even used out on my dog when he has mats in his coat, he hates bring brushed and this cream makes the tangles slide right out. I probably use it more add a conditioner than I do for a shade gel.....but it&#x27;s an awesome shave gel too!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I would recommend it for anyone.</li>
            <li> still somewhat bumby and rash after still..</li>
            <li> Same product I have used for years and a great bargain at the price for the 3 pack.</li>
            <li> I tried this product once a few years ago after buying it through Pure Romance. I was hooked. Have been so happy to find it on Amazon for literally half the price.&lt;br /&gt;As someone who has EXTREMELY sensitive skin in &amp;#34;that&amp;#34; area, I had issues for years with shaving my bikini line.  Some shaving products gave me razor burn, horrible breakouts,  others gave me infections, made me itch, etc.  Coochy does none of the above.  I use this on my legs and under arms as well.  It&#x27;s the only shaving product I will ever use and if for some reason it&#x27;s ever discontinued - I&#x27;ll just become a sasquatch!&lt;br /&gt;To give an idea of how long this lasts,  I&#x27;m almost out and my last order was Sept. of last year.  So the three bottles have lasted me nearly a year - I will say that I do add water to the bottle.  I find it works just as well and it stretches my dollars.  My only complaint about this product is you sometimes get bottles in which the pump doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Product as advertised! :)</li>
            <li> I had been using Skintimate brand shave gel for years prior to trying Coochy and man, what a difference! I have extremely sensitive skin and get razor burn pretty easily (down there.) With Skintimate, I would get some sort of rash 80% of the time. Urgh. With Coochy I only get razor bumps 20% of the time! Even then they are very small, not very irritating, &amp; heal quickly. I use the whole 3 step system with the mist and powder to help further safeguard my sensitive skin, however they are not necessary. When I ordered everything, the cream got here several days faster than the others and my skin was great with just the cream! I LOVE the scent of the Pear Berry formula! It smells so yummy and makes anyone feel good about themselves. You can definitely tell it has conditioning properties because your skin will be so soft &amp; smooth after you you use the cream! The consistency makes you think you need several pumps of the product, but that is not the case. You only need 1-2 pumps for your whole leg I promise! I tried it once as a conditioner for my hair and it worked pretty well. That is not the purpose I will use it for, but it is nice to use in a pinch! It&#x27;s a dream product and I will have it stocked in my home for as long as it is available (which better be forever!)</li>
            <li> I bought this item at a local adult store and am so happy I did!!! I will never use anything else again!!!! I will definitely be stocking up with this awesome value!!!!</li>
            <li> Have used this for years. Great shaving cream!! No razor rash!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I never write reviews on anything but I felt enclined to do so for this. Coochy Cream is a good rash free cream to have because it truly is rash free. I&#x27;ve used other products before but they still seem to leave my skin bumpy and red. But Coochy Cream works wonderfully without the irritation. This is also the best deal you&#x27;ll find on this product. 3 16oz bottles for $30? You&#x27;ll pay a lot more elsewhere, or at least the websites where I was looking. There really isn&#x27;t a negative thing to say about Coochy Cream. I love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, that&#x27;s why I ordered 3 more after my first order 2 weeks ago. I can&#x27;t possibly live without this shaving cream. I would actually check a bag while going on vacation just to be able to bring this cream. I only gave 4 stars because one bottle arrived with a cracked/broken top so it doesn&#x27;t have a top anymore but thats not that big of a deal. The product needs to be packaged better for shipping</li>
            <li> Nice scent, great product!</li>
            <li> Fantastic in everyway possible! Shipping was incredibly fast! Product is amazing!</li>
            <li> I went to stores and found single bottles for the price of three on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff really works. No more bumps and irritated skin. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this stuff actually works. At first, I thought it was just glorified conditioner, but I had NO bumps afterwards! The bottles were much bigger than I expected. Well worth the price. The smell isn&#x27;t my favorite, but it certainly isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> I had purchased Cochise cream through Athena&#x27;s which was much more expensive. I was concerned when I purchased this product that it would not be the same quality, but it is!! It works just as well for much less cost. I was pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;I have been using men&#x27;s shaving gel for sensitive skin for years because all the products made for women irritated my sensitive skin. So I was really glad to find this product because it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or leave me smelling like a man. It also doesn&#x27;t leave my legs super dry like some shaving products do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I definitely still get razor burn using this. Especially on my thighs. Also, I feel like I have to use a LOT of it because it&#x27;s kind of thin. Like I&#x27;ll apply it all over my calf/shin, but by the time I&#x27;m done with one side of my leg, I have to reapply to the other side because it just kind of slides off or is washed off easily by the light spray coming from the shower. This wasn&#x27;t an issue with thicker creams.</li>
            <li> I will never shave again without it!!! I definitely recommend it to all my friends! You are crazy if you do not try it!</li>
            <li> Great shaving cream without irritating your delicate skin.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product for sensitive areas.  Smells nice, makes shaving down there a pleasant experience.  I apply to dry skin and let sit for 2-3 minutes then shave in the shower.  Super smooth skin and no irritation at all.  This is my second purchase and I am hooked.  The three bottle set is a great value and lasts a long time (3 bottles in 6 months with daily use).</li>
            <li> This stuff is liquid gold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on like lotion and with a small amount of water a little bit of this stuff will go far. No razor bumps and smells great while using the product but doesn&#x27;t leave a pear after scent that you may regret later!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3 pack consisted of 16 oz. bottles and I didn&#x27;t realize how much product I had ordered (think hairspray can sized) until it arrived.  Having never splurged on shaving cream, always limiting my price point to couple dollars, I didn&#x27;t expect to be converted and only ordered because my friend kept raving about it so I had to see what the hype was about. Now I can&#x27;t imagine ever going back! Shoot, I&#x27;m already shopping for a quality razor and have plans on ordering the tea scented version next!</li>
            <li> Really love thus stuff! Zero razor burn or bumps</li>
            <li> Love it! Won&#x27;t shave with anything else.  Pear is the best scent.</li>
            <li> I have been using Coochy for over 10 years and it has always done me right. I have very sensitive skin so if I shave with anything else, I break out and itch. The best part about buying it on Amazon is the price! I would pay $20 a bottle buying it in the store so I save a ton buying it here.</li>
            <li> excellent purxhase and speedy shipping</li>
            <li> This is the best shave cream for my legs! It rarely irritates my legs, and I have sensitive skin. My skin is not only smooth, but very soft as well. Great product, and I love I can get it a little cheaper on here!</li>
            <li> Great stuff for a better price on amazon</li>
            <li> The best shave cream on the planet!! Will never use anything else!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best deals and best shaving creams I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! My husband uses it to shave and he does not break out as much as before. Highly recommended for those with sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> love, love, love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Love it!!</li>
            <li> This works GREAT on my facial hair, as I have very sensitive skin and can not normally shave everyday or even every other day.  If you are having issues with razor burn, give this a try!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for shaving my legs and underarms for several years now. My boyfriend uses it to shave his face and loves it because it prevents ingrown hairs,no bumps. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a coochy, but I use this for my face. It smells nice and it gives me a nice, smooth shave and leaves my skin feeling soft. I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I love this shave cream and always will. I use it and my boyfriend uses it for his face. It helps reduce and even get rid of shave bumps on the face and legs. It provides a lot of moisture as well, don&#x27;t even need lotion after I shave which is nice.</li>
            <li> 2/3 bottles were cracked &amp; leaking when I got it. The cream smells good but did not work like the  Coochy from a Passion Party.</li>
            <li> Works great. Smooth shave. Way better than shave cream from department stores.</li>
            <li> Best shave cream ever! Works great!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I can keep my sensitive areas shaved and no bumps or razor burn.  I also use it as an after shave lotion.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderfull.My wife and I use it for those intimate areas.I use to hate man scaipping because of the irritation. Not anymore, and things are great in the sex department.Great deal on the three larger bottles.Much cheaper than anywhere else I could find.</li>
            <li> I have been ordering this product for years and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!!! Love the scent and the way my skin feels after I shave. Highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> Best shave cream for all of your sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> great deal considering the normal price is more than this for 1/3rd of what your getting here.  stuff works great too, really cuts down on skin iritation.</li>
            <li> this is the ONLY thing I will use to shave, it leaves no marks, bumps, irritation, I love this!! I will buy again!!</li>
            <li> I gave this 5 stars because I am a repeat buyer. Enough said? Not for Amazon. So...I helped my daughter move and noticed her bottle from last year was almost empty. I needed a new bottle and my other daughter lost the Coochy Cream when her sister moved. The 3-pack was perfect. This seemed to be the best price. It&#x27;s up to you where you use it but it works great for legs and underarms. A small amount lets your razor glide smoothly and it leaves your skin smooth and soft. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever!! Make sure to let it sit for a minute or two before shaving and you&#x27;ll love the results!</li>
            <li> Its a great product :)</li>
            <li> This product is very good because it allows for a smooth shave.  Only thing is that the plumbing in my house is old n this products clogs it sometimes.  I just had laser hair removal so my mom will be using the rest.</li>
            <li> Service was great as always. The product is AWESOME! Smells great, no rash, or bumps after shaving. My legs feel smooth and soft afterwards. I love it and at a great price.</li>
            <li> On time and was especially surprised on how big the items are.</li>
            <li> The ONLY shaving cream I use! Works wonderful on legs!  Leaves your skin soft and silky smooth. Highly recommend!!! 5+Stars!!</li>
            <li> Great item.  2nd time buying it. This item works very well, i use it everywhere and never get razor burn</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Since I tried it three years ago.... I haven&#x27;t used anything else to shave my legs!  A bottle lasts about 6-8 months so it is well worth the cost.  This three pack trio is the best deal I&#x27;ve ever found!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a Coochy, but this works well for my face.  I used to use Jack Black Beard Lube, but it got so expensive that I just couldn&#x27;t justify it anymore.  This is best alternative I&#x27;ve found.  Sure, the smell is a little feminine, but it leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth and helps prevent razor burn.  Plus, it&#x27;s not as messy as traditional shaving cream.  I would recommend this to anyone, girl or guy.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!!! Actually love them all but this is my favorite scent! I usually get razor burn in the bikini area and haven&#x27;t had a problem since I&#x27;ve started using this...also seems like I go longer between shaves</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff, however I wish it stayed on the skin better.  It likes to slide all over.  If it managed to have the same affect but be foamy, that&#x27;d be something else!  I&#x27;ll keep looking.  But if you have sensitive/razor burn-y skin like I do, this will help a lot!</li>
            <li> I buy this in bulk and use it where it was meant to be used. I prefer this over shaving cream or soap. It works well. I&#x27;ve purchased this product many times.</li>
            <li> This is magic on a tender face. Smoothest shave EVER, and the comments about two-day duration are almost correct; gets a little rough late on the second day, but not more than a little.&lt;br /&gt;Only four stars because: When used in a shower (or tub?), the run-off makes the tile floor VERY slick, so a mat is necessary.  And, the dispenser top on the bottle has to be positioned JUST RIGHT to pump out the cream.</li>
            <li> This should not be classified as &amp;#34;erotica&amp;#34;. It is the best shaving cream/gel on the market. My wife and I both have sensitive skin. We both love using this.</li>
            <li> i have super sensitive/dry skin esp down there when i shave that i was breaking out in a rash... i bought this stuff and it helps so much in sensitive places! my hubby even used it on his face a few times until he saw that they make a shaving one! it lasts FOREVER too!!!</li>
            <li> I am hooked!  I will never shave with anything else and my man won&#x27;t either!  Listen up men out there-- if your shave your head (and other places...) perfect product!  Your woman will love the smoothness of your shaved head (or....)</li>
            <li> Great deal for the amount you get. This is my favorite shaving cream for the bikini area.</li>
            <li> I will NEVER use any other shaving cream after using this.  I am so glad I followed the recommendation of other reviews and bought this 3-pack.  As a first time buyer I didn&#x27;t know how the product would be but I am completely sold.  After just one use the amount of razor burn/rash is significantly lower - it even helped reduce the redness and soreness of my old razor burn.  Without a doubt this product lived up to my expectations and I will be a long-time purchaser of this in the future.  Totally worth purchasing the 3-pack.....and since you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it this will last for quite a long time :)</li>
            <li> Delivered as advertised Thank You</li>
            <li> Love this shave cream. No razor burn, cuts or bumps. Keeps skin soft &amp; smoothe.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly.  Awesome product.  Huge bottles. Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> This coochy Creme really helps in reducing the razor burn I usually always get. Love the smell too. Repeat customer.</li>
