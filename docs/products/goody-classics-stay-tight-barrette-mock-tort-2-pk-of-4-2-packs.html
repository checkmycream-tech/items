    <ol>
            <li>Happy with purchase.</li>
            <li>so I was happy to find these.</li>
            <li>very nice, good price</li>
            <li>These are the perfect size for my fine curly hair.</li>
            <li>The 2&amp;#34;  is fine but needed the longer ones, but the 2&amp;#34; serves its purpose and am a happy camper!</li>
            <li>Great arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>Just like from the store but here at a better price.</li>
            <li>so the barrette would hold more hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t buy these if I had been able to see them out of the package before purchase.</li>
            <li>They are certainly better than no Goody barrettes.  </li>
            <li>Glad I stumbled across them.</li>
            <li>I like the good ole classic kind better than the new stuffs that the makers thought would do better.  </li>
            <li>I chose this site because it had the Goody brand of barrettes that I know will work for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>These are not the original barrettes from Goody, as is suggested when they package them as &#x27;Classics&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad to see they&#x27;re available online because they certainly don&#x27;t appear to be in any stores</li>
            <li>I sure disagree and thanks Amazon for Goody&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li>Got here quick, and undamaged.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t use them in my hair because I can barely open the clasp, let alone safely close it.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li>These are exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I had one from many years ago that I finally lost.</li>
            <li>Smaller than I&#x27;m used to, yet glad to have barrettes in the color I&#x27;m used to that goes with my hair color.</li>
            <li>I had not been able to find my regular barrettes for years</li>
            <li>Different than the originals, but work fine.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, too.</li>
            <li>I received the order much quicker than stated.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and my new barrettes do slip slightly.  </li>
            <li>Not exactly like my old ones, which had more gold coloring, but they do the job.  </li>
            <li>They are about an eighth of an inch longer and have a little more curve to them than the ones I have used for years.  </li>
            <li>Nice classical barrettes that hold the hair tightly.</li>
            <li>I have very fine thin hair, and these are the only barrettes that I have found that stays securely in place.</li>
            <li>and I have a hard time using them without breaking strands of hair, which is the main reason why so many women swear by the Goody originals.</li>
            <li>Goody classic barrettes in this size work perfect in my hair and seem impossible to find in stores!  </li>
            <li>I was delighted to see them online and in the mock tortise shell brown that is also difficult to find.</li>
            <li>the plastic tortoise shell cover is not flat but curved.</li>
            <li>These also have a curve shape; they are not flat.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> These also have a curve shape; they are not flat.  </li>
            <li> But the metal clasp is a stronger and thicker metal which means it&#x27;s harder to open and close</li>
            <li> Was down to my last couple barrettes from years ago</li>
            <li> The quality is very well made with no issues &amp; none have broken as of yet.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected quality issue.</li>
            <li> other mechanics don&#x27;t seem to work too well for me.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this product in any stores where I live and bought this other hair clips that didn&#x27;t work right and had to pull the stupid thing out of my hair without breaking my hair in the process.  </li>
            <li> I tried to find these in the stores but with no success.</li>
            <li> Aesthetically, they are a little nicer than the originals-</li>
            <li> You could also bend the clasp a little</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize they were the little 2 inch size.</li>
            <li> These are rather small, so you can&#x27;t use them for ponytails.</li>
            <li> That is impossible with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> VERY disappointed.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> very nice, good price</li>
            <li> These are the perfect size for my fine curly hair. I can clip up smaller sections and they stay put. I can&#x27;t find them locally anymore. They only seem to sell the longer ones in stores.</li>
            <li> They do hold my hair together and don&#x27;t let it slip out.</li>
            <li> Just like from the store but here at a better price. The quality is very well made with no issues &amp; none have broken as of yet.</li>
            <li> These are not the original barrettes from Goody, as is suggested when they package them as &#x27;Classics&#x27;. Aesthetically, they are a little nicer than the originals-the plastic tortoise shell cover is not flat but curved. But the metal clasp is a stronger and thicker metal which means it&#x27;s harder to open and close and I have a hard time using them without breaking strands of hair, which is the main reason why so many women swear by the Goody originals. The metal had some give, and you weren&#x27;t likely to break hair. You could also bend the clasp a little so the barrette would hold more hair. That is impossible with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t buy these if I had been able to see them out of the package before purchase. I won&#x27;t use them in my hair because I can barely open the clasp, let alone safely close it.</li>

            <li> Goody classic barrettes in this size work perfect in my hair and seem impossible to find in stores!  I was delighted to see them online and in the mock tortise shell brown that is also difficult to find. Was down to my last couple barrettes from years ago so I purchase two packages!  Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li> Just what I ordered. No problems.</li>
            <li> Great arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I wanted. I had one from many years ago that I finally lost. I tried to find these in the stores but with no success. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Smaller than I&#x27;m used to, yet glad to have barrettes in the color I&#x27;m used to that goes with my hair color. Fast shipping, too. Happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> I searched for &amp;#34;3 inch&amp;#34; barrettes and this came up.  I didn&#x27;t realize they were the little 2 inch size. VERY disappointed.  When I read the reviews, I see I am not the only one that was duped by these.</li>
            <li> Not exactly like my old ones, which had more gold coloring, but they do the job.  These also have a curve shape; they are not flat.  So they curve with your head.  Different than the originals, but work fine.</li>
            <li> Just the clips I was looking for</li>
            <li> I chose this site because it had the Goody brand of barrettes that I know will work for my fine hair.  I received the order much quicker than stated.  Would definitely order from them again.</li>
            <li> They are about an eighth of an inch longer and have a little more curve to them than the ones I have used for years.  I have very fine hair and my new barrettes do slip slightly.  They are certainly better than no Goody barrettes.  I had not been able to find my regular barrettes for years so I was happy to find these.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected quality issue. The clasps hurt my fingers when using the clip. Too pricey for what I paid</li>
            <li> These are rather small, so you can&#x27;t use them for ponytails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a handful of these barrettes what seems like 30 years... Having brown hair, the &amp;#34;faux tort&amp;#34; always appealed to me. I also appreciate the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; mechanics of them (slide the bar under the tab style)... other mechanics don&#x27;t seem to work too well for me. I&#x27;m so glad to see they&#x27;re available online because they certainly don&#x27;t appear to be in any stores anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great seller, too. Got here quick, and undamaged.</li>

            <li> I have very fine thin hair, and these are the only barrettes that I have found that stays securely in place. Glad I stumbled across them.</li>
