            <li>I started using this product 3 weeks ago, honestly I can&#x27;t say if it works or not, i might hsve to using a bit longer to see the results.</li>
            <li>Nice scent....</li>
            <li>It will probably take a while to be fully effective.</li>
            <li>It is an effective styling product.</li>

            <li>It is OK.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love the product.</li>
            <li>Smells like vitamin B, so I&#x27;m glad I also use a leave-in cream rinse too.</li>
            <li>- grateful wife :)</li>
            <li>This product is a foam, and is more gooey than the #1 product line.  </li>
            <li>I took a before pic from the top of my head in December.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s the magic pill for making hair grow, however I do think it&#x27;s helped keep the hair that I have.</li>
            <li>I would love to promote the.product....</li>
            <li>It seems to retain the hair better in the follicle than when not using</li>
            <li>Satisfied with scalp treatment.</li>
            <li>better deal then the barber shop.</li>
            <li>Works much better with a shorter haircut.</li>
            <li>Love, Love this product.</li>
            <li>Seems to help from losing more hair</li>
            <li>I use it more like mousse for styling my hair.</li>
            <li>It seems to give my hair more volume.</li>
            <li>i just love it.</li>
            <li>It doesnt help grow more hair.</li>
            <li>My husband has been using this product for many years.  </li>
            <li>He has more hair and is thicker than any of his brothers.</li>
            <li>so I tried the Nioxin Hair Booster and have noticed more hair growth using both products together.</li>
            <li>Well pleased with this item.</li>
            <li>I have used Nioxin for many years.</li>
            <li>The Nioxin scalp treatment is both functional to create an environment for a healthy scalp and stronger more thicker hair.</li>
            <li>Hair is getting thicker, meaning more hair growing.</li>
            <li>This is supposed to help most in the retention of hair and scalp health.</li>
            <li>I did grow some more hair on the crown of my head where hair is thining.</li>
            <li>and it seemed to help thicken my hair on top.</li>
            <li>Great product quickly delivered, thanks!</li>
            <li>a really good product if you loosing to much hair</li>
            <li>Although my volume hasn&#x27;t increased in leaps and bounds but the hairfall reduced and i can see significantly that each strand got stronger with more volume.</li>
            <li>The best product to add volume and texture hands down.</li>
            <li>Adds body to thinning, fine hair.</li>
            <li>My before pics showed a huge area of my scalp where my hair part was.</li>
            <li>It seems to help grow hair but also make the strands thicker, which, when discussing with niece who works at a salon where these items are sold, confirmed that is what these products do.</li>
            <li>Great product, have used it and kept my thinning hair the same ever since.</li>
            <li>happy with the overall results..</li>
            <li>I promise I am a normal person and get nothing by leaving this honest review.</li>
            <li>The shampoo/conditioner I ordered was full of water</li>
            <li>This product, used in conjunction with the shampoo and conditioner of System 2, does seem to be helping my hair be thicker--not full yet but moving in that direction</li>
            <li>I truly can&#x27;t say enough good about this product.</li>
            <li>I have a full head of hair.</li>
            <li>I  used to be really self-conscious about my thinning hair on top.  </li>
            <li>Not bad for $30.</li>
            <li>The vendor delivered the product quickly and the product was packaged well.</li>
            <li>This a great hair product and it really prevents further hair loss.</li>
            <li>Satisfied, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this product because it has been slowing down my hair loss.  </li>
            <li>Great value for Nioxin, since this size typically goes for $40</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fan of Nioxin though because they have a pretty good following.  </li>
            <li>good for dry scalp &amp; has a hair control feature...</li>
            <li>It is worth the money</li>
            <li>It was what I order it was worth the price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the one product line that has consistently solid reviews, in good numbers, pretty much everywhere you look.  </li>
            <li>I probably should have returned the products right then, but I decided to try them out.</li>
            <li>So blown away that I came right on here to post a review.</li>
            <li>It arrived right on time and no damage to the packaging.  </li>
            <li>It is watery and I have tried pumping into my hand and disbursing on head but since it is supposed to be a foam, it doesn&#x27;t go on right and ends up gummy.  </li>
            <li>Works great hair is really thick and full</li>
            <li>Like the spray version of this better, but I guess it still works he same.</li>
            <li>definitely better than seeking this product at a local store</li>
            <li>Exactly what he wanted.  </li>
            <li>Way cheaper, thanks!</li>
            <li>you use it consistently and use with the shampoo and conditioner which I do.  </li>
            <li>but it really does!  </li>
            <li>This product really helps!</li>
            <li>Will definitely order it again when I need more.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product before but first time purchasing it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Nioxin makes the most of what hair I have left on the ol&#x27; melon.</li>
            <li>, my hair thins more than it currently has.</li>
            <li>I now use just a little bit of both solutions, minimally applied, and the results are great!</li>
            <li>Good product but not sure if it does what it advertises.</li>
            <li>Gave it 2 stars only because it&#x27;s a foam and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I like the #1 best, as it spreads on the scalp instead of mixing in the hair and making it look dirty.</li>
            <li>fast shipping, as described.  </li>
            <li>This was recommended by our stylist and it really works.</li>
            <li>I truly will used it as much as I can, and of course recommend it.</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t seem to have much affect promoting hair growth, however, my existing hair seems fuller when using it.</li>
            <li>How much of the scalp treatment should I be using each time I apply it???</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper to buy this product here on Amazon versus a salon</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really know if it works.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product before and it works really well.</li>
            <li>Great for thin and thinning hair.</li>
            <li>, I can really tell a difference.  </li>
            <li>This really works for me.  </li>
            <li>Especially if you&#x27;re trying to lightly style your hair.  </li>
            <li>Nioxin works very well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see as much hair falling off.</li>
            <li>This product has been very helpful in making the hair shaft feel and look thicker.</li>
            <li>Item as described, very prompt shipping.</li>
            <li>I have used Noxin for several years now and enjoy the product.</li>
            <li>The people at Nioxin should really look into adding and subtracting some ingredients.</li>
            <li>The website is quite helpful if you look around it, and so far, the products seem to have worked pretty well for me.  </li>
            <li>Saw Palmetto and some vitamins are old hat and pretty ineffective.</li>
            <li>Tried this product - very easy to apply, no rinse, tingly, cooling scalp sensation, no strong fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I had previously used the System 1 Scalp Treatment and was satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I am now looking for another system that will leave my hair like it was before I started using this particular Nioxin System 2 scalp treatment.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>The product has good hold and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>but within a month of him continuing the scalp treatment his hairline returns to normal.</li>
            <li>However it&#x27;s somewhat expensive and I&#x27;ve been able to find compatible products at Marshalls and TJ Max  for better price than Amazon offers.</li>
            <li>Hair loss products still suck for the most part, but there have been a few improvements.</li>
            <li>I think I can honestly say that the formula does work, but hair growth is EXTREMELY slow.  </li>
            <li>I seriously am leaving it because I hope you will be convinced and give yourself the gift of more hair!</li>
            <li>As a 30 year old man who is starting to notice a thin spot in the back a 2 years ago, I did plenty of research on what solutions were offered, what worked and what didn&#x27;t, and what was the best value for my money.  </li>
            <li>Bear in mind this is not designed to regrow new hair but to strengthen the scalp which in turn nourishes existing hair...</li>
            <li>The new company changed the formula and ruined it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see new hair growing yet</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t see any new hair growth though..</li>
            <li>New hair is coming in thicker than before treatment..</li>
            <li>Whether it will cause new hair growth remains to be seen.</li>
            <li>really like the new larger size</li>
            <li>and I honestly don&#x27;t see any decrease in the amount of hair in my hairbrush every morning, nor do I see any new growth of hair in the thin spots.</li>
            <li>They still use the same old ingredients that really don&#x27;t do much in terms of helping with hair loss.</li>
            <li>I would unhesitatingly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>Once you comb through it, your hair is soft, but will still stay in place.</li>
            <li>arrived a day early, like that.</li>
            <li>This was a waste of money and it wasn&#x27;t cheap..</li>
            <li>I next tried the 3 part nioxin system and firmly believe this is producing better results than the rogain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure that I am growing any new hair, but my doctor did comment that she noticed more follicles than she had prior to using this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this is helping me to grow more hair or if it&#x27;s simply thickening the strands or if it&#x27;s drying it out so that it stays fluffier.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that buying the larger components of the system individually rather than as a package generally provides more solution for less money.</li>
            <li>However, as I have very fine and thin hair, I advise that you use a very little bit of this solution your first time and do not apply it liberally throughout your entire head as described, which I did along with the Scalp Booster, because in doing this I lost a whole comb-full of hair!  </li>
            <li>Foam makes it easy to apply a small amount for my entire head.</li>
            <li>This Nioxin scalp treatment leaves my hair stiff, sticky and in quick need of another shampoo.  </li>
            <li>She said it was a little pricey, but I figured, it is worth a shot.</li>
            <li>Have definitely seen a huge reduction of hair loss, and no more hair strands in the comb or brush.</li>
            <li>Gives thin hair more body.</li>
            <li>If you use it every shampoo (especially with Nioxin cleanser/conditioner combo) and you have any live hair follicles left, this will make your hair fuller and thicker in not a whole lot of time.</li>

            <li> This product, used in conjunction with the shampoo and conditioner of System 2, does seem to be helping my hair be thicker--not full yet but moving in that direction</li>
            <li> I truly can&#x27;t say enough good about this product.</li>
            <li> I have a full head of hair.</li>
            <li> I  used to be really self-conscious about my thinning hair on top.  </li>
            <li> Not bad for $30.</li>
            <li> The vendor delivered the product quickly and the product was packaged well.</li>
            <li> This a great hair product and it really prevents further hair loss.</li>
            <li> Satisfied, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product because it has been slowing down my hair loss.  </li>
            <li> Great value for Nioxin, since this size typically goes for $40</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Nioxin though because they have a pretty good following.  </li>
            <li> good for dry scalp &amp; has a hair control feature...</li>
            <li> It is worth the money</li>
            <li> It was what I order it was worth the price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the one product line that has consistently solid reviews, in good numbers, pretty much everywhere you look.  </li>
            <li> I probably should have returned the products right then, but I decided to try them out.</li>
            <li> So blown away that I came right on here to post a review.</li>
            <li> It arrived right on time and no damage to the packaging.  </li>
            <li> It is watery and I have tried pumping into my hand and disbursing on head but since it is supposed to be a foam, it doesn&#x27;t go on right and ends up gummy.  </li>
            <li> Works great hair is really thick and full</li>
            <li> Like the spray version of this better, but I guess it still works he same.</li>
            <li> definitely better than seeking this product at a local store</li>
            <li> Exactly what he wanted.  </li>
            <li> Way cheaper, thanks!</li>
            <li> you use it consistently and use with the shampoo and conditioner which I do.  </li>
            <li> but it really does!  </li>
            <li> This product really helps!</li>
            <li> Will definitely order it again when I need more.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product before but first time purchasing it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Nioxin makes the most of what hair I have left on the ol&#x27; melon.</li>
            <li> , my hair thins more than it currently has.</li>
            <li> I now use just a little bit of both solutions, minimally applied, and the results are great!</li>
            <li> Good product but not sure if it does what it advertises.</li>
            <li> Gave it 2 stars only because it&#x27;s a foam and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I like the #1 best, as it spreads on the scalp instead of mixing in the hair and making it look dirty.</li>
            <li> fast shipping, as described.  </li>
            <li> This was recommended by our stylist and it really works.</li>
            <li> I truly will used it as much as I can, and of course recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t seem to have much affect promoting hair growth, however, my existing hair seems fuller when using it.</li>
            <li> How much of the scalp treatment should I be using each time I apply it???</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much cheaper to buy this product here on Amazon versus a salon</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really know if it works.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product before and it works really well.</li>
            <li> Great for thin and thinning hair.</li>
            <li> , I can really tell a difference.  </li>
            <li> This really works for me.  </li>
            <li> Especially if you&#x27;re trying to lightly style your hair.  </li>
            <li> Nioxin works very well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see as much hair falling off.</li>
            <li> This product has been very helpful in making the hair shaft feel and look thicker.</li>
            <li> Item as described, very prompt shipping.</li>
            <li> I have used Noxin for several years now and enjoy the product.</li>
            <li> The people at Nioxin should really look into adding and subtracting some ingredients.</li>
            <li> The website is quite helpful if you look around it, and so far, the products seem to have worked pretty well for me.  </li>
            <li> Saw Palmetto and some vitamins are old hat and pretty ineffective.</li>
            <li> Tried this product - very easy to apply, no rinse, tingly, cooling scalp sensation, no strong fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I had previously used the System 1 Scalp Treatment and was satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I am now looking for another system that will leave my hair like it was before I started using this particular Nioxin System 2 scalp treatment.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> The product has good hold and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but within a month of him continuing the scalp treatment his hairline returns to normal.</li>
            <li> However it&#x27;s somewhat expensive and I&#x27;ve been able to find compatible products at Marshalls and TJ Max  for better price than Amazon offers.</li>
            <li> Hair loss products still suck for the most part, but there have been a few improvements.</li>
            <li> I think I can honestly say that the formula does work, but hair growth is EXTREMELY slow.  </li>
            <li> I seriously am leaving it because I hope you will be convinced and give yourself the gift of more hair!</li>
            <li> As a 30 year old man who is starting to notice a thin spot in the back a 2 years ago, I did plenty of research on what solutions were offered, what worked and what didn&#x27;t, and what was the best value for my money.  </li>
            <li> Bear in mind this is not designed to regrow new hair but to strengthen the scalp which in turn nourishes existing hair...</li>
            <li> The new company changed the formula and ruined it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see new hair growing yet</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see any new hair growth though..</li>
            <li> New hair is coming in thicker than before treatment..</li>
            <li> Whether it will cause new hair growth remains to be seen.</li>
            <li> really like the new larger size</li>
            <li> and I honestly don&#x27;t see any decrease in the amount of hair in my hairbrush every morning, nor do I see any new growth of hair in the thin spots.</li>
            <li> They still use the same old ingredients that really don&#x27;t do much in terms of helping with hair loss.</li>
            <li> I would unhesitatingly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Once you comb through it, your hair is soft, but will still stay in place.</li>
            <li> arrived a day early, like that.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money and it wasn&#x27;t cheap..</li>
            <li> I next tried the 3 part nioxin system and firmly believe this is producing better results than the rogain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that I am growing any new hair, but my doctor did comment that she noticed more follicles than she had prior to using this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is helping me to grow more hair or if it&#x27;s simply thickening the strands or if it&#x27;s drying it out so that it stays fluffier.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that buying the larger components of the system individually rather than as a package generally provides more solution for less money.</li>
            <li> However, as I have very fine and thin hair, I advise that you use a very little bit of this solution your first time and do not apply it liberally throughout your entire head as described, which I did along with the Scalp Booster, because in doing this I lost a whole comb-full of hair!  </li>
            <li> Foam makes it easy to apply a small amount for my entire head.</li>
            <li> This Nioxin scalp treatment leaves my hair stiff, sticky and in quick need of another shampoo.  </li>
            <li> She said it was a little pricey, but I figured, it is worth a shot.</li>
            <li> Have definitely seen a huge reduction of hair loss, and no more hair strands in the comb or brush.</li>
            <li> Gives thin hair more body.</li>
            <li> If you use it every shampoo (especially with Nioxin cleanser/conditioner combo) and you have any live hair follicles left, this will make your hair fuller and thicker in not a whole lot of time.</li>
            <li> My husband had noticeably thinning hair right on the crown of his head but since using this product, it has improved to the point where I can hardly tell the thinning area from the rest of his head.  </li>
            <li> In my last purchase the product was very watery and not the texture it usually is.</li>
            <li> I mean, I guess it works pretty well at keeping the loose hairs under control, but it has done nothing in a year&#x27;s time to grow back, thicken, appear to thicken, or protect my hair.</li>
            <li> I was using this product for a long time with no issues.</li>
            <li> Long term effects are yet to be seen.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for almost 2 months and can see a lessening of hair loss as well as small indications of new hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , but it makesy hair extremely dry.</li>
            <li> and I see no new hair.</li>
            <li> Ever since chemotherapy, my hair has not returned to its original thickness and is now thin and limp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m don&#x27;t loose that much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They claim to be cutting edge and still it&#x27;s the same old same old in ingredients.</li>
            <li> It make your hair fuller, however, it will not grow new hair, at least from my results that I have seen.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this product will ever help you grow your hair back, but it does give it the appearance of being slightly fuller.</li>
            <li> My order processed through Amazon would not foam properly, seemed too watery and even slid down my face!</li>
            <li> I tried the rogain foams for a year or so, with not much noticeable impact.  </li>
            <li> product recieved as expected.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t finished the products yet this round, but used it once before 10-15 years back</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the other 2 products--shampoo and conditioner, but the product didn&#x27;t seem to work as well until I use all 3.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t done a lot of experimentation with other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed if I change to almost any other product</li>
            <li> Content has changed since my last order, not sure I will like it as well.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that there were very limited directions regarding the use of these 3 products together.</li>
            <li> 3-part system would last approximately 4-6 weeks with daily usage.  </li>
            <li> This product just seems to be a watered down version compared to the smaller ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since late last year and have seen an improvement in the amount of hair lost in the shower.</li>
            <li> I am 51 years old &amp; my hair has started to thin.</li>
            <li> This industry is full of scams and false advertising, so buying products can be frustrating.  </li>
            <li> I am using all of the products, not just the shampoo and conditioner, which was a serious chunk of change given that I&#x27;m not seeing any overall improvement.  </li>
            <li> but it helps to increase the diameter of ur hair stand and less hairfall...which helps to increase volume.</li>
            <li> its little oily though and weighs down my hair</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for couple of years now, and it thickens the hair and reduces the &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34; a little.  </li>
            <li> I only used this once as it made my hair very dry, brittle, tangled and difficult to comb.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money/</li>
            <li> item leaked during shipment and about a quarter of the bottle was wasted</li>
            <li> First terrible experience with this product in nearly a decade.</li>
            <li> I was losing a lot of hair and could see falling hair everyday but ever since I started using this no more hair loss.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair due to being anemic for a long time.  </li>
            <li> It is really hard to do your hair without it feeling heavy and unclean.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about whether or not it would actually work</li>
            <li> At least I am not loosing hair as I used to.</li>
            <li> it was slow going</li>
            <li> Sadly, I have used all 3 products (Shampoo, Conditioner, &amp; Treatment) as prescribed and with fidelity it a little over 3 months</li>
            <li> No good anymore.</li>
            <li> It is very expensive though, so luckily not much is needed per use.</li>
            <li> we have this to help with our thinning hair problems, or for those that already have thin hair.  </li>
            <li> Now, I have a rather thin scalp line part and all I see it hair, no underlining scalp.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this product to me when my hair started to thin.  </li>
            <li> I gave it three stars because I do feel that my hair is thicker (though this may just be a placebo effect), but overall, I am disappointed in this expensive line of products.</li>
            <li> The addition of sunscreens was a bad idea, they make your hair sticky and weighed down.</li>
            <li> it seems like this product is fake.</li>
            <li> This is a product that my husband has been using for years and he is convinced that it, along with the other products in the Nioxin System 2, helps retard hair loss.</li>
            <li> (Delivery was during cold weather and we were not home when it arrived.)  </li>
            <li> It is not too bad.</li>
            <li> This stuff is expensive!!</li>
            <li> I believe it does retard hair loss over time.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this purchase.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Stripped all the oils from hair and my hair came out. I used it for over 2 months. I should have spoke to my hairstylist before using this product. It&#x27;s not for everyone or all hair type. My hair did not get thicker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stopped using this coz it didn&#x27;t do anything for me plus it made my hair fall out</li>
            <li> After one year of use, I didn&#x27;t notice any change</li>
            <li> It is OK. It is not too bad.</li>
            <li> Like the spray version of this better, but I guess it still works he same.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this purchase. I use this product which I purchased in my hair salon. My order processed through Amazon would not foam properly, seemed too watery and even slid down my face!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product along with System 1 and I must say I am very impressed with the transformation I have experienced on both my scalp and texture of existing hair... I can actually feel thicker hair. Bear in mind this is not designed to regrow new hair but to strengthen the scalp which in turn nourishes existing hair...it&#x27;s odorless and non-greasy so one needn&#x27;t be concerned about that if applied during the day. I would unhesitatingly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great product.  thank goodness we have this to help with our thinning hair problems, or for those that already have thin hair.  Absolutely love the product.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re buying this because your hair is thinning, read all the reviews you can find and decide from there.</li>
            <li> Used this product for almost a year. Did not see any definitive results!</li>
            <li> Definitely makes my hair thicker.  I now have my daughter using it.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Great item for damaged scalp!</li>
            <li> As advertised. Been using this for several weeks and it seems to be giving results.</li>
            <li> really like the new larger size</li>
            <li> definitely better than seeking this product at a local store</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the other 2 products--shampoo and conditioner, but the product didn&#x27;t seem to work as well until I use all 3. This one is the key, I think. Smells like vitamin B, so I&#x27;m glad I also use a leave-in cream rinse too.</li>
            <li> GREAT deal on this product! This is a big bottle for only $20! Aside from the great price this product has helped my husband keep a full head of hair for over 10 years! I think the scalp treatment is KEY. The shampoo and conditioner must be used too but if you skip the scalp treatment the results will not be as good. When my husband runs out of tr scalp treatment we both always notice his hairline starting to recede- but within a month of him continuing the scalp treatment his hairline returns to normal. His brothers have all lost their hair and he would have too had not been for Nixon! - grateful wife :)</li>
            <li> Exactly what he wanted.  Larger than anything I can get here.  Cost is perfect!  Will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> Nothing.  Still waiting for growth</li>
            <li> This industry is full of scams and false advertising, so buying products can be frustrating.  I&#x27;m a fan of Nioxin though because they have a pretty good following.  It&#x27;s the one product line that has consistently solid reviews, in good numbers, pretty much everywhere you look.  The website is quite helpful if you look around it, and so far, the products seem to have worked pretty well for me.  I have seen an increase in thickness of my hair in the 6 months or so that I have used this product (along with the rest of system 2 - I would&#x27;t recommend just using this without the rest of the paired products).</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product. He says it has made a big difference in the thickness of his hair.</li>
            <li> Great product quickly delivered, thanks!</li>
            <li> Is a great product for thinning hair. I use the Shampoo, Conditioner and Treatment</li>
            <li> This product is a foam, and is more gooey than the #1 product line.  It leaves product build up on my hair.  I like the #1 best, as it spreads on the scalp instead of mixing in the hair and making it look dirty.</li>
            <li> I like this product but am concerned that it was likely frozen during delivery. (Delivery was during cold weather and we were not home when it arrived.)  It does not foam like the same product I purchased in a sample kit prior to ordering this larger size.  The product still seems to work, however.</li>
            <li> This stuff is expensive!! Glad I bought it on AMAZON!!! Way cheaper, thanks!</li>
            <li> I ordered the Nioxin System 2 Scalp Treatment (200 MI), but what I received was the Nioxin 2 Hair System Kit</li>
            <li> As a 30 year old man who is starting to notice a thin spot in the back a 2 years ago, I did plenty of research on what solutions were offered, what worked and what didn&#x27;t, and what was the best value for my money.  I tried the rogain foams for a year or so, with not much noticeable impact.  I next tried the 3 part nioxin system and firmly believe this is producing better results than the rogain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 3-part system would last approximately 4-6 weeks with daily usage.  I&#x27;ve found that buying the larger components of the system individually rather than as a package generally provides more solution for less money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and this is the only bottle that made my hair crispy like there&#x27;s hairspray in it. The shampoo/conditioner I ordered was full of water so I could imagine there&#x27;s water in this too. First terrible experience with this product in nearly a decade.</li>
            <li> I am 51 years old &amp; my hair has started to thin. I&#x27;ve used this product for a month and have seen a definite change in my hair. My hair feels thicker and I have regained some of the volume in my hair!!!</li>
            <li> For me, the jury is still out regarding the Nioxin line of hair products. Somewhere, somehow, I got the impression that these products actually stimulated hair growth. But when you read the information on the products themselves, they merely state that the Nioxin line simply makes the hair shaft feel thicker and fuller, thereby giving the impression of more hair. I probably should have returned the products right then, but I decided to try them out. It&#x27;s been about three months and I honestly don&#x27;t see any decrease in the amount of hair in my hairbrush every morning, nor do I see any new growth of hair in the thin spots. I am using all of the products, not just the shampoo and conditioner, which was a serious chunk of change given that I&#x27;m not seeing any overall improvement.  I gave it three stars because I do feel that my hair is thicker (though this may just be a placebo effect), but overall, I am disappointed in this expensive line of products.</li>
            <li> I have used the nioxin system for over 10 years.  I didn&#x27;t have enough scalp treatment left with the cleanser and scalp treatment. kit I purchased so I ordered the treatment.  This Nioxin scalp treatment leaves my hair stiff, sticky and in quick need of another shampoo.  I am presuming it is either out of date or a substitute for the Nioxin treatment I have always used.  I am now looking for another system that will leave my hair like it was before I started using this particular Nioxin System 2 scalp treatment.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years!  The price was 1/3 of what I have been paying!</li>
            <li> This product, used in conjunction with the shampoo and conditioner of System 2, does seem to be helping my hair be thicker--not full yet but moving in that direction</li>
            <li> If I can figure out how to post before and after pics, I will. My hair stylist sister-in-law recommended this product when I told her my hair has been thinning. She said it was a little pricey, but I figured, it is worth a shot. I took a before pic from the top of my head in December. Today, (been using daily with Nioxin system 2 cleanser &amp; scalp therapy for four months) I took another picture and I was blown away! So blown away that I came right on here to post a review. It is worth the money and I think I will buy this product for life!!! My before pics showed a huge area of my scalp where my hair part was. Now, I have a rather thin scalp line part and all I see it hair, no underlining scalp. I truly can&#x27;t say enough good about this product. If I didn&#x27;t see the pics myself, I wouldn&#x27;t have believed it since it has been so gradual. If you have thinning hair at all, buy Nioxin. Then, take pics like I did because you will be amazed. I promise I am a normal person and get nothing by leaving this honest review. I seriously am leaving it because I hope you will be convinced and give yourself the gift of more hair!</li>
            <li> I have been using Nioxin for twenty-two years! My hair was fragile. I couldn&#x27;t cut my bangs because they did not grow! I have a full head of hair. The product is great. But you have to use it constantly or it won&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> fast shipping, as described.  and this stuff works for me...I was told you have to  you use it consistently and use with the shampoo and conditioner which I do.  I  used to be really self-conscious about my thinning hair on top.  I have used the items for about 14 months and I don&#x27;t think about the thinning anymore.  It seems to help grow hair but also make the strands thicker, which, when discussing with niece who works at a salon where these items are sold, confirmed that is what these products do.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband. This was recommended by our stylist and it really works. He now has hair growing back.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s the magic pill for making hair grow, however I do think it&#x27;s helped keep the hair that I have. I have been using the product for 10 years.</li>
            <li> Great product, shipped quickly at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> I used it before, and it truly make my hair looks thicker... I truly will used it as much as I can, and of course recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin for almost 15 years!!!!!,it doesnt regrow hair,but thickens your,and stops hair loss,its great!!!!! I would love to promote the.product....</li>
            <li> I started using this product 3 weeks ago, honestly I can&#x27;t say if it works or not, i might hsve to using a bit longer to see the results., but it makesy hair extremely dry.</li>
            <li> Seems to work. I have a seemingly good reaction from using the step 3. The shampoo and conditioner are another story though</li>
            <li> it seems like this product is fake. I was using this product for a long time with no issues. when I start this one from this company, I started seeing hair fall rapidly. I stopped using it which I bought from this company.</li>
            <li> Leaves a straw-like texture because of the foam consistency. I now use the System 2 Cleanser and Conditioner, System 1 Scalp Treatment and Diamax product</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t done a lot of experimentation with other products. This product doesn&#x27;t seem to have much affect promoting hair growth, however, my existing hair seems fuller when using it. It seems to retain the hair better in the follicle than when not using</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It thickened my hair</li>
            <li> I have been encouraged with the effectiveness of Nioxin  products. I have been using it for almost 2 months and can see a lessening of hair loss as well as small indications of new hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that there were very limited directions regarding the use of these 3 products together. How often to wash hair? How much of the scalp treatment should I be using each time I apply it???</li>
            <li> I purchased this at the advice of my hairstylist.  I have very thin hair due to being anemic for a long time.  I have tried all sorts of different things to try and regrow my hair and nothing works.  Since I started using this I have noticed that my hair has definitely FELT thicker.  I&#x27;m not sure that I am growing any new hair, but my doctor did comment that she noticed more follicles than she had prior to using this.  I&#x27;ve re-ordered numerous times and I will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product because it has been slowing down my hair loss.  I&#x27;ve been using this product since late last year and have seen an improvement in the amount of hair lost in the shower.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually has UV control for the hair!</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this product for almost 2 years now.  I was skeptical about whether or not it would actually work but it really does!  It&#x27;s not a miracle worker and it doesn&#x27;t regrow the hair but it does make the hair thicker which gives the pretense of regrowth.  My husband had noticeably thinning hair right on the crown of his head but since using this product, it has improved to the point where I can hardly tell the thinning area from the rest of his head.  It&#x27;s much cheaper to buy this product here on Amazon versus a salon so I definitely recommend this.  He uses this in conjunction with the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Great value for Nioxin, since this size typically goes for $40+.  I think I can honestly say that the formula does work, but hair growth is EXTREMELY slow.  I&#x27;ve been using the stuff 1 time per day for over a year now, and I can see some development, but it&#x27;s marginal at best.  However, my hair does seem fuller, plus this stuff acts as a sunscreen and a gel.  Not bad for $30.</li>
            <li> This product really helps!</li>
            <li> He seems to think this works but he is still bald.</li>
            <li> Good product. Helps scalp feel a lot healthier. Product does what is is supposed to do. Satisfied with scalp treatment.</li>
            <li> Great product, have used it and kept my thinning hair the same ever since. I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Works great hair is really thick and full</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really know if it works.  Nice scent....</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this product to me when my hair started to thin.  It has helped to stop the thinning while giving my hair body.  I use it instead of mouse.  Does not have a medicinal odor.</li>
            <li> better deal then the barber shop.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and it works really well.</li>
            <li> Works much better with a shorter haircut. I only apply this with damp hair after showering. I find it necessary to comb my hair after it dries to avoid the &#x27;crunchy&#x27; effect. Once you comb through it, your hair is soft, but will still stay in place. Foam makes it easy to apply a small amount for my entire head. I prefer using this over the system 1 liquid.</li>
            <li> product recieved as expected.</li>
            <li> Great for thin and thinning hair. Makes your scalp feels cleaner and feels like there is no shampoo residues left on your scalp.</li>
            <li> This is a product that my husband has been using for years and he is convinced that it, along with the other products in the Nioxin System 2, helps retard hair loss.</li>
            <li> The scalp treatment seems to be helping my thinning hair condition somewhat.  I plan to keep using it to see if there is an improvement over time.  It will probably take a while to be fully effective.</li>
            <li> It was what I order it was worth the price</li>
            <li> Have been using Nioxin products for years. I believe it does retard hair loss over time.</li>
            <li> always like nioxin they works for money</li>
            <li> I have used this for several years in the summer. I like the SPF protection when I ride in my convertible. The product has good hold and a little goes a long way. It is very expensive though, so luckily not much is needed per use.</li>
            <li> Love, Love this product. It arrived right on time and no damage to the packaging.  Will definitely order it again when I need more.  Great hair product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple of years now.  My hair has gotten thicker.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not my imagination, I can really tell a difference.  I will keep using this product.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the product.</li>
            <li> Good product but not sure if it does what it advertises.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband. He was super happy!! He has been using this for several months and says it&#x27;s working. It was unavailable in our town so we tried Amazon and of course were very pleased to find it online for a good price.</li>
            <li> Used this for years and recommend it.</li>
            <li> Seems to help from losing more hair</li>
            <li> MY HUSBANDS HAIR HAS BEEN LOOKING THICKER EVER SINCE HE STARTED USING NIOXIN. HE USES ALL THREE PRODUCTS, SHAMPOO, CREME RINSE AND SCALP TREATMENT.  IT&#x27;S A GREAT COMBINATION.</li>
            <li> I use it more like mousse for styling my hair. It seems to give my hair more volume.</li>
            <li> It is a good product!!!</li>
            <li> i just love it. Although my volume hasn&#x27;t increased in leaps and bounds but the hairfall reduced and i can see significantly that each strand got stronger with more volume. It doesnt help grow more hair. but it helps to increase the diameter of ur hair stand and less hairfall...which helps to increase volume. its little oily though and weighs down my hair but i m still happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great product and travel size</li>
            <li> Good product for thinning hair.  I have been using this product for couple of years now, and it thickens the hair and reduces the &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34; a little.  The vendor delivered the product quickly and the product was packaged well.</li>
            <li> Use it all the time, works great</li>
            <li> I mean, I guess it works pretty well at keeping the loose hairs under control, but it has done nothing in a year&#x27;s time to grow back, thicken, appear to thicken, or protect my hair.</li>
            <li> arrived a day early, like that.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this product for many years.  This is the best price we have found,.  He has more hair and is thicker than any of his brothers.</li>
            <li> This really works for me.  Especially if you&#x27;re trying to lightly style your hair.  I don&#x27;t know if the &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; is doing anything, but it definately adds a volumizing look.</li>
            <li> Nioxin works very well. It make your hair fuller, however, it will not grow new hair, at least from my results that I have seen. I have used this product for over 5 years.</li>
            <li> I like this product, and it works as described.  However, as I have very fine and thin hair, I advise that you use a very little bit of this solution your first time and do not apply it liberally throughout your entire head as described, which I did along with the Scalp Booster, because in doing this I lost a whole comb-full of hair!  I now use just a little bit of both solutions, minimally applied, and the results are great!</li>
            <li> No good anymore. The new company changed the formula and ruined it.  You will find similar posts all over the net. Don&#x27;t waste your money/</li>
            <li> Sadly, I have used all 3 products (Shampoo, Conditioner, &amp; Treatment) as prescribed and with fidelity it a little over 3 months and I see no new hair. The only reason I give this product 3 stars is because it does help in making my hair stronger. I don&#x27;t see as much hair falling off. I will keep using it just because I&#x27;m hopeful...</li>
            <li> Product seems like is working.  At least I am not loosing hair as I used to. I don&#x27;t see new hair growing yet but I expect to happen soon.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be helping with the hair loss. Long term effects are yet to be seen. Hope it continues to help.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product about a year it was slow going so I tried the Nioxin Hair Booster and have noticed more hair growth using both products together.</li>
            <li> I am a breast cancer survivor. Ever since chemotherapy, my hair has not returned to its original thickness and is now thin and limp. This product has been very helpful in making the hair shaft feel and look thicker. Great product!</li>
            <li> I have used this product before but first time purchasing it on Amazon.  Both containers do not put out a foam as they should.  It is watery and I have tried pumping into my hand and disbursing on head but since it is supposed to be a foam, it doesn&#x27;t go on right and ends up gummy.  I am going to have to throw away both bottles.  I won&#x27;t be buying from this seller again</li>
            <li> I have used this product successfully for about four years. In my last purchase the product was very watery and not the texture it usually is.I do not know why but it is different. If you use this product open immediately and check to see if it is watery. I will not ever wait to open a product again.</li>
            <li> Well pleased with this item. Great product.</li>
            <li> I dislike this.  It is really hard to do your hair without it feeling heavy and unclean.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I thought it was. I thought I was ordering the scalp treatment...this is sunscreen, so it was a waste, and my mistake as they look so much alike.</li>
            <li> Item as described, very prompt shipping.</li>
            <li> I have used Noxin for several years now and enjoy the product. However it&#x27;s somewhat expensive and I&#x27;ve been able to find compatible products at Marshalls and TJ Max  for better price than Amazon offers.</li>
            <li> This does make my hair feel thicker.. Been using for about 2 close to 3 months. Don&#x27;t see any new hair growth though.. I would recommend it. It is like a mousse so remember it will make your hair feel that way when blow drying it...</li>
            <li> Nioxin makes the most of what hair I have left on the ol&#x27; melon. Would not use anything else.</li>
            <li> I only used this once as it made my hair very dry, brittle, tangled and difficult to comb. I had previously used the System 1 Scalp Treatment and was satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> acts as a styling agent-does a good job</li>
            <li> good for dry scalp &amp; has a hair control feature...</li>
            <li> I have used Nioxin for many years. Had I not, I would have three or four hairs on my head.</li>
            <li> Hair thickness has definitely improved after use.  Will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for years. If you use it every shampoo (especially with Nioxin cleanser/conditioner combo) and you have any live hair follicles left, this will make your hair fuller and thicker in not a whole lot of time.</li>
            <li> The number 2 doesn&#x27;t work well on my hair even though I use the number 2 conditioner and shampoo.  It is sticky and drying.  So I use the number 1 scalp treatment.  This was a waste of money and it wasn&#x27;t cheap..</li>
            <li> Works great with the shampoo and conditioner......&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the overall results..</li>
            <li> This was a good product 10 yrs ago. They still use the same old ingredients that really don&#x27;t do much in terms of helping with hair loss. The addition of sunscreens was a bad idea, they make your hair sticky and weighed down. Gave it 2 stars only because it&#x27;s a foam and easy to apply. The people at Nioxin should really look into adding and subtracting some ingredients. Hair loss products still suck for the most part, but there have been a few improvements. Saw Palmetto and some vitamins are old hat and pretty ineffective. They claim to be cutting edge and still it&#x27;s the same old same old in ingredients. Switch it up!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only hair styling product I&#x27;ll use anymore. I&#x27;ve noticed if I change to almost any other product, my hair thins more than it currently has.</li>
            <li> This product just seems to be a watered down version compared to the smaller ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> One thing I wish Nioxin has in its ingredient, 10% Minoxidil. ( FDA approved to have some hair growth potential). It will definitely increase its market share in the billion-dollar hair growth industry. Nioxin + minoxidil &#x3D; 5 stars satisfaction  vs Nioxin only&#x3D; 4 star satisfactions</li>
            <li> My longtime hairdresser noticed some thinning hair around temples and forehead. Tried this product - very easy to apply, no rinse, tingly, cooling scalp sensation, no strong fragrance.  Hair looks fuller, does not affect hair tint.  Use it two to three times weekly.  Satisfied, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Content has changed since my last order, not sure I will like it as well.</li>
            <li> The Nioxin scalp treatment is both functional to create an environment for a healthy scalp and stronger more thicker hair. Will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> The best product to add volume and texture hands down. Wouldn&#x27;t leave the house without it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several months and is doing the job of thining hair.  New hair is coming in thicker than before treatment..</li>
            <li> The hairdresser recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Help me a lot, my hair I&#x27;m don&#x27;t loose that much.&lt;br /&gt;Is a really good product if you loosing to much hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is helping me to grow more hair or if it&#x27;s simply thickening the strands or if it&#x27;s drying it out so that it stays fluffier.  Whatever, I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year and plan on continuing</li>
            <li> This stuff actually is working! Hair is getting thicker, meaning more hair growing.</li>
            <li> Gives thin hair more body.</li>
            <li> item leaked during shipment and about a quarter of the bottle was wasted</li>
            <li> Completes the third part of the shampoo , conditioner cycle. This is supposed to help most in the retention of hair and scalp health. I am 63 and I am not loosing hair like I was before I used all three products together. I did grow some more hair on the crown of my head where hair is thining. My  barber told me that after 8 wks of use. I don&#x27;t count them myself. I had been using organic products before with tea tree oil in them. I wasn&#x27;t loosing a lot of hair with them either. This product line works differently together.</li>
            <li> Adds body to thinning, fine hair. It is an effective styling product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this product will ever help you grow your hair back, but it does give it the appearance of being slightly fuller.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for my hair</li>
            <li> Have definitely seen a huge reduction of hair loss, and no more hair strands in the comb or brush.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t finished the products yet this round, but used it once before 10-15 years back and it seemed to help thicken my hair on top.</li>
            <li> This a great hair product and it really prevents further hair loss. I was losing a lot of hair and could see falling hair everyday but ever since I started using this no more hair loss. Whether it will cause new hair growth remains to be seen.</li>
