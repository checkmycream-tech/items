            <li>This is ok.  </li>
            <li>If you love any and all Benefit products like I do, then you will love this one as well.</li>
            <li>chalk would probably work better.  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this primer.</li>
            <li>Have used many.</li>
            <li>This primer is absolutely amazing, it helps so much in keeping my make-up on and is very easy to use although the shipping takes a while.</li>
            <li>Easy application</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many other primers and this is the best by far!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure it broke me out.</li>
            <li>But overall this is a good product.</li>
            <li>Really nice-very silky, smooth foundation goes on easily and stays on</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super exciting.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think its worth the $40 i paid for this item via prime.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product, it really does help my makeup to last for 15+ hours.</li>
            <li>but I really have to check my foundation after I apply it after the stick other wise my foundation gets smudgy and can look unblended.</li>
            <li>It has a light beige tint to it in the stick, but it goes on clear.  </li>
            <li>and she has very oily skin</li>
            <li>and nothing really works well.  </li>
            <li>this product is dry and does not go smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and will be continuing to reorder it time and time again.</li>
            <li>I will say that it did get my makeup to last longer, but when your face is a cakey, clownish mess, that is no longer such a great advantage.  </li>
            <li>Trying something new.</li>
            <li>I tried this product for over a week, following the instructions exactly, and - no.  </li>
            <li>Not sure this is authentic benefit.</li>
            <li>bought this product for the first time at my local Ulta store.  </li>
            <li>she says she doesnt really need to touch up her shine in the middle of the day anymore!!  </li>
            <li>Worth every cent spent!</li>
            <li>Emphasized fine lines and did very little to control shine or disguise pores.  </li>
            <li>I have normal skin not oily nor dry, I was looking for a primer just so my makeup could last longer and let me just say this is not it.</li>
            <li>I am a 44 year old female who has dry skin, but sweats a lot.  </li>

            <li> Excellent product. Worth every cent spent!</li>
            <li> This is ok.  Not the miracle some reviewers make it out to be.  Once applied it makes the skin a bit tacky and does mix well with the BB cream I use (skin 79 pink), but looks a bit cakey by the end of the day.  I feel like it changes the tone of my bb cream.  I don&#x27;t think its worth the $40 i paid for this item via prime.</li>

            <li> The product itself is amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many other primers and this is the best by far! I&#x27;ve worn makeup on my eyelids and face for the entire day and had no smudges, fading, or creases! This is what I&#x27;ve been looking for! I highly recommend this product and will be continuing to reorder it time and time again.</li>
            <li> This primer is absolutely amazing, it helps so much in keeping my make-up on and is very easy to use although the shipping takes a while.</li>
            <li> Easy application but I really have to check my foundation after I apply it after the stick other wise my foundation gets smudgy and can look unblended. But it does help my foundation last longer.</li>

            <li> üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëçwonderful on myface</li>
            <li> Really nice-very silky, smooth foundation goes on easily and stays on</li>
            <li> My Daughter SWEARS by this stuff it does the job and she has very oily skin well compared to mine and it keeps her makeup on all day she says she doesnt really need to touch up her shine in the middle of the day anymore!!  Great for oily skin with a tendency to lose product that way as the day goes on..DEF. Does what its supposed to do!!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is terrible. Doesn&#x27;t last makes me oily and I&#x27;m pretty sure it broke me out. Useless. Cute packaging but just useless</li>
            <li> Great stuff a definite buy</li>
            <li> When you put it on, if you&#x27;re using liquid make up you have to wait about ten minutes before you put on your make up or else it smears and doesn&#x27;t go on evenly. But overall this is a good product.</li>
            <li> Not sure this is authentic benefit.</li>
            <li> I am a 44 year old female who has dry skin, but sweats a lot.  As a result, my makeup basically melts off of my face within a few hours.  I have tried all of the other primers, setting powder, long lasting foundation, etc. etc. etc. and nothing really works well.  Until I found this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product for the first time at my local Ulta store.  It is a stick that is about 1 1/2 inches wide.  You simply rub this stick on your face (I even use it on my eyes with no issues at all!) and then rub it into your face.  It has a light beige tint to it in the stick, but it goes on clear.  Then, you apply your makeup as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe how well this works.  I mean, I can put this on under my makeup at 7AM and my makeup (including my eyeliner and blush which melts off within a few hours, typically) is still there and looking like I just applied it!  And, it doesn&#x27;t have any greasy feel at all.  I can&#x27;t even feel that I am wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this product.  I use this every single day and I expect for this tube to last me a year - you use so little of it.  I already ordered another one as I never, ever want to be without this product again.</li>
            <li> I have normal skin not oily nor dry, I was looking for a primer just so my makeup could last longer and let me just say this is not it. It leaves my face dry and after I put on foundation it makes my makeup look cakey.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this brand and got several of these items for Christmas. She loves it!</li>
            <li> Love this primer. Have used many. This one is perfect</li>
            <li> Does what it says it will. Great product.</li>
