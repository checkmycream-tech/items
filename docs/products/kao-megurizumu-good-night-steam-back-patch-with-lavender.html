            <li> I can sleep like a baby&lt;br /&gt;with this</li>
            <li> Package received with slight damage.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s working or not</li>
            <li> comfortable! Release my pain but easy to drop</li>
            <li> These come individually wrapped and would be convenient to travel. Just open and they activate. They are thin and would not be noticeable under clothing. It also comes in lavender that I&#x27;d love to try, but I&#x27;m allergic to that particular plant.  I love these patches! I place them right below my neck, as shown on the illustration on the box. It heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t get excruciatingly hot, just right in my opinion. I don&#x27;t use these every night, just when feeling tension in my shoulders (about 50% of the time). Today, it helped me through a tough headache I woke up with. I got my child to school and applied one before taking a nap, and I woke up refreshed and ready for the day. I just placed an order for more and also ordered a similar product from the same company. They are great for getting to sleep, but don&#x27;t last all that long. I&#x27;m hoping the other product has a longer life.</li>
