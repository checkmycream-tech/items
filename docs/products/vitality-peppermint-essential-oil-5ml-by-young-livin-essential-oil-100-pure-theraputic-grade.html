            <li>It is nice to know that what you are using on the body or around the home is safe enough to ingest.  </li>

            <li>Left my mouth nice and minty, no nasty after taste.  </li>
            <li>And Young Living is definitely the best.</li>
            <li>The best always with Young Living essential oils.</li>
            <li>: that&#x27;s how good it is) and minutes after consumption I notice instant results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are many other uses, but I find that the Young Living brand is definitely the highest quality and perfect for what I need.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely in my first aid oil kit!</li>

            <li>puts us right to sleep</li>
            <li>The only warning is that this is very strong and you should never put it around your eye area or you&#x27;ll be walking around with one eye shut for a spell.  </li>
            <li>I put 2 drops in the bottom of my Brita water filter container, then put it back together and let the water filter through down into where I have placed the peppermint water and every time I get water from it, its delicious.</li>
            <li>Second bottle top appeared opened at one time, but smelled more like Young Living Peppermint oil.  </li>

            <li>Helps my husband very much with his feet.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Funny that I am a distributer YLE Oils</li>
            <li>our favorite essential oil.  </li>
            <li>I have found this works much, much better than all the natural (somewhat chemical free) deodorants on the market and works as well as commercial deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to a friend who introduced me to oils, I fell in love with peppermint oil, especially this brand.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Young Living Peppermint Oil is clean, crisp and pure.  </li>
            <li>would absolutely buy this product again, and would absolutely recommend it to friends!</li>
            <li>to learn more uses for the oils, i highly recommend getting an essential oil guide book.</li>
            <li>Took a long time to ship, but loved it once I finally received it!</li>
            <li>This particular peppermint oil is my first choice for treating a headache.</li>
            <li>Works really fast, too.  </li>
            <li>Meds just weren&#x27;t helping me much.  </li>
            <li>but, this ones smells like the real thing.</li>
            <li>much else to say</li>
            <li>Clears up nose fast.</li>
            <li>Absolutely can not be without this product.</li>
            <li>I do love Young Living Essential Oils, and buying them from Amazon is very convenient.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about Young Living Essential Oils.</li>
            <li>Other reviewers have listed even more uses.</li>
            <li>so I mainly got it for that</li>
            <li>Have several other brands of Peppermint Oil but truly love having the Young Living Peppermint as it is a true smell in comparison to others.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend without hesitation.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the quality, didn&#x27;t need much to get the affects of the peppermint.  </li>
            <li>fact that the oils are pure enough to use internally is something that I am super fond of.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to see results from consistent daily use</li>
            <li>and it keeps my nose clear.</li>
            <li>I am a reasonably sane person, but if someone had told me a simply oil would help me face and scalp overnight</li>
            <li>You can put it in lotions or on your skin directly and it doesn&#x27;t burn you.  </li>
            <li>I am grateful to have been introduced to Young Living oils.</li>
            <li>I purchased this oil to mix with Young Living&#x27;s panaway oil for pain.</li>
            <li>I will not order from this vendor again, will order directly from Young Living.  </li>
            <li>Young Living oil is never greasy or slimy, like what I received.  </li>
            <li>Keep far away from eyes and wash hands after using.</li>
            <li>but if you a newbie to this and have an urge to put more drops in because its not strong enough - wait overnight and then taste it.</li>
            <li>A drop in my water has really helped me with my chronic stomach upset due to stress...feels very soothing.</li>
            <li>I bought this after returning a different brand of oil that was not 100% pure, even though it was said to be (apparently it has to do with what counts as \\&quot;pure\\&quot; according to US law?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The aroma seems weaker and different than my older bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I mix a little on my hand with some organic sweet almond oil and rub the mixture under my arms.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, one of the bottles was opened, leaked all over the other contents in the box and was a VERY oily consistancy.....with strong sweet peppermint aroma, not typical of Young Living oil.  </li>
            <li>It is relaxing, and really helps after a long day.</li>
            <li>As a fan of peppermint flavors and scents, the sickeningly sweet smells that I sometimes get from other peppermint oils is a big problem..</li>
            <li>Compared to other oils, I find YL Peppermint to be much more like that of the peppermint plant and a lot less like a candy cane.</li>
            <li>Drop on the tongue works great for bad breath.</li>
            <li>I only buy Young Living Oils since I have learned over the years that you get what you pay for when it comes to oils.</li>
            <li>I spent way too much money on ineffective oils.</li>
            <li>Every home should have Young Living Essential Peppermint Oil.</li>
            <li>I only ordered it on Amazon as I could get it quicker than from Young Living.  </li>
            <li>I will only buy Young Living oils</li>
            <li>I am a fan of Young Living Essential Oils because of their purity.  </li>
            <li>Young living is the only essential oil I&#x27;ve seen that you can actually ingest.</li>

            <li> puts us right to sleep</li>
            <li> The only warning is that this is very strong and you should never put it around your eye area or you&#x27;ll be walking around with one eye shut for a spell.  </li>
            <li> I put 2 drops in the bottom of my Brita water filter container, then put it back together and let the water filter through down into where I have placed the peppermint water and every time I get water from it, its delicious.</li>
            <li> Second bottle top appeared opened at one time, but smelled more like Young Living Peppermint oil.  </li>
            <li> Smells amazing, feels like icy hot when you put it on, and helps wake you up on the morning!</li>
            <li> love these oils&amp;#62; I put them in my diffuser with in seconds my entire house smells like a breath of fresh air.</li>
            <li> Helps my husband very much with his feet.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Funny that I am a distributer YLE Oils</li>
            <li> our favorite essential oil.  </li>
            <li> I have found this works much, much better than all the natural (somewhat chemical free) deodorants on the market and works as well as commercial deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to a friend who introduced me to oils, I fell in love with peppermint oil, especially this brand.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Young Living Peppermint Oil is clean, crisp and pure.  </li>
            <li> would absolutely buy this product again, and would absolutely recommend it to friends!</li>
            <li> to learn more uses for the oils, i highly recommend getting an essential oil guide book.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to ship, but loved it once I finally received it!</li>
            <li> This particular peppermint oil is my first choice for treating a headache.</li>
            <li> Works really fast, too.  </li>
            <li> Meds just weren&#x27;t helping me much.  </li>
            <li> but, this ones smells like the real thing.</li>
            <li> much else to say</li>
            <li> Clears up nose fast.</li>
            <li> Absolutely can not be without this product.</li>
            <li> I do love Young Living Essential Oils, and buying them from Amazon is very convenient.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about Young Living Essential Oils.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have listed even more uses.</li>
            <li> so I mainly got it for that</li>
            <li> Have several other brands of Peppermint Oil but truly love having the Young Living Peppermint as it is a true smell in comparison to others.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend without hesitation.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the quality, didn&#x27;t need much to get the affects of the peppermint.  </li>
            <li> fact that the oils are pure enough to use internally is something that I am super fond of.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see results from consistent daily use</li>
            <li> and it keeps my nose clear.</li>
            <li> I am a reasonably sane person, but if someone had told me a simply oil would help me face and scalp overnight</li>
            <li> You can put it in lotions or on your skin directly and it doesn&#x27;t burn you.  </li>
            <li> I am grateful to have been introduced to Young Living oils.</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil to mix with Young Living&#x27;s panaway oil for pain.</li>
            <li> I will not order from this vendor again, will order directly from Young Living.  </li>
            <li> Young Living oil is never greasy or slimy, like what I received.  </li>
            <li> Keep far away from eyes and wash hands after using.</li>
            <li> but if you a newbie to this and have an urge to put more drops in because its not strong enough - wait overnight and then taste it.</li>
            <li> A drop in my water has really helped me with my chronic stomach upset due to stress...feels very soothing.</li>
            <li> I bought this after returning a different brand of oil that was not 100% pure, even though it was said to be (apparently it has to do with what counts as \\&quot;pure\\&quot; according to US law?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The aroma seems weaker and different than my older bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mix a little on my hand with some organic sweet almond oil and rub the mixture under my arms.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, one of the bottles was opened, leaked all over the other contents in the box and was a VERY oily consistancy.....with strong sweet peppermint aroma, not typical of Young Living oil.  </li>
            <li> It is relaxing, and really helps after a long day.</li>
            <li> As a fan of peppermint flavors and scents, the sickeningly sweet smells that I sometimes get from other peppermint oils is a big problem..</li>
            <li> Compared to other oils, I find YL Peppermint to be much more like that of the peppermint plant and a lot less like a candy cane.</li>
            <li> Drop on the tongue works great for bad breath.</li>
            <li> I only buy Young Living Oils since I have learned over the years that you get what you pay for when it comes to oils.</li>
            <li> I spent way too much money on ineffective oils.</li>
            <li> Every home should have Young Living Essential Peppermint Oil.</li>
            <li> I only ordered it on Amazon as I could get it quicker than from Young Living.  </li>
            <li> I will only buy Young Living oils</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Young Living Essential Oils because of their purity.  </li>
            <li> Young living is the only essential oil I&#x27;ve seen that you can actually ingest.</li>
            <li> this lil bottle will last me for a long time.</li>
            <li> and it can make it worse and not cold enough</li>
            <li> The oil I received was NOT Young Living Oil.  </li>
            <li> I have tried all types of other peppermint oils and they just are not the same.</li>
            <li> so I use it under my nose to open my sinuses and a small drop on the back of my tongue to help open them up.  </li>
            <li> In addition, just a few dabs under one&#x27;s nose not only clears up the congestion but also has an extremely pleasing aroma.</li>
            <li> A little drop goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Now, we use it for a lot of other things.  </li>
            <li> That is a lot of use out of such a small bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so a few drops goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> I have never been disappointed with a Young Living oil and this is actually the second time that I have had to purchase this specific oil.  </li>
            <li> It calms it down.</li>
            <li> would &#x27;recommend it for anyone who would like a slight relieving of pain.</li>
            <li> I use it in the office, on my wrists, or to diffuse for a little time into a room.</li>
            <li> I then added a few drops to water and rinse my hair</li>
            <li> I put a few drops on a few cotton balls and placed them strategically in her trunk...</li>
            <li> I also keep a small spray bottle with water and a few drops of peppermint oil as a breath freshener through out the day.</li>
            <li> My daughter usually has a runny nose</li>
            <li> and it usually helps.</li>
            <li> I put a drop in a small amount of water and use it as a mouthwash in the morning.</li>
            <li> Peppermint oil (along with the Young Living cold diffuser!) has helped a ton with our seasonal allergies.</li>
            <li> and it seems to seriously help.  </li>
            <li> is useless.</li>
            <li> just put it behind ears and on throat to help get rid of cold.</li>
            <li> I have chronic migraines that don&#x27;t always do well with ice packs, too cold</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Use all the time for headache</li>
            <li> This is an incredible product that truly aids the digestive system.  Works really fast, too.  One drop in a glass of water (must be glass since this oil eats away plastic: that&#x27;s how good it is) and minutes after consumption I notice instant results.  The smell is truly refreshing and serves as a great pick me up.  Add it to your morning coffee and it&#x27;s an exceptional drink!  Can&#x27;t wait to see results from consistent daily use: I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s truly amazing!</li>
            <li> Peppermint oil (along with the Young Living cold diffuser!) has helped a ton with our seasonal allergies. My daughter usually has a runny nose almost year-round because she is so allergic to whatever is in the air here in Arkansas.  This oil (along with the diffuser) has been a God-send! I only buy Young Living Oils since I have learned over the years that you get what you pay for when it comes to oils. I spent way too much money on ineffective oils.</li>
            <li> I mix this with some coconut body cream and I rub it on my sore muscles. It smells good and feels good.  It also arrived quickly and was wrapped securely.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have chronic migraines that don&#x27;t always do well with ice packs, too cold and it can make it worse and not cold enough is useless. One of my nurses recommended this product and while I still take my abortive migraine medication, this gem rubbed on my temple will bring immediate and soothing pain relief while I wait for the meds to kick in. It also helps with sinus relief if you put just a tiny bit on the side of your nose. The only warning is that this is very strong and you should never put it around your eye area or you&#x27;ll be walking around with one eye shut for a spell.  It might be expensive but this is the real deal and worth it for the instant relief of pain it provides.</li>
            <li> Young Living is a Superb product. I put this on my temples for a headache. I put in my water to aide digestion and it is so refreshing to drink. Drop on the tongue works great for bad breath. I add Peppermint oil to my teas and lotions. Helps achy joints and muscles. Feels good on belly for tummy ache. There is so many possibilities for the use of this oil. I Highly recommend and believe this to be the best Peppermint oil out there.</li>
            <li> Its a good product...this lil bottle will last me for a long time. I use it in my coffee sometimes. Sometimes in my water...one drop in a gallon.. All u need.</li>
            <li> Loving my YL oils! And these prices are great!</li>
            <li> Young Living Peppermint Oil is clean, crisp and pure.  I use it when I have any sort of congestion or &#x27;brain fog&#x27;-- just give it a sniff and my head clears right away.  I carry it in my purse.  I am the go-to person for headaches because this works like nothing else.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to ship, but loved it once I finally received it! We use peppermint oil DAILY in my home!</li>
            <li> Thanks to a friend who introduced me to oils, I fell in love with peppermint oil, especially this brand.&lt;br /&gt;I had seborhheic dermatitis on my face and scalp.  Meds just weren&#x27;t helping me much.  If the medications, and there were a lot, did work, it would be over a period of days!  I tried the pappermint oil! And overnight, honest, the redness, itching and flaking went away. No lie! I then added a few drops to water and rinse my hair and it helped my scalp itching too.  I am a reasonably sane person, but if someone had told me a simply oil would help me face and scalp overnight I would not have believed it. And I cannot say it will work for you, but I can only honestly report what it did for me.  Now, we use it for a lot of other things.  Look peppermint oil on the internet and see what it is supposed to help. We did.  Now I put it on my neck *(I had a neck injury), my husbands shoulder, breath it in for sinus... and it seems to seriously help.  I have even told my doctor about it.... We are believers and this brand seems to be more potent than others.  Nope, I do not work for the company, I just am so thrilled to have my seborrheic dermatitis improved !!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Incredibly helpful for my chronic migraines!</li>
            <li> An excellent oil. :) It&#x27;s pure, edible - great. I bought this after returning a different brand of oil that was not 100% pure, even though it was said to be (apparently it has to do with what counts as \\&quot;pure\\&quot; according to US law?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this stuff is awesome. So far I&#x27;ve been using it mostly to keep away mosquitos (mix w/ carrier oil, rub on skin), and it works great!</li>
            <li> My wife uses doTerra oils but she takes this peppermint oil away from me because she likes it better. It&#x27;s help with congestion, and stomach relief. Can&#x27;t help but smelling this every morning to get my morning started.</li>
            <li> I have never been disappointed with a Young Living oil and this is actually the second time that I have had to purchase this specific oil.  The last one was this same size and I had it and was a liberal user of it for four years.  That is a lot of use out of such a small bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that the oils are pure enough to use internally is something that I am super fond of.  It is nice to know that what you are using on the body or around the home is safe enough to ingest.  Oh and it makes a great addition if you add a drop to a cup of coffee.</li>
            <li> This is another favorite. I dab some on my temples being careful not to be near my eyes. It is relaxing, and really helps after a long day. I use it in the office, on my wrists, or to diffuse for a little time into a room. Lovely!</li>
            <li> these are great products and the oils are very potent. to learn more uses for the oils, i highly recommend getting an essential oil guide book.</li>
            <li> Young living has the best essential oils I&#x27;ve ever found. I use the peppermint and the laveder together in the water in my c-papto help me sleep better. Peppermint helps with headaches, and clears my sinuses. I ruba drop in my hand and smell iit when I get a headache and it usually helps. I also rub some into my skin when I have a muscle ache. Young living is the only essential oil I&#x27;ve seen that you can actually ingest.</li>
            <li> Helps my husband very much with his feet.</li>
            <li> I am in love with Young Living Peppermint oil. A drop in my water has really helped me with my chronic stomach upset due to stress...feels very soothing. Compared to other oils, I find YL Peppermint to be much more like that of the peppermint plant and a lot less like a candy cane. As a fan of peppermint flavors and scents, the sickeningly sweet smells that I sometimes get from other peppermint oils is a big problem..but, this ones smells like the real thing. I also diffuse this for my kids to aid in focus and concentration, and think that it is doing well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely buy this product again, and would absolutely recommend it to friends!</li>
            <li> This smells like fresh peppermint and is great to smell to keep you awake and alert during the day.  It is also wonderful on sore achy muscles.  My favorite combo is peppermint and lemon.</li>
            <li> Nice quality oil and lightening fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This is great smelling good quality peppermint oil. You can put it in lotions or on your skin directly and it doesn&#x27;t burn you.  It&#x27;s pricey but you get what you pay for. It&#x27;s also very strong so a few drops goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to add to my DIY mouth rinse.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality, didn&#x27;t need much to get the affects of the peppermint.  Left my mouth nice and minty, no nasty after taste.  Smells amazing too!</li>
            <li> I use it to flavor my homemade toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Have several other brands of Peppermint Oil but truly love having the Young Living Peppermint as it is a true smell in comparison to others.</li>
            <li> Every home should have Young Living Essential Peppermint Oil.</li>
            <li> Received this product very quickly and I love the size and price.</li>
            <li> Love it I want to always have some on hand for a multitude of uses.</li>
            <li> Love it. Helps with pain managment.</li>
            <li> I use this peppermint oil in my water because it is great for digestive issues and I just love it. I have tried all types of other peppermint oils and they just are not the same. I put 2 drops in the bottom of my Brita water filter container, then put it back together and let the water filter through down into where I have placed the peppermint water and every time I get water from it, its delicious. Warning: the longer the filtered water sits in the refrigerator the stronger it gets - I like it best that way anyway but if you a newbie to this and have an urge to put more drops in because its not strong enough - wait overnight and then taste it. Be sure you are not putting the drops in the top part of your container but in the bottom. I was thrilled I found this on Amazon and fulfilled through Amazon because as a Prime member I got it in 2 days! Great product, appreciative for the seller putting it on Amazon and great price.</li>
            <li> I use for headaches by running it into temple.  It works sometimes, but not all the time.  Also, my wife had some mice that were getting into the trunk of her car.  I heard that mice can&#x27;t stand the smell of peppermint.  I put a few drops on a few cotton balls and placed them strategically in her trunk...mice problem solved.  This one is consumable, I like to mix it in my tea.</li>
            <li> One of the essentials for so many uses (from fever to tummy troubles). It&#x27;s definitely in my first aid oil kit!</li>
            <li> Peppermint oil is known to reduce some pain.  I use this on my neuropathy of my toes when they start burning.  It relieves my burning so I can sleep.&lt;br /&gt;I would &#x27;recommend it for anyone who would like a slight relieving of pain.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes the house smell great.</li>
            <li> I am grateful to have been introduced to Young Living oils. The quality is excellent. I purchased this oil to mix with Young Living&#x27;s panaway oil for pain. The peppermint oil boosts the effectiveness of the panaway. It also works great mixed with panaway oil and coconut oil to make a great pain relief cream.</li>
            <li> we use it for better sleep</li>
            <li> I bought this peppermint oil since it is food grade quality. I put a drop in a small amount of water and use it as a mouthwash in the morning. I also keep a small spray bottle with water and a few drops of peppermint oil as a breath freshener through out the day. The peppermint makes my mouth feel so fresh. I&#x27;m sure there are many other uses, but I find that the Young Living brand is definitely the highest quality and perfect for what I need. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Peppermint essential oil is a staple for me. I use it for lots of things including indigestion. And Young Living is definitely the best.</li>
            <li> On time delivery.  Young Living oils is great</li>
            <li> The best always with Young Living essential oils. This peppermint oil is absolutely amazing and well concentrated. Highly recommend without hesitation.</li>
            <li> I ordered two peppermint oils and received the order today.  Unfortunately, one of the bottles was opened, leaked all over the other contents in the box and was a VERY oily consistancy.....with strong sweet peppermint aroma, not typical of Young Living oil.  In fact, the oil was so greasy I had to use Dawn liquid to wash it off my hands and box contents.  Second bottle top appeared opened at one time, but smelled more like Young Living Peppermint oil.  I would know, as I am also a distributor.  I only ordered it on Amazon as I could get it quicker than from Young Living.  I will not order from this vendor again, will order directly from Young Living.  The oil I received was NOT Young Living Oil.  Young Living oil is never greasy or slimy, like what I received.  Total ripoff.</li>
            <li> Funny that I am a distributer YLE Oils and I can get the product cheaper on Amazon than I can ordering through my discount. I love this line of oils, and the pepermint works great for anxeity, upset tummy, in hot teas, and general well-being. I am definitely ordering from this seller again!</li>
            <li> it smells great at first but after a while it starts to smell bad,kind of stale,which was surprising because it is supposed to be a high quality product.</li>
            <li> our favorite essential oil.  Great for indigestion, sinus discomfort, stiff neck...and it is a great pick-me-up when fatigued, just sniff a bit!</li>
            <li> A great massage oil. Helpful for tendonitis . Very good !</li>
            <li> I trust this brand.  I have many uses for peppermint oil.  I have a lot of sinus problems so I use it under my nose to open my sinuses and a small drop on the back of my tongue to help open them up.  I also use a drop on my tongue as a breath freshener.  Essential oils can also be used as a deodorant (never after shaving).  I mix a little on my hand with some organic sweet almond oil and rub the mixture under my arms.  I have found this works much, much better than all the natural (somewhat chemical free) deodorants on the market and works as well as commercial deodorant.  Bonus - this truly is chemical free!</li>
            <li> Very Satisfied with getting this so quickly...I use this a lot!</li>
            <li> Good product, came quickly &amp; will buy again when available.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality oil.</li>
            <li> I use this when my stomach acts up.  It calms it down.</li>
            <li> help with so many things!</li>
            <li> I will only buy Young Living oils</li>
            <li> Not my favorite oil right now. The aroma seems weaker and different than my older bottle.&lt;br /&gt;So consistency may be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;Not much else to say but amazon.com requires 20 words to leave feedback.</li>
            <li> love this smell in the diffuser.  puts us right to sleep</li>
            <li> we use it for colds. just put it behind ears and on throat to help get rid of cold. Clears up nose fast. Keep away from eyes.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product is exactly as stated; happy with purchase</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this Peppermint Oil...you can use this for so many things. Love Young Living Products.</li>
            <li> love these oils&amp;#62; I put them in my diffuser with in seconds my entire house smells like a breath of fresh air.</li>
            <li> Works great for nausea.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Young Living Essential Oils because of their purity.  I use peppermint for my homemade toothpaste, oil pulling and when I have a stuffy nose.  I put some on a cotton ball when I get my weekly massage and it keeps my nose clear.</li>
            <li> Absolutely can not be without this product. This particular peppermint oil is my first choice for treating a headache. Great for &amp;#34;waking up&amp;#34;, clearing fog, and for sore muscles. A little drop goes a long way. Keep far away from eyes and wash hands after using.</li>
            <li> I do love Young Living Essential Oils, and buying them from Amazon is very convenient.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for headaches &amp; clearing sinuses.</li>
            <li> Helped my wife with stomach troubles!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, feels like icy hot when you put it on, and helps wake you up on the morning! You can diffuse it, apply it topically (mixed with coconut oil), or put it in drink/food.</li>
            <li> I have digestive problems so I mainly got it for that, I just put a drop in my water and it evn helped my menstrual cramps, not to mention keeps my breath fresh</li>
            <li> This oil has so many uses that I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it. Great for headaches, bug bites, burns, belly aches, fever (put on back of neck), allergies, putting in water for taste. Other reviewers have listed even more uses. It&#x27;s like an all-purpose elixir. Honestly, for me it would be worth twice its cost.</li>
            <li> This works as good as any nasal spray my husband has tried on his own or his doctor has prescribed. In addition, just a few dabs under one&#x27;s nose not only clears up the congestion but also has an extremely pleasing aroma. My husband uses it and has given some to others who also like it. He and I both recommend it for temporary relief on nasal congestion.</li>
            <li> Highest rating if give it great</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for stomach problems and so is the DiGize oil</li>
            <li> This oil works great in homemade mouth wash, cleaning products and in diffusers. I pair it with thieves because it tames one of the more \\&quot;rotten\\&quot; smelling thieves odors and adds to its effectiveness IMO.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about Young Living Essential Oils. Peppermint is one of my favorite oils, it has so many uses! If you&#x27;re looking for an oil to try, give this one a chance.</li>
