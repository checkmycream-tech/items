            <li>However, it works fine for me, and I am very pleased with the quality.</li>

            <li>I am so glad I bought this.  </li>
            <li>It is very sturdy construction and is a great help to me as my eyesight diminishes.</li>
            <li>Most mirrors</li>
            <li>be sure to measure and locate the mirror before attaching it to the wall.</li>
            <li>, 10x is so much better.  </li>
            <li>Glad I choose this mirror.</li>
            <li>She used one at a hotel and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I chose this mirror after reading of difficulties with many illuminated mirrors that have the bulbs blow out.  </li>
            <li>With this mirror, I am able to put on makeup, pluck eyebrows, etc.</li>
            <li>I do love it and wish I would have bought one sooner.</li>
            <li>but I love this for eye makeup.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m tall trying to use one that sets on a table top which is a pain.</li>
            <li>Maginfication is wonderful especially for applying make-up, tweezing, etc.</li>
            <li>Much better than a handheld model.</li>
            <li>I love this mirror.</li>
            <li>8x is perfect for those of us middle ager&#x27;s who can&#x27;t see to put on our makeup</li>
            <li>I can see much better to put contact lenses in, tweezing, etc.</li>
            <li>It will be much better I think.</li>
            <li>I love this mirror.</li>
            <li>My husband put better anchors in the wall than what it came with</li>
            <li>the bigger side is excellent for putting on my makeup and tweezing my eyebrows!!!</li>
            <li>I love this mirror.</li>
            <li>Has great magnification, but you have to be in the right light.  </li>
            <li>I bought this after staying in a very nice hotel in san diego that had a similar one and my wife loved it.  </li>
            <li>The chrome is deep and rich and the arms work perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery, good quality.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to use and cleans up like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It was easy to mount.  </li>
            <li>Easy to see and convenient to have fold against the wall.</li>
            <li>Easy to install.</li>
            <li>Easy to use 2 part hanging hardware</li>
            <li>Still, it went up easily.</li>
            <li>mounts easily.</li>
            <li>Sturdy, strong wall mount.  </li>
            <li>It really is amazing how much I didn&#x27;t see before!  </li>
            <li>The magnification is strong and you have to get fairly close to the mirror for it to be clear (not distorted)</li>
            <li>This one was the happy medium that finally stopped the makeup mirror hunt.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The swivel is smooth and the mirror moves vertically so that you can change the angle depending on your needs.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this was a great purchase.</li>
            <li>and it has stayed secure.</li>
            <li>but I wish it had a light.</li>
            <li>and I want it to look great from the back of my head as it does from the front..</li>
            <li>Great magnifying mirror and extension arm allows you to turn it in several directions.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel cheap at all.</li>
            <li>but if you can buy the one with a light.  </li>
            <li>The wall mounting was quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and was easy to install.</li>
            <li>this mag mirror is very high quality at a very surprising low price.</li>
            <li>This mirror was such a good purchase.</li>
            <li>good product that works well when applying make up or facial products</li>
            <li>Nice clear view on both sides.</li>
            <li>Thanks again, I love it....</li>
            <li>and since I&#x27;m short I placed it at a good height.  </li>
            <li>Love this mirror, much easier to apply my makeup.</li>
            <li>No light, which we don&#x27;t need and certainly isn&#x27;t oversided, but it is perfect for her needs.  </li>
            <li>But other than that, this baby works great.</li>
            <li>So other than having to do the job twice that I wanted to do once, it&#x27;s a great item.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased a 10x from a bedding store and could not  see without distortion ( too powerful).</li>
            <li>I liked that it was easy to install and fits flat against the wall when not in use.</li>
            <li>Easy to mount on wall; very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>But now this makes it easy to handle all those two handed jobs and stand up straight.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment and easy mount.</li>
            <li>Seems sturdy, very functional, &amp; was fairly easy to install.</li>
            <li>Exactly what we were looking for!  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>was a bit snarky about putting much faith in Amazon reviewers and told me the anchors that this came with would work just fine.  </li>
            <li>I would have liked a little more.</li>
            <li>She has always used a free standing makeup mirror and found this one much easier.</li>
            <li>This mirror is totally worth its weight in gold.</li>
            <li>Screwed it directly into the wood because we thought in time it would pull out of the drywall, even with better anchors.</li>
            <li>Finish is nice, well-made overall.</li>
            <li>Magnification is just right for applying makeup.</li>
            <li>the magnification is great and the other side is normal.  </li>
            <li>It was very easy to install and folds flat against the wall when not in use.</li>
            <li>The cover plate which hides the screws makes installation and removal easy and professional.</li>
            <li>We made the right choice, this mirror looks very simple and elegant.</li>
            <li>Very high magnifying!</li>
            <li>The magnification is accurate and higher power than mirrors I frequently encounter in hotels.</li>
            <li>I wanted a second mirror for my guest bathroom, so this one won&#x27;t be used as often, but I&#x27;m sure my guests will appreciate it.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what my wife was looking for.</li>
            <li>When staying at a high-end hotel in FL, I enjoyed a mirror such as this.  </li>
            <li>I researched all sorts, I feel that the eight times magnifier really does the job for putting on makeup to perfection!</li>
            <li>exactly as advertised.love it.</li>
            <li>My husband uses it as much as I do!</li>
            <li>and my wife  commented several times how much she enjoyed that mirror being mounted on the wall.  </li>
            <li>8x magnification is plenty;  almost too much ;-)  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this mirror to all who needs a lil help with seeing back of head n applying makeup.:)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to install, but one of my screws is only about 90% flush with the wall.</li>
            <li>Easy to mount and very solid...</li>
            <li>So easy to see and style the back of my hair,.plus</li>
            <li>If you are getting a little older and your eyes just aren&#x27;t quite like they used to be, you too will love this product!</li>
            <li>which was too much.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t realize how much of a decrease it would be to go to 8x.</li>
            <li>Maybe too much since now</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really wanna to explain why I&#x27;ve chosen this item.</li>
            <li>If you really need assistance with seeing things closely, this fits the bill.  </li>
            <li>This mirror is very adjustable,</li>
            <li>and it was priced very competitively.</li>
            <li>It feels very sturdy.</li>
            <li>With this mirror, I can see everything so clear!!!  </li>
            <li>It has just the right amount of magnification, is clear, and very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>This is just as described and one side magnifies more than the other.</li>
            <li>The price is equal to the quality, the metal stays looking clean.</li>
            <li>We highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The mirrors are very clear, with no blurring around the edges.  </li>
            <li>The first one was bought years ago and is still used daily.</li>
            <li>Mirror is clear and magnification is close...</li>
            <li>the mirror let me see it clearly and remove it with a Q-tip.</li>
            <li>It is crystal clear with no defects on either side.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t think of getting one a lot earlier.</li>
            <li>mirror doesn&#x27;t really have any extra frills.  </li>
            <li>It took a total of about 5-8 minutes and it was up and ready to use.  </li>
            <li>If you are a very picky person about what your hair looks like on the back of your head, then this is the problem solver....</li>
            <li>I like the amount of magnification this mirror provides for my old eyes.  </li>
            <li>Get two decent ones from the hardware store and the fixture will be mounted rock solid.</li>
            <li>My bathroom is small, so I needed a mirror that would mount securely to the wall.</li>
            <li>My only small regret was not getting one with a light built into it.  </li>
            <li>Clear curve of the mirror over the entire surface.</li>
            <li>The mirror tilts up or down, so you can see from the top of your head to down below if you have long hair like I do.</li>
            <li>We were hesitant between this mirror and the one that lights up, but the light on the other one is too low and the price so not worth it.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the arm is kind of stiff.  </li>
            <li>I just want to say, all the Amazon reviewers here are correct about the need to pick up decent anchors other than what is provided.  </li>
            <li>Very strange from my point of view to force to complete reviews...</li>
            <li>(the good and the bad).</li>

            <li> Good</li>
            <li> I set it for my height, making it good for putting on makeup for someone who cannot see well without her glass.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the purchase of this mirror.  </li>
            <li> This mounted well, has good optics, moves nicely through it&#x27;s extents...</li>

            <li> and it was great to have hands free magnification.  </li>
            <li> Nice chrome finish.  </li>
            <li> Had to have one for my own.  </li>
            <li> Nice mirror.</li>
            <li> Nice chrome finish.</li>
            <li> but it would be nice if some screwing hardware was included.</li>
            <li> We took a cruise and really liked having the magnified Wall Mount mirror in the cabin.</li>
            <li> It is kind of a trial and error thing</li>
            <li> We are very happy with this mirror and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is a good size and can be easily moved to positions needed.</li>
            <li> Very easy to install.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to wall mount and all the hardware required was included.</li>
            <li> It moves very easily</li>
            <li> so wonderful to see what i am doing early in the morning!  </li>
            <li> Just what I needed to put on make up without glasses, good size and adequate magnification , nice design and fits against wall.</li>
            <li> but it is great for plucking eyebrows and getting your eyeliner just right.</li>
            <li> easy install!</li>
            <li> However, it works fine for me, and I am very pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li> Being nearsighted it is great to be able to put the mirror right in front of my face so that I can see to put my makeup on.  </li>
            <li> This is a nicely made, easy to use mirror.  </li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought this.  </li>
            <li> It is very sturdy construction and is a great help to me as my eyesight diminishes.</li>
            <li> Most mirrors</li>
            <li> be sure to measure and locate the mirror before attaching it to the wall.</li>
            <li> , 10x is so much better.  </li>
            <li> Glad I choose this mirror.</li>
            <li> She used one at a hotel and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> I chose this mirror after reading of difficulties with many illuminated mirrors that have the bulbs blow out.  </li>
            <li> With this mirror, I am able to put on makeup, pluck eyebrows, etc.</li>
            <li> I do love it and wish I would have bought one sooner.</li>
            <li> but I love this for eye makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tall trying to use one that sets on a table top which is a pain.</li>
            <li> Maginfication is wonderful especially for applying make-up, tweezing, etc.</li>
            <li> Much better than a handheld model.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror.</li>
            <li> 8x is perfect for those of us middle ager&#x27;s who can&#x27;t see to put on our makeup</li>
            <li> I can see much better to put contact lenses in, tweezing, etc.</li>
            <li> It will be much better I think.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror.</li>
            <li> My husband put better anchors in the wall than what it came with</li>
            <li> the bigger side is excellent for putting on my makeup and tweezing my eyebrows!!!</li>
            <li> I love this mirror.</li>
            <li> Has great magnification, but you have to be in the right light.  </li>
            <li> I bought this after staying in a very nice hotel in san diego that had a similar one and my wife loved it.  </li>
            <li> The chrome is deep and rich and the arms work perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery, good quality.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is easy to use and cleans up like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was easy to mount.  </li>
            <li> Easy to see and convenient to have fold against the wall.</li>
            <li> Easy to install.</li>
            <li> Easy to use 2 part hanging hardware</li>
            <li> Still, it went up easily.</li>
            <li> mounts easily.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, strong wall mount.  </li>
            <li> It really is amazing how much I didn&#x27;t see before!  </li>
            <li> The magnification is strong and you have to get fairly close to the mirror for it to be clear (not distorted)</li>
            <li> This one was the happy medium that finally stopped the makeup mirror hunt.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The swivel is smooth and the mirror moves vertically so that you can change the angle depending on your needs.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this was a great purchase.</li>
            <li> and it has stayed secure.</li>
            <li> but I wish it had a light.</li>
            <li> and I want it to look great from the back of my head as it does from the front..</li>
            <li> Great magnifying mirror and extension arm allows you to turn it in several directions.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel cheap at all.</li>
            <li> but if you can buy the one with a light.  </li>
            <li> The wall mounting was quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and was easy to install.</li>
            <li> this mag mirror is very high quality at a very surprising low price.</li>
            <li> This mirror was such a good purchase.</li>
            <li> good product that works well when applying make up or facial products</li>
            <li> Nice clear view on both sides.</li>
            <li> Thanks again, I love it....</li>
            <li> and since I&#x27;m short I placed it at a good height.  </li>
            <li> Love this mirror, much easier to apply my makeup.</li>
            <li> No light, which we don&#x27;t need and certainly isn&#x27;t oversided, but it is perfect for her needs.  </li>
            <li> But other than that, this baby works great.</li>
            <li> So other than having to do the job twice that I wanted to do once, it&#x27;s a great item.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased a 10x from a bedding store and could not  see without distortion ( too powerful).</li>
            <li> I liked that it was easy to install and fits flat against the wall when not in use.</li>
            <li> Easy to mount on wall; very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> But now this makes it easy to handle all those two handed jobs and stand up straight.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment and easy mount.</li>
            <li> Seems sturdy, very functional, &amp; was fairly easy to install.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we were looking for!  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> was a bit snarky about putting much faith in Amazon reviewers and told me the anchors that this came with would work just fine.  </li>
            <li> I would have liked a little more.</li>
            <li> She has always used a free standing makeup mirror and found this one much easier.</li>
            <li> This mirror is totally worth its weight in gold.</li>
            <li> Screwed it directly into the wood because we thought in time it would pull out of the drywall, even with better anchors.</li>
            <li> Finish is nice, well-made overall.</li>
            <li> Magnification is just right for applying makeup.</li>
            <li> the magnification is great and the other side is normal.  </li>
            <li> It was very easy to install and folds flat against the wall when not in use.</li>
            <li> The cover plate which hides the screws makes installation and removal easy and professional.</li>
            <li> We made the right choice, this mirror looks very simple and elegant.</li>
            <li> Very high magnifying!</li>
            <li> The magnification is accurate and higher power than mirrors I frequently encounter in hotels.</li>
            <li> I wanted a second mirror for my guest bathroom, so this one won&#x27;t be used as often, but I&#x27;m sure my guests will appreciate it.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what my wife was looking for.</li>
            <li> When staying at a high-end hotel in FL, I enjoyed a mirror such as this.  </li>
            <li> I researched all sorts, I feel that the eight times magnifier really does the job for putting on makeup to perfection!</li>
            <li> exactly as advertised.love it.</li>
            <li> My husband uses it as much as I do!</li>
            <li> and my wife  commented several times how much she enjoyed that mirror being mounted on the wall.  </li>
            <li> 8x magnification is plenty;  almost too much ;-)  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this mirror to all who needs a lil help with seeing back of head n applying makeup.:)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to install, but one of my screws is only about 90% flush with the wall.</li>
            <li> Easy to mount and very solid...</li>
            <li> So easy to see and style the back of my hair,.plus</li>
            <li> If you are getting a little older and your eyes just aren&#x27;t quite like they used to be, you too will love this product!</li>
            <li> which was too much.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t realize how much of a decrease it would be to go to 8x.</li>
            <li> Maybe too much since now</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really wanna to explain why I&#x27;ve chosen this item.</li>
            <li> If you really need assistance with seeing things closely, this fits the bill.  </li>
            <li> This mirror is very adjustable,</li>
            <li> and it was priced very competitively.</li>
            <li> It feels very sturdy.</li>
            <li> With this mirror, I can see everything so clear!!!  </li>
            <li> It has just the right amount of magnification, is clear, and very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> This is just as described and one side magnifies more than the other.</li>
            <li> The price is equal to the quality, the metal stays looking clean.</li>
            <li> We highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The mirrors are very clear, with no blurring around the edges.  </li>
            <li> The first one was bought years ago and is still used daily.</li>
            <li> Mirror is clear and magnification is close...</li>
            <li> the mirror let me see it clearly and remove it with a Q-tip.</li>
            <li> It is crystal clear with no defects on either side.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t think of getting one a lot earlier.</li>
            <li> mirror doesn&#x27;t really have any extra frills.  </li>
            <li> It took a total of about 5-8 minutes and it was up and ready to use.  </li>
            <li> If you are a very picky person about what your hair looks like on the back of your head, then this is the problem solver....</li>
            <li> I like the amount of magnification this mirror provides for my old eyes.  </li>
            <li> Get two decent ones from the hardware store and the fixture will be mounted rock solid.</li>
            <li> My bathroom is small, so I needed a mirror that would mount securely to the wall.</li>
            <li> My only small regret was not getting one with a light built into it.  </li>
            <li> Clear curve of the mirror over the entire surface.</li>
            <li> The mirror tilts up or down, so you can see from the top of your head to down below if you have long hair like I do.</li>
            <li> We were hesitant between this mirror and the one that lights up, but the light on the other one is too low and the price so not worth it.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the arm is kind of stiff.  </li>
            <li> I just want to say, all the Amazon reviewers here are correct about the need to pick up decent anchors other than what is provided.  </li>
            <li> Very strange from my point of view to force to complete reviews...</li>
            <li> (the good and the bad).</li>
            <li> This was an open box for about half the normal price.</li>
            <li> It mounted well, feels substantial, expands and pivots but also goes back flat against the wall.</li>
            <li> The arm is long enough to view my hair in the back, but could be an inch or two longer.  </li>
            <li> lies flat and out of the way</li>
            <li> The second one was a little stiff to swivel but that was easily taken care of by a little WD 40.</li>
            <li> The swivel and long arm length extends the mirror almost to any position needed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to get one of these.</li>
            <li> If your vision is at all limited in any way</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish, because I&#x27;m middle-aged, is that the magnification was a little stronger.</li>
            <li> I made a mental note to purchase one for a Christmas stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> Amazon reviewers were right, hardware store man WRONG.  </li>
            <li> It is much less expensive than similar items from Restoration Hardware, yet it is very sturdy and well built.</li>
            <li> However it feels a little flimsy and not sure how long it will last.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 other mirrors from box stores that I had to return before she found this one.  </li>
            <li> I was not sure what magnification to get and could have used less that an 8X, probably would get a 5X or so next time.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I should have gotten a 10x if they sell one.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I need the lighted mirror, which would be very bulky, making it difficult to fold flush against the wall.</li>
            <li> This is just like one I previously purchased from Bed, Bath,and Beyond except that one was 5X magnification.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend using toggle bolts to attach the mounting bracket to the wall, as repeated use of the swing arm will soon loosen the typical wall anchors included with the mirror.</li>
            <li> They will loosen-up quickly because they are badly engineered and should be tossed.  </li>
            <li> Although a little oil was needed to lubricate the joints</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> Works well seems installed it a few days ago</li>
            <li> Applying make-up, especially to my eyes, had become difficult, due to the fact that I need glasses to see up close.  </li>
            <li> My eyesight has deteriorated over the past few years to the point that I can not longer use my 5X mirror to see close up.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is faulty of the product, or of my boyfriend who installed it.</li>
            <li> Performs well in small areas.</li>
            <li> this mirror is just what I have been looking for the past year - how did I manage without it?</li>
            <li> they obsess over their pores for creepy long periods of time.</li>
            <li> Quality isn&#x27;t bad, but the anchors that came with it didn&#x27;t seem substantial enough.  </li>
            <li> My vision is getting worse</li>
            <li> I had a irritating cinder that blew into my eye and the magnifying</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason people have a difficult time mounting the unit.  </li>
            <li> I have used the oven to roast chicken, bake and toast.</li>

            <li> Perfect for seeing close-up.  I liked that it was easy to install and fits flat against the wall when not in use.</li>
            <li> I have had this mirror for 6 months, and it is an excellent product. It is much less expensive than similar items from Restoration Hardware, yet it is very sturdy and well built.</li>
            <li> This mirror is totally worth its weight in gold. I really don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t think of getting one a lot earlier. I think I got inspired after I went on vacation and had one at a hotel. The price is equal to the quality, the metal stays looking clean. It&#x27;s easy to install, but one of my screws is only about 90% flush with the wall. I am not sure if this is faulty of the product, or of my boyfriend who installed it. It definitely is sturdy and never worry of it detaching.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror!  It has just the right amount of magnification, is clear, and very sturdy.  The arm is long enough to view my hair in the back, but could be an inch or two longer.  However, it works fine for me, and I am very pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li> We remodeled our bathroom and when we did I had to remove our magnifying mirror. We were lost without it.  So we purchased another one and had it installed - did are so very happy with this purchase.  The 8 times magnification is perfect for tweezing eyebrows and putting on make-up. My husband likes it for grooming his mustache and goatee.  We highly recommend it.  It is just as the picture and description states.</li>
            <li> I have used the oven to roast chicken, bake and toast. It is wonderful. Don&#x27;t know why I waited so long.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use and cleans up like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mirror for my Mom for Christmas. She had used my mirror in my bathroom, and she wanted one just like it for herself. Being nearsighted it is great to be able to put the mirror right in front of my face so that I can see to put my makeup on.  It was very easy to install and folds flat against the wall when not in use.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought this.  It was easy to mount.  My vision is getting worse but now I can see when I am putting on my makeup.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the purchase of this mirror.  It is very sturdy construction and is a great help to me as my eyesight diminishes.</li>
            <li> Easy to see and convenient to have fold against the wall.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we were looking for!  Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, strong wall mount.  Can double as a hand towel holder etc.  Mirror is clear and magnification is close... too close some days.</li>
            <li> Always wanted to have magnifying mirror for my bathroom for close up tasks.  This one fits the bill.  My only complaint is that the arm is kind of stiff.  Perhaps it will loosen over time.  Magnification is perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> My wife was looking all over for a wall mounted makeup mirror that was chrome and magnified from 8x to 10x.  I bought 2 other mirrors from box stores that I had to return before she found this one.  Most mirrors I was finding magnified either 3x which wasn&#x27;t enough or 15x which was too much.  This one was the happy medium that finally stopped the makeup mirror hunt.&lt;br /&gt;This mirror doesn&#x27;t really have any extra frills.  No light, which we don&#x27;t need and certainly isn&#x27;t oversided, but it is perfect for her needs.  The wall mounting was quick and easy.  A drill and the include hardware was all that I needed to get it mounted.  It took a total of about 5-8 minutes and it was up and ready to use.  The swivel is smooth and the mirror moves vertically so that you can change the angle depending on your needs.  Overall, this was a great purchase.</li>
            <li> Very easy to install. Hope it last for years to come</li>
            <li> This mirror was such a good purchase. It was very easy to wall mount and all the hardware required was included. I actually have two of these. The first one was bought years ago and is still used daily. I wanted a second mirror for my guest bathroom, so this one won&#x27;t be used as often, but I&#x27;m sure my guests will appreciate it. The magnification is just the perfect amount for makeup and beauty applications. Having the magnifying mirror on a swivel arm is so helpful, because you can put it at whatever angle works for you. Excellent mirror for an excellent price.</li>
            <li> I use this product twice a day and am very happy with it. It mounted well, feels substantial, expands and pivots but also goes back flat against the wall. The magnification is accurate and higher power than mirrors I frequently encounter in hotels.</li>
            <li> the magnification is great and the other side is normal.  good product that works well when applying make up or facial products</li>
            <li> This is perfect for fast morning makeup application and then fold up and go!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting a mirror similar to the ones I&#x27;ve seen mounted in hotel room bathrooms. My bathroom is small, so I needed a mirror that would mount securely to the wall. I&#x27;ve used this mirror daily for several months now. I swing it out fully and flip the two sides of the middle back and forth often and it has stayed secure. My husband mounted the mirror into a stud.</li>
            <li> This is just as described and one side magnifies more than the other. It has been on my wall for 6 months</li>
            <li> Easy to mount on wall; very sturdy.  8x magnification is plenty;  almost too much ;-)  Nice chrome finish.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a great mirror to have in the bathroom! I had a irritating cinder that blew into my eye and the magnifying&lt;br /&gt;of the mirror let me see it clearly and remove it with a Q-tip. It flexes to accommodate any situation.&lt;br /&gt;Just be sure to measure and locate the mirror before attaching it to the wall.</li>
            <li> This is a nicely made, easy to use mirror.  My only complaint is that I should have gotten a 10x if they sell one.  If your vision is at all limited in any way (e.g. wear glasses), 10x is so much better.  I have a 10x hand mirror that I had been using and I didn&#x27;t realize how much of a decrease it would be to go to 8x.</li>
            <li> Glad I choose this mirror. It is a good size and can be easily moved to positions needed. Magnification is spot on for me.</li>
            <li> I saw a similar mirror in a hotel while staying and it was great to have hands free magnification.  We installed this in our bathroom and it is a great mirror.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This mounted well, has good optics, moves nicely through it&#x27;s extents... it&#x27;s a very nice mirror.  Once you get used to one of these, you can never do without one again.  My only small regret was not getting one with a light built into it.  But other than that, this baby works great.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what my wife was looking for. She used one at a hotel and fell in love with it. She has always used a free standing makeup mirror and found this one much easier. It shipped in Two days!</li>
            <li> These were Christmas gifts for my mom and aunt and they loved them! Maybe too much since now they obsess over their pores for creepy long periods of time.</li>
            <li> Excellent product with easy installation.  Performs well in small areas. Perfect for what I was looking for.  Recommend for everyone.</li>
            <li> When staying at a high-end hotel in FL, I enjoyed a mirror such as this.  Had to have one for my own.  This magnifying mirror is wonderful !!  Applying make-up, especially to my eyes, had become difficult, due to the fact that I need glasses to see up close.  With this mirror, I can see everything so clear!!!  It really is amazing how much I didn&#x27;t see before!  I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> This mirror is of excellent quality and does what it is supposed to.  Makes make-up application a snap.  The first one was perfect so I ordered a second one.  The second one was a little stiff to swivel but that was easily taken care of by a little WD 40.</li>
            <li> I chose this mirror after reading of difficulties with many illuminated mirrors that have the bulbs blow out.  This is lovely!  I just want to say, all the Amazon reviewers here are correct about the need to pick up decent anchors other than what is provided.  I made a trek to the hardware store and the guy who worked there was a bit snarky about putting much faith in Amazon reviewers and told me the anchors that this came with would work just fine.  Well, guess what?  Amazon reviewers were right, hardware store man WRONG.  So other than having to do the job twice that I wanted to do once, it&#x27;s a great item.</li>
            <li> I have neck and upper back pain.  When putting on makeup, I found myself leaning towards the mirror located over the sink, and it caused pain.  With this mirror, I am able to put on makeup, pluck eyebrows, etc. without leaning forward and with no pain!</li>
            <li> Great size and good quality</li>
            <li> I do love it and wish I would have bought one sooner. However it feels a little flimsy and not sure how long it will last.</li>
            <li> The arm and swivel allows for people of varying heights to use the mirror.  The magnification is strong and you have to get fairly close to the mirror for it to be clear (not distorted) but it is great for plucking eyebrows and getting your eyeliner just right.</li>
            <li> Nice mirror. Looks great and seems well made. Magnification is just right for applying makeup. This is a very good deal for the money.</li>
            <li> Have used this mirror for about a month now and am very happy with it...  Easy to mount and very solid... Nice clear view on both sides.</li>
            <li> Works great, easy to install.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but I wish it had a light.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really wanna to explain why I&#x27;ve chosen this item. Just like it. Very strange from my point of view to force to complete reviews...</li>
            <li> Very high magnifying! But we like it and very nice in our bathroom.</li>
            <li> This wall mount mirror is just what I&#x27;ve been looking for. It is hotel quality, nice and sturdy, great MAGNIFICATION. I researched all sorts, I feel that the eight times magnifier really does the job for putting on makeup to perfection! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is just like one I previously purchased from Bed, Bath,and Beyond except that one was 5X magnification.  If you really need assistance with seeing things closely, this fits the bill.  My husband prefers the 5X for shaving but I love this for eye makeup.</li>
            <li> Excellent mirror. Great for applying makeup. It arrived quickly and was easy to install. I use it everyday.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This was an open box for about half the normal price. All parts were there and my wife loves it!</li>
            <li> so wonderful to see what i am doing early in the morning!  easy install! lies flat and out of the way</li>
            <li> The 10X magnification is what my wife.  It is crystal clear with no defects on either side.  The chrome is deep and rich and the arms work perfectly.  She loves it.  Now from the mechanical side:One of elbows was frozen upon arrival,  A 16th of a turn of the bottom screw adjustment with a screwdriver took care of that in seconds.  There&#x27;s a reason people have a difficult time mounting the unit.  The two plastic mounting expanders just don&#x27;t work.  They will loosen-up quickly because they are badly engineered and should be tossed.  Get two decent ones from the hardware store and the fixture will be mounted rock solid.</li>
            <li> Although a little oil was needed to lubricate the joints this mag mirror is very high quality at a very surprising low price. The cover plate which hides the screws makes installation and removal easy and professional. I had to re-position one of the mirrors (we purchased two) a couple of times to get the height practical. The swivel and long arm length extends the mirror almost to any position needed. Not often a product meets all ones expectations!</li>
            <li> We made the right choice, this mirror looks very simple and elegant. We were hesitant between this mirror and the one that lights up, but the light on the other one is too low and the price so not worth it. We are very happy with this mirror and highly recommend it. Really good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for years for one like this. I&#x27;m tall trying to use one that sets on a table top which is a pain. But now this makes it easy to handle all those two handed jobs and stand up straight.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because my daughter has one and my wife  commented several times how much she enjoyed that mirror being mounted on the wall.  I appears to be well built, with good chrome on the surfaces.  The mirrors are very clear, with no blurring around the edges.  I would recommend using toggle bolts to attach the mounting bracket to the wall, as repeated use of the swing arm will soon loosen the typical wall anchors included with the mirror.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.  Just had it installed and it looks great and functions great as well.  Fast delivery, good quality.</li>
            <li> It is a great looking, nice product and easy installation.</li>
            <li> I would reccomend this to everyone. If you are a very picky person about what your hair looks like on the back of your head, then this is the problem solver.... I wear colored hair extenions on the back of my head and I want it to look great from the back of my head as it does from the front.. Plus, the magnifyed mirror helps me with tiny close up things such as make up, etc. The mirror tilts up or down, so you can see from the top of your head to down below if you have long hair like I do. I have my mirror anchored on the wall, where I can actually be in the shower also while exfoliating my face using this mirror, and it gets no contact with water from the shower. This mirror is very adjustable, Thanks again, I love it.... How did I ever get along without it ?</li>
            <li> Great magnifying mirror and extension arm allows you to turn it in several directions.  Easy to install. Good value.  Maginfication is wonderful especially for applying make-up, tweezing, etc.</li>
            <li> Clear curve of the mirror over the entire surface. Much better than a handheld model. Nice chrome finish. Solid build, stays in position. Easy to use 2 part hanging hardware but it would be nice if some screwing hardware was included.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror. Although it is frightful to look at yourself 8x magnified. That is not the mirror&#x27;s fault. It is sturdy and well made. It doesn&#x27;t feel cheap at all. It was a great price and met all my expectations. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this after staying in a very nice hotel in san diego that had a similar one and my wife loved it.  Fast shipment and easy mount.</li>
            <li> exactly as advertised.love it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to get one of these. I like them when I travel and a hotel has one in the bathroom. It just never occurred to me that perhaps I should get one for home. Works great. I used extra sturdy wall inserts to screw into. I didn&#x27;t want it falling off.</li>
            <li> Mirror is great for finding those lost contacts in your eyes, or applying makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pivot on the wall made noise as the arm was moved until we applied WD-40.</li>
            <li> I screwed this mirror into a wall stud for stability.  It moves very easily and since I&#x27;m short I placed it at a good height.  The 8X magnification is just perfect.  This is the easiest I have ever had it since I started wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife who&#x27;s over 40 eyes were starting to be a problem. Works well seems installed it a few days ago and she loves it.</li>
            <li> We took a cruise and really liked having the magnified Wall Mount mirror in the cabin. I made a mental note to purchase one for a Christmas stocking stuffer. So I looked on Amazon and found this one and it was priced very competitively. I was not sure what magnification to get and could have used less that an 8X, probably would get a 5X or so next time. How do you know until you use it. It is kind of a trial and error thing I guess. Conclusion: I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased a 10x from a bedding store and could not  see without distortion ( too powerful). 8x is perfect for those of us middle ager&#x27;s who can&#x27;t see to put on our makeup</li>
            <li> My eyesight has deteriorated over the past few years to the point that I can not longer use my 5X mirror to see close up. I can see again with this mirror (the good and the bad). I saw this in a hotel and had to have it. The best part is the wall mount. I can see much better to put contact lenses in, tweezing, etc. The regular strength mirror on the backside can be used to see the sides and back of your head when styling your hair. I love this mirror! If you are getting a little older and your eyes just aren&#x27;t quite like they used to be, you too will love this product!</li>
            <li> I like the amount of magnification this mirror provides for my old eyes.  I have it mounted in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I had seen a swivel mirror like this in a hotel in south Florida.  Was so happy to have found it on Amazon.  My husband uses it as much as I do!</li>
            <li> Perfect! Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Great mirror just what I needed.</li>
            <li> Good but if you can buy the one with a light.  It will be much better I think.</li>
            <li> After loosening the hinges just a bit, works well.  Quality isn&#x27;t bad, but the anchors that came with it didn&#x27;t seem substantial enough.  Screwed it directly into the wood because we thought in time it would pull out of the drywall, even with better anchors. The magnification is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> great sturdy mirror that I should have bought years ago since I need reading glasses to see close!!</li>
            <li> It requires a drill and screwdriver, of course, and I had to use different wall anchors from the ones what came with the mirror.  Still, it went up easily.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror. It has the perfect magnification.  I had a 10x and I felt like I was going cross-eyed trying to focus. This one is perfect. I see every hair when I tweeze and can do my eyes perfectly without wearing my glasses.  I set it up by my bathroom mirror and the lights I have above my sink iluminate my mirror plenty. I don&#x27;t feel like I need the lighted mirror, which would be very bulky, making it difficult to fold flush against the wall. It feels very sturdy. My husband put better anchors in the wall than what it came with and I have had no problem at all.</li>
            <li> it worked out great. my wife is happy.</li>
            <li> So easy to see and style the back of my hair,.plus the bigger side is excellent for putting on my makeup and tweezing my eyebrows!!! Highly recommend this mirror to all who needs a lil help with seeing back of head n applying makeup.:)</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to put on make up without glasses, good size and adequate magnification , nice design and fits against wall.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror. I hung it myself while my husband was out of town. No problem whatsoever. The only thing I wish, because I&#x27;m middle-aged, is that the magnification was a little stronger. It says it is an 8. I would have liked a little more. ha</li>
            <li> Has great magnification, but you have to be in the right light.  However, that is not the product&#x27;s fault!</li>
            <li> Just what I needed.  Worked perfect</li>
            <li> sturdy. mounts easily.</li>
            <li> After shopping around for a mirror of this type, this mirror delivers at an affordable price. Seems sturdy, very functional, &amp; was fairly easy to install. Finish is nice, well-made overall.</li>
            <li> A great addition to our remodeled bathroom. I set it for my height, making it good for putting on makeup for someone who cannot see well without her glass.</li>
            <li> I would think  &amp; expect that for a unit like this there would have been included screws &amp; anchors for mounting on the wall. The directions show screws &amp; anchors in the mounting diagram, but are no where to be found. If they had been included it would have improved my star rating.</li>
            <li> Love this mirror, much easier to apply my makeup.</li>
            <li> this mirror is just what I have been looking for the past year - how did I manage without it?</li>
