            <li> [[ASIN:B000BF1FRQ Sensi-Care Protective Barrier Cream - 4 Oz Tube - Each]]  I have had  J-Tube for 15 years and this barrier cream is the most effective in caring for the condition of the skin around the tube site.  I would not even consider changing products since I found this one.  The Doctors at University Hospital in Ann Arbor Michigan introduced me to this product.  Please pass my appreciaton along to the manufacturers.  G. Stevens, Flint Mi</li>
            <li> My son was in the NICU for a week when he was born.  When they put him on formula (versus donor milk) he had a bad reaction (diarrhea) that left his little bottom raw and sore.  The hospital used this on him and it cleared it right up.  It is thick so it won&#x27;t rub on on the diaper and protects from wetness.  It also has an ingredient that helps heal diaper rash faster.  Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> best diaper cream for serious rashes!</li>
            <li> Not quite what I wanted, but it worked. My fault.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended  by a nurse in the hospital when our son got diaper rash as a newborn. It is VERY thick, but that provides the coverage needed to protect the skin and allow it to heal. I have recommended this product to everyone with babies and have only received positive feedback.</li>

            <li> My wife uses it to sooth burns from radiation. This is the only product that gives her relief. Number 3  is the only one that works. #2 does not work.</li>
            <li> This is the best barrier cream on the market!  I&#x27;ve been using it for a while now and it really makes a difference.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have never written a review, but this stuff is so amazing, I had to write this one.  My 6 week old daughter had a diaper rash that Desitin, A&amp;D Ointment, Triple Paste, or Calmoseptine could not clear up.  A friend told me about this and that he was given it for his daughter when she was in the NICU.  Willing to try anything, I ordered it.  After just a couple of uses, I could see major improvement and her diaper rash is finally cleared up after almost three weeks!  An added bonus is it is unscented and doesn&#x27;t have the medicinal smell that other creams have.  If you purchase this, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding cream, I have used it for several years. It allows rashes and other irrititants to clear up in no time. I would NOT be without it !!!</li>

            <li> I have used ( or made, as did many ICU nurses) a variety of barrier creams to prevent incontinence skin burns and to diminish pressure sore breakdowns on the butt:  tnis is the best ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy it, apply a nice, not too thick coat and it will prevent discharges from penetrating to the skin. When you clean, just wipe off the surface material and NOT all the cream down to the skin.  The cteam hardens somewhat and forms a protective shell until any irritated or broken skin heals and pushes it off from underneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin care nurse specialists are amazed that i have prevented butt skin breakdown on a bedbound patient for almost 2 years now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this for my baby girl&#x27;s diaper rash. It&#x27;s the only thing that really works and isn&#x27;t irritating to her skin. Clears up her rawest rashes in no time :)</li>
