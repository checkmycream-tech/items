            <li>This will not burn your skin, which is great!</li>
            <li>This was the BEST thing ever.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have stockpiled like 20 of them or something because it was that great!</li>
            <li>This addresses both of those points wonderfully.</li>
            <li>One of the best lower-priced acne remedies I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks and have been very happy!</li>
            <li>For anyone ages 12-25, this product is the best thing for night time acne treatment.</li>

            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it causes me to break out (which is a good thing!)</li>
            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>It feels good on your skin, helps to balance any redness, and it&#x27;s a perfect makeup primer.</li>
            <li>I always had beautiful skin before that.</li>
            <li>Going from beautiful skin to acne is hearbreaking but through the years you become an expert because you&#x27;ve tried almost everything thing from presciptions, over the counter, and even products from Mexico.</li>
            <li>very pleased really excellent product I can recommend it met my expectations</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I found something that works on my acne.</li>
            <li>But the product is GREAT.</li>
            <li>some people say it worked great for them, but not for me.</li>

            <li>This is so great.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Great Product.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m incredibly happy with the product.</li>
            <li>Great at clearing up the face.</li>
            <li>and everyone thinks I have great skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I decided to stick through this treatment since I already paid for it, and I&#x27;m happy to say that I made that</li>
            <li>but i wont be happy</li>
            <li>I am happy to report that this product works, and works well.</li>
            <li>it is a great product!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is hydrating and weightless and has worked great for me with the use of the rest of the line.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this product!!</li>
            <li>Love this acne treatment, just wish I could buy it in the stores!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this for a more affordable BHA exfoliant!!</li>
            <li>Very effective results.  </li>
            <li>and I must say it has been very effective.</li>
            <li>I use it in morning after bath and in the evening after washing my face and it does work... very effective.</li>
            <li>Also to the smell is amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s reduced my outbreaks by around 90%, which is a remarkable improvement.</li>
            <li>and it remains effective for upto 7 hours!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many things over the years, and have found my perfect treatment.  </li>
            <li>Best product I&#x27;ve ever used better than pro-active, and does not leave your face oily.</li>
            <li>so I was thrilled to see I could get it on amazon prime!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t ned to apply a lot of product, it hydrates your face really nice!</li>
            <li>As said this product is amazing and I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li>This is really good stuff, don&#x27;t understand why Neutrogena no longer makes it</li>
            <li>but I see where those in my age range (50s) and women with menopausal acne have good results.  </li>
            <li>It was shipped in good time, and arrived in good shape.    </li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t seem to be good for cystic hormonal breakouts.</li>
            <li>my skin feels good after using this product, help with the acne, and hydrating all the time~</li>
            <li>the price is good too</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m feeling as good about myself as I have since</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t so it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works well, and a good value since it comes in a 2 oz tube.</li>
            <li>Also, the price is really good.</li>
            <li>good for acne stress control</li>
            <li>I gave this stuff a good try</li>
            <li>For the price, I think it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a good product to try if you struggle with acne, just be patient.</li>
            <li>It would be a good every day acne preventative</li>
            <li>This is good for fading spots that a pimple leaves though</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s good for us.</li>
            <li>So this is a really good deal...</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it is so good</li>
            <li>I read a lot of good reviews</li>
            <li>It didnt break my face out so thats good.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter-in-law at Christmas after hearing her complain about her acne and reading what looked to be good reviews on this product.</li>
            <li>Wish I could say something good about it</li>
            <li>and I will be super happy!</li>
            <li>You will love your beautiful looking skin with this product!!!!!  :-)</li>
            <li>I love this acne gel, it is my very favorite!</li>
            <li>Helped tremendously!!!</li>
            <li>WIth this product, my face looks very healthy and even.</li>
            <li>The formula is moisturizing and smells good, which I liked.  </li>
            <li>I was pretty impressed.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Non-irritating, clears acne, reduces redness, and makes your face feel smooth !!</li>
            <li>I love this product and can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s been discontinued!</li>
            <li>I will definitely by more!</li>
            <li>My skin is so much better!  </li>
            <li>May not be suitable for everyone but good product.  </li>
            <li>After using this more acne started to appear!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>My pimples started going away (my face looks so much better!)</li>
            <li>Saved my life more than once !</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s truly amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, shrinking my breakouts 70% overnight.   </li>
            <li>Oil free stress control 3-n-1 is great for me.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because of its amazing review.</li>
            <li>But the Neutrogena Oil Free Ance Stress Control is great, because it moisturizes my face without it looking greasy throughout the day; and at night I use a &amp;#34;heavier&amp;#34; moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be amazing</li>
            <li>I tried this product and really liked it.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s not a kit, you can just buy what you need and when so that is nice too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Docked 1 star because the product does not seem to help with minimizing breakouts or reducing the severity or duration of breakouts, which is kind of its purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On that note, I have to say that the product doesn&#x27;t seem to be all that effective at diminishing scars, marks, and hyperpigmentation as a result of acne.</li>
            <li>it is kind of hit or miss</li>
            <li>I really liked that it was moisturizing,</li>
            <li>Kind of like I remember when I was a teenager and slathered benzyl peroxide all over my face.</li>
            <li>I am kind of nervous that I never see this in the store.</li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t seem to be effectively treating the acne I already had before I started using it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was kind of hesitant about this product when I saw that it was Neutrogena.</li>
            <li>I know some people probably aren&#x27;t a fan of it, but it smells kind of minty to me.</li>
            <li>and now I have flawless, glowing skin thanks to Neutrogena.</li>
            <li>But now I am setting up my own kids with this system.</li>
            <li>and this kind of just feels like a gel.  </li>
            <li>Acne Stress control has the appropriate amount of salicylic acid, along with the right pH for best exfoliation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But pretty much, it&#x27;s awesome, like magic and probably discontinued because Neutrogena doesn&#x27;t bet on the winners.</li>
            <li>In my experience, it works best at preventing new acne</li>
            <li>I still have to use a dot of light moisturizer around my lips, but this is a great formula that will leave your skin hydrated AND protected :)</li>
            <li>Has a great feeling to it and even has a great natural smell.</li>
            <li>and it has a nice smell whereas most acne products stink.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best acne moisturizer I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>This is the best hydrating acne treatment I have used so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a great product and definitely worth the $12 dollars.</li>
            <li>love love love this!</li>
            <li>the product is great for your face works good, and is a good price as well you can see the change as long as you go buy the instructions.</li>
            <li>natural smell and very pleasant as well.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pretty happy about that.  </li>
            <li>For the first year, Proactiv worked great even if it had a not-so-great price tag.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a very light liquid.</li>
            <li>At first I used it morning and night and experienced no adverse effects, and when I didn&#x27;t break out any more</li>
            <li>I loved this stuff so much!!  </li>
            <li>AND it controls my oily skin which is another huge bonus!</li>
            <li>This stuff works wonders on my acne and doesnt make me me more sun-sensitive.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>Most of my breakouts though are hormonal.</li>
            <li>After about a week of use, most of my acne has cleared up.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it wouldn&#x27;t work well for everyone -</li>
            <li>(Most preparations are solutions rather than emulsions or suspensions, and thus alcohol is required to dissolve the salicylic acid, which is not water soluble.)    </li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re okay with using these things, go for it.</li>
            <li>It helps but isn&#x27;t as drying as most of these types of acne creams are.....</li>
            <li>This product worked way quicker and better than any others I tried, including Proactive.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who looks for something lightweight, feels great and wants to keep pimples from popping up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite BHA product for a number of reasons.</li>
            <li>The formulation is actually great - very lightweight, almost like a serum; it feels like nothing on your skin.  </li>
            <li>but this stuff really works to keep my face looking great.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s one more product at this point, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are suffering from acne, most experts will tell you the wash isn&#x27;t where you need your Benzoyl Peroxide or Salicylic Acid, it&#x27;s your toner and moisturizer where you need your acne treatment.</li>
            <li>and I am in love with it.</li>
            <li>I sincerely hope that Neutrogena is listening.</li>
            <li>Best of all, it is totally invisible after it is applied.</li>
            <li>more acne started to appear after using if for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I used a doctor recommended moisturizer but that resulted in more breakouts.</li>
            <li>I like it better than prescribed medications from my doctor.</li>
            <li>I bought this produce mostly to minimize my pores on my nose, which it did not do.</li>
            <li>I love Neutrogena products.</li>
            <li>This stuff is just ok.</li>
            <li>Like many people who suffered from acne since childhood, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of anti-acne products out there.  </li>
            <li>works like magic.  </li>
            <li>Smells ok.</li>
            <li>when I stop using it, that&#x27;s when more acne comes.</li>
            <li>then it sure wont work for severe acne.</li>
            <li>I have tried many treatments and combinations of products.</li>
            <li>, but I was hoping for something more.  </li>
            <li>She has tried a lot of products and this one has worked better then any of the others.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love the smothness and softness I get from this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Seems alright.&lt;br /&gt;Not magic</li>
            <li>after seeing this product on Amazon and reading reviews I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had tried many acne creams but did not found anything like this.</li>
            <li>I still think the charcoal soaps work better</li>
            <li>My breakouts are almost gone, and skin feels much better.  </li>
            <li>There are so many things I love about this product.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough about how wonderful it</li>
            <li>Perfect light weight summer moisturizer for sensitive skin that is prone to break outs.  </li>
            <li>Trust me try it and you will love it</li>
            <li>Plus for the cheap price, there isn&#x27;t a risk!</li>
            <li>I have breakouts on my forehead mostly.</li>
            <li>I bought this after I received a facial and the facialist explained that my pores needed exfoliation but that scrubs probably weren&#x27;t the best idea for my reactive skin.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell, too.  </li>
            <li>I mostly \\&quot;outgrew\\&quot;</li>
            <li>My face is now more appealing and my acne has practically vanished.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found anything better, and frankly have no desire to switch to anything else at this point because I am quite satisfied.</li>
            <li>Absoultely love...just ordered more.</li>
            <li>Again I love this product....</li>
            <li>Been using it for 5 months now, worked better for me than Proactive, so had to write something.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using the $38 per 1 ounce \\&quot;ClearPrep FX Matte Foundation Primer and Anti-Acne Treatment\\&quot; from Sephora, which I LOVE, yet...</li>
            <li>It is amazing and leaves my skin feeling smooth and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Much better than on here</li>
            <li>get lever 200 soap or dial soap to wach your acne face better...</li>
            <li>It would be excellent if supplemented with an occasional BHA peel! :)</li>
            <li>the span of the two most stressful weeks at work and planning my wedding during my \\&quot;time off,\\</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s literally the most moisturizing product EVER.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s like putting water on my face (in the best way possible).</li>
            <li>But I can say my skin just FEELS better.</li>
            <li>and I can tell you that this works better than anything they sell, and for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>Murad costs about 5 times more, however.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>would recommend this :) .</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>but I think it works on most.</li>
            <li>best face lotion for oily skin point blank period.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and seems to work very well.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s more of a post-cleansing and moisturizing</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product, but you don&#x27;t want to turn your face shiny and oily, right?</li>
            <li>THANKS NEUTROGENA!!!!</li>
            <li>It really works!!!!</li>
            <li>I do love the consistency and smell and it is pretty good at keeping skin moisturized too,</li>
            <li>It also has a nice, mild scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of mild in my opinion, sort of cucumber-ish</li>
            <li>But I have super oily skin, so it might not work for those you with nice sensitve</li>
            <li>clear your acne ,this one works ,and  very light very nice smell</li>
            <li>This product works best when you use it every single night.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is alcohol free but its a very light exfoliating gel....</li>
            <li>VERY light, smooth, and does not have a strong odor.</li>
            <li>Make sure to use foundation or some light sunscreen with it as it doesn&#x27;t have the SPF.</li>
            <li>Please make this product more available.</li>
            <li>I paired this with Cetaphil&#x27;s Gentle Skin Cleaner and my skin has NEVER looked this good.</li>
            <li>This gel goes on light and smells good - not too strong just a light fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>I use this right before bed on alternating nights and skip the moisturizer because this provides a nice moist feeling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It absorbs to the skin very quickly.  </li>
            <li>this stuff makes my life easy.</li>
            <li>I have found over the years that some of the best options for clear, healthy skin can be found for cheap in your own kitchen, at your local drugstore, and of course, on Amazon.</li>
            <li>All of the Neutrogena 3-in1 products are quality made and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good combo and decent price.</li>
            <li>This is pretty amazing considering I have had to have my dermatologist</li>
            <li>I first purchased this product in January because of all the amazing reviews I had read about it.</li>
            <li>I love the cool feeling and the smell it has</li>
            <li>Okay, one full cycle.  </li>
            <li>Hands down the best acne product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>There are two fine steps to take.  </li>
            <li>Over all the most AMAZING acne vanishing product (better than proactive or clean and clear).</li>
            <li>very light yet just the right touch of moisture.</li>
            <li>that really matters is that this amazing acne treatment has returned to being available.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a month and it made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Make-up goes on smooth over it.  </li>
            <li>This stuff glide on smooth.</li>
            <li>The scent is light.</li>
            <li>so I lightly apply it to my problem areas in the morning after washing my face.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, though Amazon tends to have the lowest price.  </li>
            <li>This is a fabulous product that appears to no longer be available…anywhere???</li>
            <li>Of course, as I said before, stress and diet control is equally important.</li>
            <li>I think its really fit to my skin, as she recommended.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, it does not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li>(I have combination) and the scent is light and pleasing.  </li>
            <li>This helped the pore to be smaller and I am happy about that.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s done a great job in keeping my face relatively acne-free.  </li>
            <li>So happy I found this product after it seemed to be discontinued in all the my local stores.</li>
            <li>B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System, 0.68-Fluid Ounce]]</li>
            <li>These things along with the Neutrogena Oil Free Acnee Stress Control 3-in-1</li>
            <li>this is such a great product.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>I will say that this product is no longer available in stores and the expiration date is this December</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who has acne products and is looking for an amazing treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels hydrated and really smooth.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena Oil Free Moisture SPF 35, 2.5  Ounce]].</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a product that feels good on your skin, is gentle, smells nice and helps clear up break outs</li>
            <li>thanks for offering such a great service!</li>
            <li>So glad amazon brought this back, this really is a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a gentle, daily BHA, this is one of the best formulations around.  </li>
            <li>so I guess for her it is doing a good enough job or better than anything else she has tried.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell, doesnt dryout your skin, and instead leavesyour skin feeling cool and clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I am not blemish free but my face looks pretty darn good thanks to this stuff.</li>
            <li>I used this consistently with the Stress Control face wash for about 2 weeks and for some reason I was getting more acne that I had before.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I&#x27;ve seen significant improvement with his skin compared to 2 years ago.</li>
            <li>So far I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>B000GCQ04C Dickinson&#x27;s Original Witch Hazel Pore</li>
            <li>I was excited when I read others reviews about this product.</li>
            <li>this product doesn&#x27;t seem to be available locally at this point, so I tried Amazon and was thrilled to be able to get it sent out automatically every couple of months.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure the smell just tricks me into thinking the treatment is working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first your skin may break out more as it &amp;#34;boils&amp;#34; all the acne to the surface.</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t happy with how long it took for the product to work</li>
            <li>Seems to work pretty well for most acne spots.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of different products and this one is the best by far.</li>
            <li>But after I used it, it made my skin broke-out although it is oil-free and clean.</li>
            <li>addition, a really effective (and cheap) way to keep your pores and skin clear is something you may already have in your kitchen cupboards...</li>
            <li>Nothing will stop the flow of oil (which keeps me looking much younger than my 60 years), but I highly recommend this product as something that does as good a job as anything else and treats my skin kindly.</li>
            <li>I bought this along with the Neutrogena Complete Acne System and they have both made my skin better in just 2 weeks!</li>
            <li>Foods Jojoba Oil Pure, 4 ounce]] for keeping my skin soft without breaking it out (please see my review on that amazing stuff)!</li>
            <li>would recommend it very highly to anyone for sure</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and is absorbed into the skin, leaving no stickiness or shine.</li>
            <li>I also tried various pills that had good feedback from acne sufferers.</li>
            <li>ok for combination skin but doesn&#x27;t help the blackheads on my oily nose where I really needed the salicylic acid to work.</li>
            <li>Well worth the cheap price.</li>
            <li>but overall it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving it so far.</li>
            <li>Then later I found good price on Neutrogena website.</li>
            <li>Thanks to many acne forums, I found that if you mix 50% \\&quot;Monistat Soothing Care</li>
            <li>Makes acne fade away, redness goes away and keeps skin full with moisture.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products and none have worked as well and gently as this product.  </li>
            <li>This oil free line from Neutrogena is great and costs less than the olay kit.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does a great job of keeping your skin clear and very soft.</li>
            <li>I have used the Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Stress Control product for several years now and absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>The other Murad item that is a great spot treatment is the Sulphur cream.</li>
            <li>more than it hurts but didn&#x27;t give me any huge difference as far as hydration or acne</li>
            <li>When I get a bump it decreases the redness and heals it quick.  </li>
            <li>Service ws quick and came undamaged because it was well-packed.</li>
            <li>Remember different skin types respond to different treatments, so search until you find what works best for you.  </li>
            <li>If it didn&#x27;t work for my mild acne</li>
            <li>I still think control stress and diet is the most important thing to deal with adult acnes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also bought him another bottle of Origin super spot remover and acne treatment gel which is around 15 dollars on origin website.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and mild acne.  </li>
            <li>and it gone quick</li>
            <li>It absorbs into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li>I hope this product appears back in stores sometime soon, so many people love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice packaging and consistency of the actual product was light and cooling.</li>
            <li>I bought this to be used as a mild chemical exfoliant for my aging, yet still combination/acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>Now I can&#x27;t even see my pores in my lighted 10x magnification mirror, and it has greatly reduced the slight redness I had around my nose and on my chin.  </li>
            <li>Hydrating Acne Treatment have helped me quite alot in keeping my skin much clearer more consistently than without</li>
            <li>which is a real bummer!!  </li>
            <li>Now they are still kind of there, but a lot less prominent and</li>
            <li>This is just like every other acne treatment you have tried.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing particularly special or good about it.</li>
            <li>My face now looks relatively clean now, and people around me really noticed the change!</li>
            <li>I have found over the years that some of the best options for clear, healthy skin can be found for cheap in your own kitchen, at your local drugstore, and of course, on Amazon.nsistency (thicker than if you were preparing it to eat) then let it cool enough to safely rub on your face, (you will have gross chunks of oatmeal hanging, but trust me, this is worth it) and let dry for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Most of the time it is hard to find good price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Spent so much money trying to find the best face wash to clear up my unwanted zits.</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s ideal for people in their teens to late thirties.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week and my skin just looks amazing.</li>
            <li>Goes on light with no irritating ingredients...just does what it is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need much, so looks like it will last me a good while.  </li>
            <li>I have tried dozens of products, supplements and diets without success.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had success with.  </li>
            <li>And It helps clear up acne quickly!!(2-3 days at most)</li>
            <li>I used the Neutrogena Rapid Clear product line for quite some time, and have always been pleased with it.</li>
            <li>However, this product has broken the pattern and provided EXCELLENT acne prevention without over-drying.</li>
            <li>I have to use it 3 times a day to keep my skin without oil but its worth it.</li>
            <li>Well worth it</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it all the time because I have since switched to more natural products, but my skin did respond well to it</li>
            <li>I have had acne since elementary school, and I&#x27;m now 29.  </li>
            <li>My daughter being using this product for a week and her face looks clear she looks Moore confident now.</li>
            <li>I thought this product had been discontinued, but I&#x27;m thrilled to see that it&#x27;s back in stock!</li>
            <li>I expect Neutrogena 3-in-1 hydrating acne treatment  will be discontinued because it is a better value than the Rapid Clear Acne Defense Face Lotion.</li>
            <li>The reason I decided to switch to using japanese skin products is because their skin care products are much more advanced than ours here in the staes.</li>
            <li>Wash your face well, make sure your facial surface is clean, and put these on and it will take care of the rest.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My zits are gone and my acne is disappearing right before my eyes.</li>
            <li>I tend to use this either when I&#x27;m home all day during the weekend or right before bed.</li>
            <li>I can use this at night and not worry about having to put on a moisturizer on my face right after applying the treatment.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right, an oatmeal mask.</li>
            <li>I ordered it right away.  </li>
            <li>Over the last year I&#x27;d developed a fairly persistent case of mild acne.</li>
            <li>This product does a decent job of clearing my skin up and keeping me oil free.  </li>
            <li>but when I went to walmarts website to buy more I found out it is apparently out of stock online.  </li>
            <li>The only good thing about this item is how soft it makes your skin.</li>
            <li>Before buying this product I was using proactiv for $45 each month and this item is just as good for a lot less.</li>
            <li>I have had visibly better skin, and it does not dry my skin out</li>
            <li>This is the only acne treatment that I use because it&#x27;s gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>Benzoyl Peroxide for whatever reason just doesn&#x27;t seem to like my skin very much.</li>
            <li>Price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>have very light occasional acne/dry skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use very much product</li>
            <li>If you wear foundation/makeup daily as I do, it is very important to have a barrier between your skin and the foundation, as there&#x27;s all kinds of \\&quot;goodies\\&quot; in the foundation that can add to skin irritation and breakouts.</li>
            <li>a great product for someone a little older (like me) who still has issues with blemishes, but needs some moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that it did the absolute best job on keeping my acne away, but just making it less red is an achievement in itself with my skin.     </li>
            <li>and I have used it on new pimples with good results - it doesn&#x27;t over dry or irritate my skin around the pimple.</li>
            <li>My very oily skin (which I am sure I&#x27;ll appreciate when I get older) has an uphill battle to stay blemish free and can become monster-bad if I am not very strict with water intake and many many other variables.  </li>
            <li>When I start to run out I will most definitely  come back and order some more.</li>
            <li>Even though I know that most topical products do nothing for hormonal acne, I thought this might help because of the words &amp;#34;stress control&amp;#34; in the name.</li>
            <li>In the last 3 days, I&#x27;ve been using this Neutrogena Hydrating Acne Treatment on my upper arms, and the difference is remarkable.</li>
            <li>I did experience some dryness for the first week, and just skip the benzyl peroxide if my skin is too irritated.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know what exactly it was.</li>
            <li>I first put it on my skin</li>
            <li>Every day I&#x27;ve waited for my acne to show back up and every day my face looks better than the day before.</li>
            <li>wash most mornings and every night before bed with OLAY FOAMING FACE WASH in the blue pump bottle.  </li>
            <li>I have only been using this product for a week, but the results have been stunning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with Acne for many years, now I&#x27;m in my mid 20s</li>
            <li>Thanks Neoutrogena!</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>The De La Cruz sulfur ointment that I ordered around the same time made a much more noticeable improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>Can be overly drying at times for your skin so don&#x27;t use too much but helps prevent/diminish breakouts!</li>
            <li>but if you suddenly get more pimples when you first try it, don&#x27;t get worried because that is suppose to happen so</li>
            <li>The only gripe I have is I wish it came in a flip top cap.  </li>
            <li>and I would buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>I began using this product several years ago, around the time when it was first put on the shelves, and have been using it for many years.</li>
            <li>Do this about 2 or so times a week, (although I recommend witch hazel daily for toning) and you will notice a difference I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>Do this about 2 or so times a week, (although I recommend witch hazel daily for toning) and you will notice a difference I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>Yes, I&#x27;m aware my skin problems are not solely the fault of this product...</li>
            <li>I love that this enables me to use only one.</li>
            <li>I never really felt like any of their products made a difference, you kind of just used it for the sake of putting something on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Be sure to use every night AFTER washing - daytime use is possible but it does not mix well with sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It does have a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; feel but not uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li>I bought japanese acne treatment and it works so much better.</li>
            <li>but I would switch back to this if they ever decide to make it again because I like the smell of this better than Aveeno&#x27;s formula.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved this product for a few years now.  </li>
            <li>B000052YJL Clean &amp; Clear Persa-Gel</li>
            <li>It really is the best thing out there and trumps pretty much all of Neutrogena&#x27;s other products (and perhaps all other mainstream acne treatment products, period).</li>
            <li>I can only hope this isn&#x27;t just a tease and that this is back for good.</li>
            <li>I decided to give this a try since it had a lot of positive reviews.</li>
            <li>(if you have oily skin, because pretty much, you want your skin to think it doesn&#x27;t need to produce oil, so you won&#x27;t have your problems, so you need to over-moisturize) step.</li>
            <li>I tried many different things to fix it with limited success, including products like Proactiv, Acne Free, and even the very highly reviewed &#x27;Regimen&#x27; from Acne.org.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually ordering the entire system when I get a chance, to see if it works best when used with the other products.</li>
            <li>I love love LOVE this product and only ordered it off Amazon once it went missing in local stores here&lt;</li>
            <li>My skin is SUPER sensitive to salicylic acid washes/creams.</li>
            <li>and I have lots of redness and flaky large pores.  </li>
            <li>: Neutrogena no longer sells this in this large tube.</li>
            <li>It would be great if it less harmful chemicals, hence only a 4 instead of 5 star review.</li>
            <li>I have mild acne, however when I used this it didn&#x27;t really clear much away</li>
            <li>The problem for most adults is we need to have a barrier that doesn&#x27;t dry out our skin, but doesn&#x27;t add too much moisturizer which contributes to blemishes.</li>
            <li>Not too drying for mature skin and still effective for mild to moderate, non-cystic acne of a teen.</li>
            <li>I use it primarily to keep my skin smooth and soft, which it does with only occasional use, but it also noticeably helps to prevent pimples and gets rid of milia quickly.</li>
            <li>I use this product as a spot treatment in the morning rather than to spread over my whole face, mostly because I&#x27;m prone to very dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Their people are known to be obsessed with skin care and are famous for their beautiful skin, so there is high demand over there for skin care products that actually works.</li>
            <li>However, I saw this similar product available at a much lower cost per ounce, so I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It helped to calm my skin and keep it clear</li>
            <li>if you have really stubborn acne you&#x27;ll probably want to get something else.</li>
            <li>was a real shocker.</li>
            <li>star - the product is reasonably priced&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get much moisture from this product, but it did reduce redness.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely amazed by the results of this product.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product really does hydrate your skin.  </li>
            <li>Much of this information I got from Paula&#x27;s Choice [...].</li>
            <li>The beta-hydroxy acid in this really works - it penetrates pores to really get the job done, but isn&#x27;t too drying .. or too oily.</li>
            <li>It leaves the affected skin feeling fresh and a bit tingly and preps that areas for completion of treatment with Neutrogena&#x27;s Rapid Clear.  </li>
            <li>This combination is working really well for me.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended !</li>
            <li>I figured it was time to really start looking into products to get rid of this stuff.</li>
            <li>I used this when I got out of the shower, after using the Neutrogena oil free acne wash, and had visible results the next morning.</li>
            <li>it all keeps my face clear, pours unclogged, face fresh and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is just too much for my skin or what</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have acne.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to eliminate the blackheads on my nose, it did absolutely nothing</li>
            <li>These bottles weren&#x27;t very helpful for me.</li>
            <li>a couple of weeks ago my face suddenly got filled with acne</li>
            <li>This product worked rather well on my very prone acne skin.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t help as much as I&#x27;d hoped it would.</li>
            <li>I was intensely embarrassed and didn&#x27;t want anyone to see me...</li>
            <li>Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser, For all skin types, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]]</li>
            <li>and I really like it a lot.  </li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>The pimple shrunk and most important, the pain is practically GONE, it usually takes about 3-5 days for the pain to completely disappear after one like that, but this time it went so much faster!  </li>
            <li>For me, this product does prevent acne and it really does hydrate your skin.</li>
            <li>then my skin would over compensate forthat and get really oily.</li>
            <li>I bought this for spot treatment and it works really well.  </li>
            <li>but it is very lingering so some people might not like that.</li>
            <li>It really has made quite a difference in the appearance of my skin.  </li>
            <li>It is really reduce stress for acne.</li>
            <li>This treatment works very well.</li>
            <li>cant really help me..</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t really get acne unless my period is coming</li>
            <li>This is disappearing from stores, but Neutroogena still sells it for a reasonable price on their site.</li>
            <li>Didnt really do much for me.</li>
            <li>It really hydrates your skin.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really do much to my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s incredibly gentle on your skin</li>
            <li>In addition to keeping my pores clear, this salicylic acid preparation has worked better than finacea (azelaic acid) at reducing my skin&#x27;s (especially my nose&#x27;s) redness, which is caused by rosacea.  </li>
            <li>My face is so clear, better than in years, and I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>Eh, it&#x27;s okay, but certainly no miracle.</li>
            <li>This stuff is just plain amazing.</li>
            <li>(the body lotion has the same ingredients as the \\&quot;special face\\&quot; lotion, but is much cheaper), and a gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li>I originally thought it was for younger people</li>
            <li>Additionally, the acne stress control lotion is the only salicylic acid preparation I could find that does not contain significant amounts of alcohol, which irritates my skin.</li>
            <li>It did seem to make any other lotion I put on top of it (moisturizer, sunscreen) seem \\&quot;tacky\\&quot; or \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; though.</li>
            <li>You will need to play with it to figure out how many times per day you should use it, for me it depends on what other products I am using on my face that day (sunscreen, makeup, moisturizers).</li>
            <li>I used it for about a month straight, mainly around my nose area to help get rid of my blackheads.</li>
            <li>As long as my stress level is medium it works fine.  </li>
            <li>I use it under my make-up and my break outs have pretty much gone completely away.</li>
            <li>It is refreshing, and soft on the dry skin and yet helps reduce breakouts and reduce the scars.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, it can still be found online via Amazon and other sites, including Neutrogena&#x27;s own website (where it&#x27;s actually slightly cheaper to buy than from the vendors who list it here on Amazon).</li>
            <li>Hydrating Acne Treatment\\&quot; then it will work as effectively as the ClearPrep primer (if not better), in that it prevents blemishes and shrink pores over time as well as the ClearPrep $38/oz for under $10/oz.  </li>
            <li>All you have to do is take about 1/3-1/2 cup of dry oatmeal, add very warm water to it to make a pretty thick consistency (thicker than if you were preparing it to eat) then let it cool enough to safely rub on your face, (you will have gross chunks of oatmeal hanging, but trust me, this is worth it) and let dry for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really keep my face super clear like it says, but the few zits I do get go away pretty quickly</li>
            <li>But when I started a new medicine and became very stressed, it wasn&#x27;t holding up.</li>
            <li>I live in a humid climate, so I can&#x27;t have too much hydration.  </li>
            <li>However, I would much rather use a non-moisturizing treatment and then add my preferred level of moisture on top, than use a treatment that is too heavy.  </li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older, I&#x27;ve had issues breaking out along the chin.  </li>
            <li>and my open spots have mostly healed without red irritation.</li>
            <li>I use it at night because I don&#x27;t particularly like the way it looks under make-up.</li>
            <li>It does not leave your skin red and itchy because of overdrying, leaves it hydrated and also absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>I wonder if Neutrogena has discontinued this particular product.</li>
            <li>This is the exact opposite; this worked very well and moisturized your face all in one application!</li>
            <li>like it ,maybe PHA is too harsh to me,acne prone skin better use some gentle stuffs</li>
            <li>I mainly use it as a daytime moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Same 2% salicylic acid with effective ph &amp;#60;4 and no or minimal alcohol.</li>
            <li>Very happy to find this product at Amazon as it can be difficult to find in local stores.</li>
            <li>My older sister, bought this on a whim, and allowed me to use it.</li>
            <li>your you, I highly recommend [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very effective way to control acne provided you are not sensitive to the product - it can cause excessive redness and peeling for some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>highly recommend it if you have oily skin and need something to help control acne.</li>
            <li>I have looked for lots of acne control product, and I found it in its website because of the high rate.</li>
            <li>I can highly recommend trying this</li>
            <li>I wish I had had this in high school.</li>
            <li>highly upset that this has been discontinued.</li>
            <li>the Rapid Clear (and many other products)</li>
            <li>Adult acne!!</li>
            <li>My major breakouts have been mitigated thanks to this Product!</li>
            <li>As a 21 year old male with light acne for the past 6 years, this is my favorite acne treatment product.  </li>
            <li>For me, I had more breakouts after using it for a few days.</li>
            <li>It works pretty fast and stops you from having future breakouts.</li>
            <li>btw I have normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li>The sulphur cream can be applied on top of a pimple, preferably a few times per day and within 12 hours you will see a rapid reduction of the pimple&#x27;s size and tenderness.</li>
            <li>It works quite effectively but slowly.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin which can be more oily or dry, depending on the season, with occasional hormone-related breakouts.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s only 2% salicylic acid, so it may not be strong enough for someone with moderate-to-severe acne.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much out of this product because I&#x27;ve tried so many other similar products and they never worked.</li>
            <li>Love this product--I am 41 and generally have great skin aside from annoying acne breakouts on my chin.  </li>
            <li>PROVED TO LIVE UP TO WHAT SHE NEEDED.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thankfully, Amazon came through and I have found my new source!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>and it helps to dry it up quickly.</li>
            <li>They do have a different one out there that sound similar, but I think I will buy it here until I can&#x27;t find it anymore.</li>
            <li>Her skin is very sensitive and began to peel, so she stopped after a week.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>My daughter has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Helps relieve redness and break-outs on my middle-aged, very sensitive skin without drying.  </li>
            <li>Not nearly as bad as some, but enough to shake my confidence and severely impact my social life.</li>
            <li>clear-- yet!</li>
            <li>Tried it for a month on my somewhat clear skin, and it does work!</li>
            <li>I usually do not review products, but I was amazed by the results I got from this acne treatment.</li>
            <li>(not sure what caused it), I did some googling and read many reviews....</li>
            <li>First it definitely fights acne.</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>I also have a somewhat sensitive face for face products where normal sunblock can make my eyes tear up and burn my face.</li>
            <li>This is the first product I found that could actually reduce redness on my acne.</li>
            <li>Worked pretty well back in the day.</li>
            <li>I prefer the active ingredient Salicylic Acid over products containing benzoyl peroxide because it doesn&#x27;t bleach fabrics and works better for me personally.  </li>
            <li>I also use Neutrogena deep clean in the morning and Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash Daily Scrub at night.  </li>
            <li>Now that I am older I only get breakouts once a month,  but its not the acne that really bothers me its the redness that stays afterwards that takes forever to go away.  </li>
            <li>But other than that simple &#x27;issue&#x27; I love this stuff so far.  </li>
            <li>I used to be a makeup artist/skin care consultant as well as sell skin care products and cosmetics at a department store, and while the products were good, there were no great options in my line at that time (quite a while back) for adults with blemish-prone skin, such as myself, who were also wanting \\&quot;just the right amount\\&quot; of hydration, which can be found in this Neutrogena product.</li>

            <li>Fyi, Neutrogena Rapid Clear Acne Defense Face Lotion 1.7 Fluid Ounce (50 ml) at about $7 is pretty close to this.  </li>
            <li>This has a liquid gel-like consistency and sinks in quickly.  </li>
            <li>I stayed away from products that had strong chemicals in thm for awhile as they would just leave my skin dried out</li>
            <li>It looks smoother, brighter, clearer, more even-toned and less red.   </li>
            <li>My blackheads got a lot smaller, as did the large pores around my nose.</li>
            <li>i have low acne, and i use it, and i got a little more,  but whatever, just buy it, i wont recommend this product, and i dont like it.</li>
            <li>people gets a bit of a boost when that morning mirror spotlights those little red spots that appear spontaneously, reminding the wearer that acne is not a teenage disease!  </li>
            <li>I can suddenly only find this here on amazon - it works great, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, and is pretty efficient overall, just now very hard to come by.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any improvement and it ended up being a huge waste of time and money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff is a clear gel, and goes on clear without leaving a residue so you can use it in the morning if you want to.  </li>
            <li>B0009F3O22 Neutrogena Rapid Clear Acne Defense Face Lotion</li>
            <li>/&gt;But, unlike Rapid Clear, it also moisturizes.</li>
            <li>I like the thickness of the Rapid Clear Lotion and sometimes apply THAT product over this treatment.</li>
            <li>I bought this hoping it would clear my acne.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t stop using it, it will clear up soon.</li>
            <li>This 2%salicylic acid gel exists elsewhere ([[ASIN:B001E96ORO Neutrogena Rapid Clear Acne Defense Face Lotion, 1.7 Ounce (</li>
            <li>They advised that this product was discontinued and they recommended the Rapid Clear line.  </li>
            <li>No heavy rubbing in.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, oily and acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>It also moisturizes my skin and makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I developed severe acne about 2 months ago</li>
            <li>Did nothing for my frequent cystic outbreaks or scarring.</li>
            <li>So far I got fewer pimples, but still do.</li>
            <li>As others reviews stated, being an adult with acne is a pain in the...</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that tends towards flakiness, redness and acne even in my forties</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried nearly every product on the market, OTC and prescription.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I think you&#x27;ll really like this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve suffered for adult acne for about 6 years.</li>
            <li>and this is the only thing that really works.</li>
            <li>I usually prefer a product to have more strength than this one, but I am able to apply this multiple times per day without excessive dryness.</li>
            <li>WHO HAS FREQUENT BREAK-OUTS.</li>
            <li>After a few days of use it feels like this is making my skin oily even though it says oil free.</li>
            <li>and I must say I have noticed considerable difference in both skin and acne.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for any one with sensitive skin who have acne.</li>

            <li>I wash my face with a medicated anti-bacterial complexion bar, then put this on afterwards (before this I was moisturizing with aloe vera, which actually works really well)</li>
            <li>It makes your skin soft as well.</li>
            <li>As an adult, it amazes me that I&#x27;m still prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li>It treats current acne, but doesn&#x27;t do much for preventing acne.</li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It will not give you movie star results but it will keep your skin soft and clear.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a few days, it&#x27;s almost like my skin got used to how light and weight-free this treatment is.</li>
            <li>leaves my face so soft.</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin and my skin took this product well.</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>I tried contacting Neutrogena directly, and they just sent me a stock response.</li>
            <li>When I get giant zits I do need to use a more heavy duty zit cream</li>
            <li>I wanted to like this product based on the reviews, but after a few short days noticed I was breaking out more</li>
            <li>After the 5 minutes are up, get an old washcloth, wipe off the chunks, rinse your face thoroughly in warm water, then wash as usual, and follow up with toning your skin with witch hazel (dirt cheap if you buy generic, usually in the rubbing alcohol aisle).</li>

            <li>I did ask a few months later if it was working, and if so, did she need me to order more.</li>
            <li>I started with Proactive (useless!), moved to Clearsil (dries skin out too much), then to an herbal acne treatment (ineffective), and, finally, after reading all the great reviews, decided to try this product.</li>
            <li>When I stopped being able to find it locally, I tried a couple other salycylic acid products and none of them had the same performance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Firstly the description says it might make your face dry</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry skin when I first wash my face</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong (can&#x27;t handle Benzoyl Peroxide all over the face so much) but not too weak.</li>
            <li>Every time it would go away, the next day, some new pimples would come!</li>
            <li>Does anyone just use it as part of their regular skin routine - does it help improve already fairly decent combination skin?  </li>
            <li>this was the first product that I used that got rid of my facial acne and kept the acne from coming back.</li>
            <li>All through high school I struggled with acne and accepted it as teenage fate.</li>
            <li>It is very soothing if you have itchy or dry or sensitive skin, all of which I have.</li>
            <li>I usually use it before my (even light) moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Strangely, I also really like the smell --</li>
            <li>Normally, the issues occur in the same areas every month or so.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and moisturizing so it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my skin too much.  </li>
            <li>Even though sometimes I still need an extra boost of a heavier moisturizer, I only apply it around my dry spots like around my nose which is amazing since I used to put heavy moisturizers all over my face before I bought this product.</li>
            <li>It was reasonably priced and is one of the few things that really worked well for me.</li>
            <li>If you do this on a regular basis, then these after-mask-breakouts should decrease and stop, as long as you are consistent.</li>
            <li>If you do this on a regular basis, then these after-mask-breakouts should decrease and stop, as long as you are consistent.</li>
            <li>This is not for acne, actually I didn&#x27;t see any good result, on the contrary it made it worse!</li>
            <li>Some of the acne subsided on its own but left behind marks.</li>
            <li>I was THIS close to biting the bullet and seeing a derm to get an Accutane presciption when I did a very general search on Amazon for &#x27;acne treatment&#x27; and looked at the highest reviewed products to see if I had missed something that I should try when I came across this product from Neutrogena.</li>
            <li>I used it diligently after washing my face each morning, and I could see major results within two weeks.</li>
            <li>We didn&#x27;t experience major breakout problems with this product, neither it helped preventing acnes.</li>
            <li>I usually use benzoyl peroxide lotions for those breakouts but those can be rough on my sensitive skin (redness, dryness), so I&#x27;m always looking for a better option.</li>
            <li>So I use it but not on major emergencies.</li>
            <li>So for people who have dry skin at first like me then turn into a greasy monster, give this product a definite go!</li>
            <li>I had always had clear skin and the sudden onset of acne without warning</li>
            <li>My skin is 90% clear, with the occasional breakout during my monthly.   </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak on the long term effects but if it helped this much over night I can only imagine after a week.</li>
            <li>and it feels like I&#x27;m just putting white clear cream on my face</li>
            <li>If you have scarring you will probably have to buy another cream for just that purpose, but if you got pimples only this product should clear it up</li>
            <li>recently switched to all natural products, so I won&#x27;t be using this anymore.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t matter if I was bare faced or wearing makeup or whether it was winter or summer.</li>
            <li>It is the adult way to manage &#x27;stress acne&#x27; - and everybody appreciates that there is currently certainly enough cause of this etiology of pimples!  </li>
            <li>I have seen marked improvements not only in acne</li>
            <li>even give me cortisone shots directly to some of the individual pimples of mine that have gone ballistic and become cysts.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>Only drops on acnes needed with everytime usage, so it&#x27;s pretty long lasting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 16 year old male BTW</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I could ever go back to any old product I was using...</li>
            <li>It feels very lightweight, sinks in, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li>My skin had gone back to a 10 years old&#x27;s, before I had any problems with</li>
            <li>WIth other products, I usually would look fine in the morning after washing my face and then sometime around the afternoon my forehead would get as shiny as a mirror!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom Line: I will likely continue using it for another month or so along with the Argan Oil (new find for acne) that I recently purchased based on the recommendation of a friend and eliminating oil and sugar from my diet - hopefully, this will do the trick.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t want to live my life without, only wish they made a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive combination skin with oily t zone and dry skin on cheeks and near the lips.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s about finding the right balance, so she&#x27;ll try applying it a few times a week and see how that goes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Background: I have combination skin normally, but it&#x27;s been exceptionally dry this winter.</li>
            <li>I use it as just a moisturizer or if I&#x27;m feeling really dry, I use a normal moisturizer under it before putting on foundation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus my skin is never dry because it hydrates!</li>
            <li>I definitely did not get the positive results that other reviewers had.</li>
            <li>Fist step is this Neutrogena Acne Stress Control, an oil free cleanser that once applied to the frustrating marks, penetrates with the action of a salicylic peel followed by herbs and moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>I did try a few Salycilic Acid treatments as well during this period with more or less the same results.</li>
            <li>Cleans and does not dry out her face.</li>
            <li>After allowing the joy that all of youth is not banished then it is time to treat the little flaws without resorting to the old ways of thick coverup goos from the past.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and gets dry, but this medicine keeps your skin hydrated</li>
            <li>I first wash off with the scrub and then apply this stress control after a little bit.</li>
            <li>It has just the right amount of active ingredients and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out at all.  </li>
            <li>A little bit of dryness, but that was expected and it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li>The salicylic acid gently exfoliates and reduces both existing and previous blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Upon receiving my package, my expectations were slightly deflated as I noticed the treatment was seemed very . . .</li>
            <li>This stuff does not dry out my skin, but definitely helps keep the bumps at bay.</li>
            <li>Finally, it does not dry out my skin</li>
            <li>This is a gel-based lotion, whose main active ingredient is 2% salicylic acid.</li>
            <li>It may have helped clear my face some, but I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to see a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Something that also works well, OVERNIGHT, to dry them up on my son&#x27;s teenage and sensitive skin is [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only thing that takes care of my adult acne and doesn&#x27;t totally dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t work miracles but the &amp;#34;Acne Stress Control&amp;#34; line has brought my acne down to a more manageable level without irritating my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin so finding the right product that doesn&#x27;t cause to much dryness or to much oiliness is very difficult.</li>
            <li>I have a very stressful job and this little angel helped to keep those stress pimples away.</li>
            <li>as for acne control, it may have a little help, but not too much.</li>
            <li>so I am not sure how old this particular batch is.</li>
            <li>this product certainly did not work for me and even left a green gooey residue.</li>
            <li>Although I don&#x27;t really have bad ache, have more oily skin with some some redness</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;d have stockpiled like 20 of them or something because it was that great!</li>
            <li> This addresses both of those points wonderfully.</li>

            <li> Good luck!</li>
            <li> It feels good on your skin, helps to balance any redness, and it&#x27;s a perfect makeup primer.</li>
            <li> I always had beautiful skin before that.</li>
            <li> Going from beautiful skin to acne is hearbreaking but through the years you become an expert because you&#x27;ve tried almost everything thing from presciptions, over the counter, and even products from Mexico.</li>
            <li> very pleased really excellent product I can recommend it met my expectations</li>
            <li> Feels great by being a gel.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I found something that works on my acne.</li>
            <li> But the product is GREAT.</li>
            <li> some people say it worked great for them, but not for me.</li>
            <li> Great if you have acne and is even mentioned by Paula from Paula&#x27;s choice.</li>
            <li> Great product and inexpensive</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have found this, and so grateful.  </li>
            <li> Lol</li>

            <li> great product..</li>
            <li> I use this every night after I wash my face, and it is working great.</li>
            <li> This is so great.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Great Product.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m incredibly happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Great at clearing up the face.</li>
            <li> and everyone thinks I have great skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I decided to stick through this treatment since I already paid for it, and I&#x27;m happy to say that I made that</li>
            <li> but i wont be happy</li>
            <li> I am happy to report that this product works, and works well.</li>
            <li> it is a great product!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is hydrating and weightless and has worked great for me with the use of the rest of the line.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this product!!</li>
            <li> Love this acne treatment, just wish I could buy it in the stores!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this for a more affordable BHA exfoliant!!</li>
            <li> Very effective results.  </li>
            <li> and I must say it has been very effective.</li>
            <li> I use it in morning after bath and in the evening after washing my face and it does work... very effective.</li>
            <li> Also to the smell is amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s reduced my outbreaks by around 90%, which is a remarkable improvement.</li>
            <li> and it remains effective for upto 7 hours!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many things over the years, and have found my perfect treatment.  </li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve ever used better than pro-active, and does not leave your face oily.</li>
            <li> so I was thrilled to see I could get it on amazon prime!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t ned to apply a lot of product, it hydrates your face really nice!</li>
            <li> As said this product is amazing and I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> This is really good stuff, don&#x27;t understand why Neutrogena no longer makes it</li>
            <li> but I see where those in my age range (50s) and women with menopausal acne have good results.  </li>
            <li> It was shipped in good time, and arrived in good shape.    </li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t seem to be good for cystic hormonal breakouts.</li>
            <li> my skin feels good after using this product, help with the acne, and hydrating all the time~</li>
            <li> the price is good too</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m feeling as good about myself as I have since</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t so it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works well, and a good value since it comes in a 2 oz tube.</li>
            <li> Also, the price is really good.</li>
            <li> good for acne stress control</li>
            <li> I gave this stuff a good try</li>
            <li> For the price, I think it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a good product to try if you struggle with acne, just be patient.</li>
            <li> It would be a good every day acne preventative</li>
            <li> This is good for fading spots that a pimple leaves though</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s good for us.</li>
            <li> So this is a really good deal...</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it is so good</li>
            <li> I read a lot of good reviews</li>
            <li> It didnt break my face out so thats good.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter-in-law at Christmas after hearing her complain about her acne and reading what looked to be good reviews on this product.</li>
            <li> Wish I could say something good about it</li>
            <li> and I will be super happy!</li>
            <li> You will love your beautiful looking skin with this product!!!!!  :-)</li>
            <li> I love this acne gel, it is my very favorite!</li>
            <li> Helped tremendously!!!</li>
            <li> WIth this product, my face looks very healthy and even.</li>
            <li> The formula is moisturizing and smells good, which I liked.  </li>
            <li> I was pretty impressed.  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Non-irritating, clears acne, reduces redness, and makes your face feel smooth !!</li>
            <li> I love this product and can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s been discontinued!</li>
            <li> I will definitely by more!</li>
            <li> My skin is so much better!  </li>
            <li> May not be suitable for everyone but good product.  </li>
            <li> After using this more acne started to appear!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> My pimples started going away (my face looks so much better!)</li>
            <li> Saved my life more than once !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, shrinking my breakouts 70% overnight.   </li>
            <li> Oil free stress control 3-n-1 is great for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of its amazing review.</li>
            <li> But the Neutrogena Oil Free Ance Stress Control is great, because it moisturizes my face without it looking greasy throughout the day; and at night I use a &amp;#34;heavier&amp;#34; moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be amazing</li>
            <li> I tried this product and really liked it.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s not a kit, you can just buy what you need and when so that is nice too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Docked 1 star because the product does not seem to help with minimizing breakouts or reducing the severity or duration of breakouts, which is kind of its purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On that note, I have to say that the product doesn&#x27;t seem to be all that effective at diminishing scars, marks, and hyperpigmentation as a result of acne.</li>
            <li> it is kind of hit or miss</li>
            <li> I really liked that it was moisturizing,</li>
            <li> Kind of like I remember when I was a teenager and slathered benzyl peroxide all over my face.</li>
            <li> I am kind of nervous that I never see this in the store.</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t seem to be effectively treating the acne I already had before I started using it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was kind of hesitant about this product when I saw that it was Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> I know some people probably aren&#x27;t a fan of it, but it smells kind of minty to me.</li>
            <li> and now I have flawless, glowing skin thanks to Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> But now I am setting up my own kids with this system.</li>
            <li> and this kind of just feels like a gel.  </li>
            <li> Acne Stress control has the appropriate amount of salicylic acid, along with the right pH for best exfoliation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But pretty much, it&#x27;s awesome, like magic and probably discontinued because Neutrogena doesn&#x27;t bet on the winners.</li>
            <li> In my experience, it works best at preventing new acne</li>
            <li> I still have to use a dot of light moisturizer around my lips, but this is a great formula that will leave your skin hydrated AND protected :)</li>
            <li> Has a great feeling to it and even has a great natural smell.</li>
            <li> and it has a nice smell whereas most acne products stink.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best acne moisturizer I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> This is the best hydrating acne treatment I have used so far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a great product and definitely worth the $12 dollars.</li>
            <li> love love love this!</li>
            <li> the product is great for your face works good, and is a good price as well you can see the change as long as you go buy the instructions.</li>
            <li> natural smell and very pleasant as well.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m pretty happy about that.  </li>
            <li> For the first year, Proactiv worked great even if it had a not-so-great price tag.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a very light liquid.</li>
            <li> At first I used it morning and night and experienced no adverse effects, and when I didn&#x27;t break out any more</li>
            <li> I loved this stuff so much!!  </li>
            <li> AND it controls my oily skin which is another huge bonus!</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders on my acne and doesnt make me me more sun-sensitive.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> Most of my breakouts though are hormonal.</li>
            <li> After about a week of use, most of my acne has cleared up.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure it wouldn&#x27;t work well for everyone -</li>
            <li> (Most preparations are solutions rather than emulsions or suspensions, and thus alcohol is required to dissolve the salicylic acid, which is not water soluble.)    </li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re okay with using these things, go for it.</li>
            <li> It helps but isn&#x27;t as drying as most of these types of acne creams are.....</li>
            <li> This product worked way quicker and better than any others I tried, including Proactive.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who looks for something lightweight, feels great and wants to keep pimples from popping up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite BHA product for a number of reasons.</li>
            <li> The formulation is actually great - very lightweight, almost like a serum; it feels like nothing on your skin.  </li>
            <li> but this stuff really works to keep my face looking great.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s one more product at this point, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are suffering from acne, most experts will tell you the wash isn&#x27;t where you need your Benzoyl Peroxide or Salicylic Acid, it&#x27;s your toner and moisturizer where you need your acne treatment.</li>
            <li> and I am in love with it.</li>
            <li> I sincerely hope that Neutrogena is listening.</li>
            <li> Best of all, it is totally invisible after it is applied.</li>
            <li> more acne started to appear after using if for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I used a doctor recommended moisturizer but that resulted in more breakouts.</li>
            <li> I like it better than prescribed medications from my doctor.</li>
            <li> I bought this produce mostly to minimize my pores on my nose, which it did not do.</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena products.</li>
            <li> This stuff is just ok.</li>
            <li> Like many people who suffered from acne since childhood, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of anti-acne products out there.  </li>
            <li> works like magic.  </li>
            <li> Smells ok.</li>
            <li> when I stop using it, that&#x27;s when more acne comes.</li>
            <li> then it sure wont work for severe acne.</li>
            <li> I have tried many treatments and combinations of products.</li>
            <li> , but I was hoping for something more.  </li>
            <li> She has tried a lot of products and this one has worked better then any of the others.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the smothness and softness I get from this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Seems alright.&lt;br /&gt;Not magic</li>
            <li> after seeing this product on Amazon and reading reviews I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had tried many acne creams but did not found anything like this.</li>
            <li> I still think the charcoal soaps work better</li>
            <li> My breakouts are almost gone, and skin feels much better.  </li>
            <li> There are so many things I love about this product.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough about how wonderful it</li>
            <li> Perfect light weight summer moisturizer for sensitive skin that is prone to break outs.  </li>
            <li> Trust me try it and you will love it</li>
            <li> Plus for the cheap price, there isn&#x27;t a risk!</li>
            <li> I have breakouts on my forehead mostly.</li>
            <li> I bought this after I received a facial and the facialist explained that my pores needed exfoliation but that scrubs probably weren&#x27;t the best idea for my reactive skin.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell, too.  </li>
            <li> I mostly \\&quot;outgrew\\&quot;</li>
            <li> My face is now more appealing and my acne has practically vanished.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found anything better, and frankly have no desire to switch to anything else at this point because I am quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> Absoultely love...just ordered more.</li>
            <li> Again I love this product....</li>
            <li> Been using it for 5 months now, worked better for me than Proactive, so had to write something.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using the $38 per 1 ounce \\&quot;ClearPrep FX Matte Foundation Primer and Anti-Acne Treatment\\&quot; from Sephora, which I LOVE, yet...</li>
            <li> It is amazing and leaves my skin feeling smooth and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> Much better than on here</li>
            <li> get lever 200 soap or dial soap to wach your acne face better...</li>
            <li> It would be excellent if supplemented with an occasional BHA peel! :)</li>
            <li> the span of the two most stressful weeks at work and planning my wedding during my \\&quot;time off,\\</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s literally the most moisturizing product EVER.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s like putting water on my face (in the best way possible).</li>
            <li> But I can say my skin just FEELS better.</li>
            <li> and I can tell you that this works better than anything they sell, and for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> Murad costs about 5 times more, however.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> would recommend this :) .</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> but I think it works on most.</li>
            <li> best face lotion for oily skin point blank period.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and seems to work very well.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s more of a post-cleansing and moisturizing</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, but you don&#x27;t want to turn your face shiny and oily, right?</li>
            <li> THANKS NEUTROGENA!!!!</li>
            <li> It really works!!!!</li>
            <li> I do love the consistency and smell and it is pretty good at keeping skin moisturized too,</li>
            <li> It also has a nice, mild scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of mild in my opinion, sort of cucumber-ish</li>
            <li> But I have super oily skin, so it might not work for those you with nice sensitve</li>
            <li> clear your acne ,this one works ,and  very light very nice smell</li>
            <li> This product works best when you use it every single night.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is alcohol free but its a very light exfoliating gel....</li>
            <li> VERY light, smooth, and does not have a strong odor.</li>
            <li> Make sure to use foundation or some light sunscreen with it as it doesn&#x27;t have the SPF.</li>
            <li> Please make this product more available.</li>
            <li> I paired this with Cetaphil&#x27;s Gentle Skin Cleaner and my skin has NEVER looked this good.</li>
            <li> This gel goes on light and smells good - not too strong just a light fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> I use this right before bed on alternating nights and skip the moisturizer because this provides a nice moist feeling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It absorbs to the skin very quickly.  </li>
            <li> this stuff makes my life easy.</li>
            <li> I have found over the years that some of the best options for clear, healthy skin can be found for cheap in your own kitchen, at your local drugstore, and of course, on Amazon.</li>
            <li> All of the Neutrogena 3-in1 products are quality made and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good combo and decent price.</li>
            <li> This is pretty amazing considering I have had to have my dermatologist</li>
            <li> I first purchased this product in January because of all the amazing reviews I had read about it.</li>
            <li> I love the cool feeling and the smell it has</li>
            <li> Okay, one full cycle.  </li>
            <li> Hands down the best acne product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> There are two fine steps to take.  </li>
            <li> Over all the most AMAZING acne vanishing product (better than proactive or clean and clear).</li>
            <li> very light yet just the right touch of moisture.</li>
            <li> that really matters is that this amazing acne treatment has returned to being available.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a month and it made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Make-up goes on smooth over it.  </li>
            <li> This stuff glide on smooth.</li>
            <li> The scent is light.</li>
            <li> so I lightly apply it to my problem areas in the morning after washing my face.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, though Amazon tends to have the lowest price.  </li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product that appears to no longer be available…anywhere???</li>
            <li> Of course, as I said before, stress and diet control is equally important.</li>
            <li> I think its really fit to my skin, as she recommended.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, it does not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> (I have combination) and the scent is light and pleasing.  </li>
            <li> This helped the pore to be smaller and I am happy about that.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s done a great job in keeping my face relatively acne-free.  </li>
            <li> So happy I found this product after it seemed to be discontinued in all the my local stores.</li>
            <li> B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System, 0.68-Fluid Ounce]]</li>
            <li> These things along with the Neutrogena Oil Free Acnee Stress Control 3-in-1</li>
            <li> this is such a great product.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> I will say that this product is no longer available in stores and the expiration date is this December</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who has acne products and is looking for an amazing treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels hydrated and really smooth.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Oil Free Moisture SPF 35, 2.5  Ounce]].</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a product that feels good on your skin, is gentle, smells nice and helps clear up break outs</li>
            <li> thanks for offering such a great service!</li>
            <li> So glad amazon brought this back, this really is a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a gentle, daily BHA, this is one of the best formulations around.  </li>
            <li> so I guess for her it is doing a good enough job or better than anything else she has tried.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell, doesnt dryout your skin, and instead leavesyour skin feeling cool and clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I am not blemish free but my face looks pretty darn good thanks to this stuff.</li>
            <li> I used this consistently with the Stress Control face wash for about 2 weeks and for some reason I was getting more acne that I had before.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I&#x27;ve seen significant improvement with his skin compared to 2 years ago.</li>
            <li> So far I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> B000GCQ04C Dickinson&#x27;s Original Witch Hazel Pore</li>
            <li> I was excited when I read others reviews about this product.</li>
            <li> this product doesn&#x27;t seem to be available locally at this point, so I tried Amazon and was thrilled to be able to get it sent out automatically every couple of months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure the smell just tricks me into thinking the treatment is working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first your skin may break out more as it &amp;#34;boils&amp;#34; all the acne to the surface.</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t happy with how long it took for the product to work</li>
            <li> Seems to work pretty well for most acne spots.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different products and this one is the best by far.</li>
            <li> But after I used it, it made my skin broke-out although it is oil-free and clean.</li>
            <li> addition, a really effective (and cheap) way to keep your pores and skin clear is something you may already have in your kitchen cupboards...</li>
            <li> Nothing will stop the flow of oil (which keeps me looking much younger than my 60 years), but I highly recommend this product as something that does as good a job as anything else and treats my skin kindly.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the Neutrogena Complete Acne System and they have both made my skin better in just 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> Foods Jojoba Oil Pure, 4 ounce]] for keeping my skin soft without breaking it out (please see my review on that amazing stuff)!</li>
            <li> would recommend it very highly to anyone for sure</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and is absorbed into the skin, leaving no stickiness or shine.</li>
            <li> I also tried various pills that had good feedback from acne sufferers.</li>
            <li> ok for combination skin but doesn&#x27;t help the blackheads on my oily nose where I really needed the salicylic acid to work.</li>
            <li> Well worth the cheap price.</li>
            <li> but overall it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving it so far.</li>
            <li> Then later I found good price on Neutrogena website.</li>
            <li> Thanks to many acne forums, I found that if you mix 50% \\&quot;Monistat Soothing Care</li>
            <li> Makes acne fade away, redness goes away and keeps skin full with moisture.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products and none have worked as well and gently as this product.  </li>
            <li> This oil free line from Neutrogena is great and costs less than the olay kit.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does a great job of keeping your skin clear and very soft.</li>
            <li> I have used the Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Stress Control product for several years now and absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li> The other Murad item that is a great spot treatment is the Sulphur cream.</li>
            <li> more than it hurts but didn&#x27;t give me any huge difference as far as hydration or acne</li>
            <li> When I get a bump it decreases the redness and heals it quick.  </li>
            <li> Service ws quick and came undamaged because it was well-packed.</li>
            <li> Remember different skin types respond to different treatments, so search until you find what works best for you.  </li>
            <li> If it didn&#x27;t work for my mild acne</li>
            <li> I still think control stress and diet is the most important thing to deal with adult acnes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also bought him another bottle of Origin super spot remover and acne treatment gel which is around 15 dollars on origin website.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and mild acne.  </li>
            <li> and it gone quick</li>
            <li> It absorbs into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li> I hope this product appears back in stores sometime soon, so many people love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice packaging and consistency of the actual product was light and cooling.</li>
            <li> I bought this to be used as a mild chemical exfoliant for my aging, yet still combination/acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Now I can&#x27;t even see my pores in my lighted 10x magnification mirror, and it has greatly reduced the slight redness I had around my nose and on my chin.  </li>
            <li> Hydrating Acne Treatment have helped me quite alot in keeping my skin much clearer more consistently than without</li>
            <li> which is a real bummer!!  </li>
            <li> Now they are still kind of there, but a lot less prominent and</li>
            <li> This is just like every other acne treatment you have tried.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing particularly special or good about it.</li>
            <li> My face now looks relatively clean now, and people around me really noticed the change!</li>
            <li> I have found over the years that some of the best options for clear, healthy skin can be found for cheap in your own kitchen, at your local drugstore, and of course, on Amazon.nsistency (thicker than if you were preparing it to eat) then let it cool enough to safely rub on your face, (you will have gross chunks of oatmeal hanging, but trust me, this is worth it) and let dry for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Most of the time it is hard to find good price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Spent so much money trying to find the best face wash to clear up my unwanted zits.</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s ideal for people in their teens to late thirties.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week and my skin just looks amazing.</li>
            <li> Goes on light with no irritating ingredients...just does what it is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need much, so looks like it will last me a good while.  </li>
            <li> I have tried dozens of products, supplements and diets without success.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had success with.  </li>
            <li> And It helps clear up acne quickly!!(2-3 days at most)</li>
            <li> I used the Neutrogena Rapid Clear product line for quite some time, and have always been pleased with it.</li>
            <li> However, this product has broken the pattern and provided EXCELLENT acne prevention without over-drying.</li>
            <li> I have to use it 3 times a day to keep my skin without oil but its worth it.</li>
            <li> Well worth it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it all the time because I have since switched to more natural products, but my skin did respond well to it</li>
            <li> I have had acne since elementary school, and I&#x27;m now 29.  </li>
            <li> My daughter being using this product for a week and her face looks clear she looks Moore confident now.</li>
            <li> I thought this product had been discontinued, but I&#x27;m thrilled to see that it&#x27;s back in stock!</li>
            <li> I expect Neutrogena 3-in-1 hydrating acne treatment  will be discontinued because it is a better value than the Rapid Clear Acne Defense Face Lotion.</li>
            <li> The reason I decided to switch to using japanese skin products is because their skin care products are much more advanced than ours here in the staes.</li>
            <li> Wash your face well, make sure your facial surface is clean, and put these on and it will take care of the rest.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My zits are gone and my acne is disappearing right before my eyes.</li>
            <li> I tend to use this either when I&#x27;m home all day during the weekend or right before bed.</li>
            <li> I can use this at night and not worry about having to put on a moisturizer on my face right after applying the treatment.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right, an oatmeal mask.</li>
            <li> I ordered it right away.  </li>
            <li> Over the last year I&#x27;d developed a fairly persistent case of mild acne.</li>
            <li> This product does a decent job of clearing my skin up and keeping me oil free.  </li>
            <li> but when I went to walmarts website to buy more I found out it is apparently out of stock online.  </li>
            <li> The only good thing about this item is how soft it makes your skin.</li>
            <li> Before buying this product I was using proactiv for $45 each month and this item is just as good for a lot less.</li>
            <li> I have had visibly better skin, and it does not dry my skin out</li>
            <li> This is the only acne treatment that I use because it&#x27;s gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> Benzoyl Peroxide for whatever reason just doesn&#x27;t seem to like my skin very much.</li>
            <li> Price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> have very light occasional acne/dry skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use very much product</li>
            <li> If you wear foundation/makeup daily as I do, it is very important to have a barrier between your skin and the foundation, as there&#x27;s all kinds of \\&quot;goodies\\&quot; in the foundation that can add to skin irritation and breakouts.</li>
            <li> a great product for someone a little older (like me) who still has issues with blemishes, but needs some moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it did the absolute best job on keeping my acne away, but just making it less red is an achievement in itself with my skin.     </li>
            <li> and I have used it on new pimples with good results - it doesn&#x27;t over dry or irritate my skin around the pimple.</li>
            <li> My very oily skin (which I am sure I&#x27;ll appreciate when I get older) has an uphill battle to stay blemish free and can become monster-bad if I am not very strict with water intake and many many other variables.  </li>
            <li> When I start to run out I will most definitely  come back and order some more.</li>
            <li> Even though I know that most topical products do nothing for hormonal acne, I thought this might help because of the words &amp;#34;stress control&amp;#34; in the name.</li>
            <li> In the last 3 days, I&#x27;ve been using this Neutrogena Hydrating Acne Treatment on my upper arms, and the difference is remarkable.</li>
            <li> I did experience some dryness for the first week, and just skip the benzyl peroxide if my skin is too irritated.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what exactly it was.</li>
            <li> I first put it on my skin</li>
            <li> Every day I&#x27;ve waited for my acne to show back up and every day my face looks better than the day before.</li>
            <li> wash most mornings and every night before bed with OLAY FOAMING FACE WASH in the blue pump bottle.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a week, but the results have been stunning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with Acne for many years, now I&#x27;m in my mid 20s</li>
            <li> Thanks Neoutrogena!</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> The De La Cruz sulfur ointment that I ordered around the same time made a much more noticeable improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> Can be overly drying at times for your skin so don&#x27;t use too much but helps prevent/diminish breakouts!</li>
            <li> but if you suddenly get more pimples when you first try it, don&#x27;t get worried because that is suppose to happen so</li>
            <li> The only gripe I have is I wish it came in a flip top cap.  </li>
            <li> and I would buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> I began using this product several years ago, around the time when it was first put on the shelves, and have been using it for many years.</li>
            <li> Do this about 2 or so times a week, (although I recommend witch hazel daily for toning) and you will notice a difference I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> Do this about 2 or so times a week, (although I recommend witch hazel daily for toning) and you will notice a difference I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> Yes, I&#x27;m aware my skin problems are not solely the fault of this product...</li>
            <li> I love that this enables me to use only one.</li>
            <li> I never really felt like any of their products made a difference, you kind of just used it for the sake of putting something on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Be sure to use every night AFTER washing - daytime use is possible but it does not mix well with sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It does have a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; feel but not uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I bought japanese acne treatment and it works so much better.</li>
            <li> but I would switch back to this if they ever decide to make it again because I like the smell of this better than Aveeno&#x27;s formula.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this product for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> B000052YJL Clean &amp; Clear Persa-Gel</li>
            <li> It really is the best thing out there and trumps pretty much all of Neutrogena&#x27;s other products (and perhaps all other mainstream acne treatment products, period).</li>
            <li> I can only hope this isn&#x27;t just a tease and that this is back for good.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try since it had a lot of positive reviews.</li>
            <li> (if you have oily skin, because pretty much, you want your skin to think it doesn&#x27;t need to produce oil, so you won&#x27;t have your problems, so you need to over-moisturize) step.</li>
            <li> I tried many different things to fix it with limited success, including products like Proactiv, Acne Free, and even the very highly reviewed &#x27;Regimen&#x27; from Acne.org.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually ordering the entire system when I get a chance, to see if it works best when used with the other products.</li>
            <li> I love love LOVE this product and only ordered it off Amazon once it went missing in local stores here&lt;</li>
            <li> My skin is SUPER sensitive to salicylic acid washes/creams.</li>
            <li> and I have lots of redness and flaky large pores.  </li>
            <li> : Neutrogena no longer sells this in this large tube.</li>
            <li> It would be great if it less harmful chemicals, hence only a 4 instead of 5 star review.</li>
            <li> I have mild acne, however when I used this it didn&#x27;t really clear much away</li>
            <li> The problem for most adults is we need to have a barrier that doesn&#x27;t dry out our skin, but doesn&#x27;t add too much moisturizer which contributes to blemishes.</li>
            <li> Not too drying for mature skin and still effective for mild to moderate, non-cystic acne of a teen.</li>
            <li> I use it primarily to keep my skin smooth and soft, which it does with only occasional use, but it also noticeably helps to prevent pimples and gets rid of milia quickly.</li>
            <li> I use this product as a spot treatment in the morning rather than to spread over my whole face, mostly because I&#x27;m prone to very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Their people are known to be obsessed with skin care and are famous for their beautiful skin, so there is high demand over there for skin care products that actually works.</li>
            <li> However, I saw this similar product available at a much lower cost per ounce, so I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It helped to calm my skin and keep it clear</li>
            <li> if you have really stubborn acne you&#x27;ll probably want to get something else.</li>
            <li> was a real shocker.</li>
            <li> star - the product is reasonably priced&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get much moisture from this product, but it did reduce redness.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely amazed by the results of this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product really does hydrate your skin.  </li>
            <li> Much of this information I got from Paula&#x27;s Choice [...].</li>
            <li> The beta-hydroxy acid in this really works - it penetrates pores to really get the job done, but isn&#x27;t too drying .. or too oily.</li>
            <li> It leaves the affected skin feeling fresh and a bit tingly and preps that areas for completion of treatment with Neutrogena&#x27;s Rapid Clear.  </li>
            <li> This combination is working really well for me.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended !</li>
            <li> I figured it was time to really start looking into products to get rid of this stuff.</li>
            <li> I used this when I got out of the shower, after using the Neutrogena oil free acne wash, and had visible results the next morning.</li>
            <li> it all keeps my face clear, pours unclogged, face fresh and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is just too much for my skin or what</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have acne.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to eliminate the blackheads on my nose, it did absolutely nothing</li>
            <li> These bottles weren&#x27;t very helpful for me.</li>
            <li> a couple of weeks ago my face suddenly got filled with acne</li>
            <li> This product worked rather well on my very prone acne skin.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t help as much as I&#x27;d hoped it would.</li>
            <li> I was intensely embarrassed and didn&#x27;t want anyone to see me...</li>
            <li> Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser, For all skin types, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]]</li>
            <li> and I really like it a lot.  </li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> The pimple shrunk and most important, the pain is practically GONE, it usually takes about 3-5 days for the pain to completely disappear after one like that, but this time it went so much faster!  </li>
            <li> For me, this product does prevent acne and it really does hydrate your skin.</li>
            <li> then my skin would over compensate forthat and get really oily.</li>
            <li> I bought this for spot treatment and it works really well.  </li>
            <li> but it is very lingering so some people might not like that.</li>
            <li> It really has made quite a difference in the appearance of my skin.  </li>
            <li> It is really reduce stress for acne.</li>
            <li> This treatment works very well.</li>
            <li> cant really help me..</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t really get acne unless my period is coming</li>
            <li> This is disappearing from stores, but Neutroogena still sells it for a reasonable price on their site.</li>
            <li> Didnt really do much for me.</li>
            <li> It really hydrates your skin.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do much to my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s incredibly gentle on your skin</li>
            <li> In addition to keeping my pores clear, this salicylic acid preparation has worked better than finacea (azelaic acid) at reducing my skin&#x27;s (especially my nose&#x27;s) redness, which is caused by rosacea.  </li>
            <li> My face is so clear, better than in years, and I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Eh, it&#x27;s okay, but certainly no miracle.</li>
            <li> This stuff is just plain amazing.</li>
            <li> (the body lotion has the same ingredients as the \\&quot;special face\\&quot; lotion, but is much cheaper), and a gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li> I originally thought it was for younger people</li>
            <li> Additionally, the acne stress control lotion is the only salicylic acid preparation I could find that does not contain significant amounts of alcohol, which irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> It did seem to make any other lotion I put on top of it (moisturizer, sunscreen) seem \\&quot;tacky\\&quot; or \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; though.</li>
            <li> You will need to play with it to figure out how many times per day you should use it, for me it depends on what other products I am using on my face that day (sunscreen, makeup, moisturizers).</li>
            <li> I used it for about a month straight, mainly around my nose area to help get rid of my blackheads.</li>
            <li> As long as my stress level is medium it works fine.  </li>
            <li> I use it under my make-up and my break outs have pretty much gone completely away.</li>
            <li> It is refreshing, and soft on the dry skin and yet helps reduce breakouts and reduce the scars.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, it can still be found online via Amazon and other sites, including Neutrogena&#x27;s own website (where it&#x27;s actually slightly cheaper to buy than from the vendors who list it here on Amazon).</li>
            <li> Hydrating Acne Treatment\\&quot; then it will work as effectively as the ClearPrep primer (if not better), in that it prevents blemishes and shrink pores over time as well as the ClearPrep $38/oz for under $10/oz.  </li>
            <li> All you have to do is take about 1/3-1/2 cup of dry oatmeal, add very warm water to it to make a pretty thick consistency (thicker than if you were preparing it to eat) then let it cool enough to safely rub on your face, (you will have gross chunks of oatmeal hanging, but trust me, this is worth it) and let dry for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really keep my face super clear like it says, but the few zits I do get go away pretty quickly</li>
            <li> But when I started a new medicine and became very stressed, it wasn&#x27;t holding up.</li>
            <li> I live in a humid climate, so I can&#x27;t have too much hydration.  </li>
            <li> However, I would much rather use a non-moisturizing treatment and then add my preferred level of moisture on top, than use a treatment that is too heavy.  </li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older, I&#x27;ve had issues breaking out along the chin.  </li>
            <li> and my open spots have mostly healed without red irritation.</li>
            <li> I use it at night because I don&#x27;t particularly like the way it looks under make-up.</li>
            <li> It does not leave your skin red and itchy because of overdrying, leaves it hydrated and also absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> I wonder if Neutrogena has discontinued this particular product.</li>
            <li> This is the exact opposite; this worked very well and moisturized your face all in one application!</li>
            <li> like it ,maybe PHA is too harsh to me,acne prone skin better use some gentle stuffs</li>
            <li> I mainly use it as a daytime moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Same 2% salicylic acid with effective ph &amp;#60;4 and no or minimal alcohol.</li>
            <li> Very happy to find this product at Amazon as it can be difficult to find in local stores.</li>
            <li> My older sister, bought this on a whim, and allowed me to use it.</li>
            <li> your you, I highly recommend [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very effective way to control acne provided you are not sensitive to the product - it can cause excessive redness and peeling for some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> highly recommend it if you have oily skin and need something to help control acne.</li>
            <li> I have looked for lots of acne control product, and I found it in its website because of the high rate.</li>
            <li> I can highly recommend trying this</li>
            <li> I wish I had had this in high school.</li>
            <li> highly upset that this has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> the Rapid Clear (and many other products)</li>
            <li> Adult acne!!</li>
            <li> My major breakouts have been mitigated thanks to this Product!</li>
            <li> As a 21 year old male with light acne for the past 6 years, this is my favorite acne treatment product.  </li>
            <li> For me, I had more breakouts after using it for a few days.</li>
            <li> It works pretty fast and stops you from having future breakouts.</li>
            <li> btw I have normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li> The sulphur cream can be applied on top of a pimple, preferably a few times per day and within 12 hours you will see a rapid reduction of the pimple&#x27;s size and tenderness.</li>
            <li> It works quite effectively but slowly.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin which can be more oily or dry, depending on the season, with occasional hormone-related breakouts.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s only 2% salicylic acid, so it may not be strong enough for someone with moderate-to-severe acne.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much out of this product because I&#x27;ve tried so many other similar products and they never worked.</li>
            <li> Love this product--I am 41 and generally have great skin aside from annoying acne breakouts on my chin.  </li>
            <li> PROVED TO LIVE UP TO WHAT SHE NEEDED.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thankfully, Amazon came through and I have found my new source!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> and it helps to dry it up quickly.</li>
            <li> They do have a different one out there that sound similar, but I think I will buy it here until I can&#x27;t find it anymore.</li>
            <li> Her skin is very sensitive and began to peel, so she stopped after a week.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Helps relieve redness and break-outs on my middle-aged, very sensitive skin without drying.  </li>
            <li> Not nearly as bad as some, but enough to shake my confidence and severely impact my social life.</li>
            <li> clear-- yet!</li>
            <li> Tried it for a month on my somewhat clear skin, and it does work!</li>
            <li> I usually do not review products, but I was amazed by the results I got from this acne treatment.</li>
            <li> (not sure what caused it), I did some googling and read many reviews....</li>
            <li> First it definitely fights acne.</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> I also have a somewhat sensitive face for face products where normal sunblock can make my eyes tear up and burn my face.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I found that could actually reduce redness on my acne.</li>
            <li> Worked pretty well back in the day.</li>
            <li> I prefer the active ingredient Salicylic Acid over products containing benzoyl peroxide because it doesn&#x27;t bleach fabrics and works better for me personally.  </li>
            <li> I also use Neutrogena deep clean in the morning and Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash Daily Scrub at night.  </li>
            <li> Now that I am older I only get breakouts once a month,  but its not the acne that really bothers me its the redness that stays afterwards that takes forever to go away.  </li>
            <li> But other than that simple &#x27;issue&#x27; I love this stuff so far.  </li>
            <li> I used to be a makeup artist/skin care consultant as well as sell skin care products and cosmetics at a department store, and while the products were good, there were no great options in my line at that time (quite a while back) for adults with blemish-prone skin, such as myself, who were also wanting \\&quot;just the right amount\\&quot; of hydration, which can be found in this Neutrogena product.</li>

            <li> Fyi, Neutrogena Rapid Clear Acne Defense Face Lotion 1.7 Fluid Ounce (50 ml) at about $7 is pretty close to this.  </li>
            <li> This has a liquid gel-like consistency and sinks in quickly.  </li>
            <li> I stayed away from products that had strong chemicals in thm for awhile as they would just leave my skin dried out</li>
            <li> It looks smoother, brighter, clearer, more even-toned and less red.   </li>
            <li> My blackheads got a lot smaller, as did the large pores around my nose.</li>
            <li> i have low acne, and i use it, and i got a little more,  but whatever, just buy it, i wont recommend this product, and i dont like it.</li>
            <li> people gets a bit of a boost when that morning mirror spotlights those little red spots that appear spontaneously, reminding the wearer that acne is not a teenage disease!  </li>
            <li> I can suddenly only find this here on amazon - it works great, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, and is pretty efficient overall, just now very hard to come by.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any improvement and it ended up being a huge waste of time and money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff is a clear gel, and goes on clear without leaving a residue so you can use it in the morning if you want to.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;But, unlike Rapid Clear, it also moisturizes.</li>
            <li> I like the thickness of the Rapid Clear Lotion and sometimes apply THAT product over this treatment.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would clear my acne.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t stop using it, it will clear up soon.</li>

            <li> I have sensitive, oily and acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> It also moisturizes my skin and makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I developed severe acne about 2 months ago</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my frequent cystic outbreaks or scarring.</li>
            <li> So far I got fewer pimples, but still do.</li>
            <li> As others reviews stated, being an adult with acne is a pain in the...</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that tends towards flakiness, redness and acne even in my forties</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried nearly every product on the market, OTC and prescription.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I think you&#x27;ll really like this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered for adult acne for about 6 years.</li>
            <li> and this is the only thing that really works.</li>
            <li> I usually prefer a product to have more strength than this one, but I am able to apply this multiple times per day without excessive dryness.</li>
            <li> WHO HAS FREQUENT BREAK-OUTS.</li>
            <li> After a few days of use it feels like this is making my skin oily even though it says oil free.</li>
            <li> and I must say I have noticed considerable difference in both skin and acne.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for any one with sensitive skin who have acne.</li>

            <li> As an adult, it amazes me that I&#x27;m still prone to breakouts.</li>

            <li> I did ask a few months later if it was working, and if so, did she need me to order more.</li>
            <li> I started with Proactive (useless!), moved to Clearsil (dries skin out too much), then to an herbal acne treatment (ineffective), and, finally, after reading all the great reviews, decided to try this product.</li>
            <li> When I stopped being able to find it locally, I tried a couple other salycylic acid products and none of them had the same performance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Firstly the description says it might make your face dry</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin when I first wash my face</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too strong (can&#x27;t handle Benzoyl Peroxide all over the face so much) but not too weak.</li>
            <li> Every time it would go away, the next day, some new pimples would come!</li>
            <li> Does anyone just use it as part of their regular skin routine - does it help improve already fairly decent combination skin?  </li>
            <li> this was the first product that I used that got rid of my facial acne and kept the acne from coming back.</li>
            <li> All through high school I struggled with acne and accepted it as teenage fate.</li>
            <li> It is very soothing if you have itchy or dry or sensitive skin, all of which I have.</li>
            <li> I usually use it before my (even light) moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Strangely, I also really like the smell --</li>
            <li> Normally, the issues occur in the same areas every month or so.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and moisturizing so it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my skin too much.  </li>
            <li> Even though sometimes I still need an extra boost of a heavier moisturizer, I only apply it around my dry spots like around my nose which is amazing since I used to put heavy moisturizers all over my face before I bought this product.</li>
            <li> It was reasonably priced and is one of the few things that really worked well for me.</li>
            <li> If you do this on a regular basis, then these after-mask-breakouts should decrease and stop, as long as you are consistent.</li>

            <li> This is not for acne, actually I didn&#x27;t see any good result, on the contrary it made it worse!</li>
            <li> Some of the acne subsided on its own but left behind marks.</li>
            <li> I was THIS close to biting the bullet and seeing a derm to get an Accutane presciption when I did a very general search on Amazon for &#x27;acne treatment&#x27; and looked at the highest reviewed products to see if I had missed something that I should try when I came across this product from Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> I used it diligently after washing my face each morning, and I could see major results within two weeks.</li>
            <li> We didn&#x27;t experience major breakout problems with this product, neither it helped preventing acnes.</li>
            <li> I usually use benzoyl peroxide lotions for those breakouts but those can be rough on my sensitive skin (redness, dryness), so I&#x27;m always looking for a better option.</li>
            <li> So I use it but not on major emergencies.</li>
            <li> So for people who have dry skin at first like me then turn into a greasy monster, give this product a definite go!</li>
            <li> I had always had clear skin and the sudden onset of acne without warning</li>
            <li> My skin is 90% clear, with the occasional breakout during my monthly.   </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak on the long term effects but if it helped this much over night I can only imagine after a week.</li>
            <li> and it feels like I&#x27;m just putting white clear cream on my face</li>
            <li> If you have scarring you will probably have to buy another cream for just that purpose, but if you got pimples only this product should clear it up</li>
            <li> recently switched to all natural products, so I won&#x27;t be using this anymore.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t matter if I was bare faced or wearing makeup or whether it was winter or summer.</li>
            <li> It is the adult way to manage &#x27;stress acne&#x27; - and everybody appreciates that there is currently certainly enough cause of this etiology of pimples!  </li>
            <li> I have seen marked improvements not only in acne</li>
            <li> even give me cortisone shots directly to some of the individual pimples of mine that have gone ballistic and become cysts.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Only drops on acnes needed with everytime usage, so it&#x27;s pretty long lasting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 16 year old male BTW</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I could ever go back to any old product I was using...</li>
            <li> It feels very lightweight, sinks in, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li> My skin had gone back to a 10 years old&#x27;s, before I had any problems with</li>
            <li> WIth other products, I usually would look fine in the morning after washing my face and then sometime around the afternoon my forehead would get as shiny as a mirror!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom Line: I will likely continue using it for another month or so along with the Argan Oil (new find for acne) that I recently purchased based on the recommendation of a friend and eliminating oil and sugar from my diet - hopefully, this will do the trick.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t want to live my life without, only wish they made a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive combination skin with oily t zone and dry skin on cheeks and near the lips.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s about finding the right balance, so she&#x27;ll try applying it a few times a week and see how that goes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Background: I have combination skin normally, but it&#x27;s been exceptionally dry this winter.</li>
            <li> I use it as just a moisturizer or if I&#x27;m feeling really dry, I use a normal moisturizer under it before putting on foundation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus my skin is never dry because it hydrates!</li>
            <li> I definitely did not get the positive results that other reviewers had.</li>
            <li> Fist step is this Neutrogena Acne Stress Control, an oil free cleanser that once applied to the frustrating marks, penetrates with the action of a salicylic peel followed by herbs and moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> I did try a few Salycilic Acid treatments as well during this period with more or less the same results.</li>
            <li> Cleans and does not dry out her face.</li>
            <li> After allowing the joy that all of youth is not banished then it is time to treat the little flaws without resorting to the old ways of thick coverup goos from the past.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and gets dry, but this medicine keeps your skin hydrated</li>
            <li> I first wash off with the scrub and then apply this stress control after a little bit.</li>
            <li> It has just the right amount of active ingredients and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out at all.  </li>
            <li> A little bit of dryness, but that was expected and it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li> The salicylic acid gently exfoliates and reduces both existing and previous blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Upon receiving my package, my expectations were slightly deflated as I noticed the treatment was seemed very . . .</li>
            <li> This stuff does not dry out my skin, but definitely helps keep the bumps at bay.</li>
            <li> Finally, it does not dry out my skin</li>
            <li> This is a gel-based lotion, whose main active ingredient is 2% salicylic acid.</li>
            <li> It may have helped clear my face some, but I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to see a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Something that also works well, OVERNIGHT, to dry them up on my son&#x27;s teenage and sensitive skin is [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing that takes care of my adult acne and doesn&#x27;t totally dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t work miracles but the &amp;#34;Acne Stress Control&amp;#34; line has brought my acne down to a more manageable level without irritating my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin so finding the right product that doesn&#x27;t cause to much dryness or to much oiliness is very difficult.</li>
            <li> I have a very stressful job and this little angel helped to keep those stress pimples away.</li>
            <li> as for acne control, it may have a little help, but not too much.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure how old this particular batch is.</li>
            <li> this product certainly did not work for me and even left a green gooey residue.</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t really have bad ache, have more oily skin with some some redness</li>
            <li> This product leaves skin soft and certainly not oily or greasy.  </li>
            <li> FYI, initially, when you do any oil-absorbing mask, be forewarned: you may get an intitial breakout a few days later, but don&#x27;t worry as this is normal.</li>
            <li> FYI, initially, when you do any oil-absorbing mask, be forewarned: you may get an intitial breakout a few days later, but don&#x27;t worry as this is normal.</li>
            <li> I have had problems with acne ever since high school, and I am one of those people who have tried every little thing to make it go away.</li>
            <li> I clean my face every night and put a thin layer of this stuff on</li>
            <li> Amazon has a good low cost version of this as well: [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> The last treatment that failed for me was a blue / red LED light therapy device which you were supposed to apply to your face every day.</li>
            <li> You have nothing to lose and a hell of a lot to gain, and this product flat out works.</li>
            <li> I use it as my BHA treatment daily, but my skin is on the dry side</li>
            <li> I began to use it twice a day, morning and night, but only after cleansing my skin beforehand and letting it dry for 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li> On a random note, the texture of this product is a bit watery and spreads easily over the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an inexpensive product to help control dry and oily skin look no further.</li>
            <li> Salycilic acid will exfoliate and achieve slightly different results, but it will also dry them up.</li>
            <li> But after 2 weeks you will notice less acne and acne will disappear completely if you keep using this every night.</li>
            <li> I broke out a lot this past year and looked frantically for something to help restore my face back to normal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even japanese guys, this is my personal advice to the world because I spent years trying to get rid of my acne.</li>
            <li> i can not live without it ( actually i can</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended it to a few friends &amp; they love it but also find it hard to track down.</li>
            <li> one being that I had tried other salycilic based products in the past without any results, but the consistently positive reviews and the low price convinced me to give it a shot.</li>
            <li> The only con is it is really small and kind of expensive considering the size.</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed that it felt different on my skin than other topical products.</li>
            <li> I used a couple other brands that either dried out and/or irritated my skin too much.  </li>
            <li> plain, old fashioned oatmeal!</li>
            <li> star - the product does not dry my skin out like other anti-acne medications</li>
            <li> This was even better and the thought of having to search again for something that works is so disappointing.</li>
            <li> It is a light lotion that smells vaguely of cucumber.</li>
            <li> Look, my whole family has always suffered from acne, it sucks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m stocking up while it&#x27;s still around, which I hope it is for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m washing my face with Neutrogena pink grape fruit facial wash before I put this on.</li>
            <li> Because it has become harder to find at local stores, I buy in bulk on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Minor issue, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Granted, my face is not completely</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not nearly as oily as I used to be.</li>
            <li> This is just a minor issue with this treatment, but I was hoping it would get rid of that</li>
            <li> I use it on a daily basis and the skin drying effects are minimal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I got it, I can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash Facial Cleanser, Pink Grapefruit, 6 Ounce]].</li>
            <li> In the first couple of days my acnes actually got worse, but I knew it was how acid would work on my face</li>
            <li> But then ever since I tried this, I noticed that the existing pimples got less red and got a bit smaller.</li>
            <li> so I usually need a pretty heavy moisturizer for the dryness to go away, but then after a few hours my face gets super oily which sucks.</li>
            <li> love this stuff, so mad they stopped making it</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s no longer under extreme stress as before, so that definitely helped as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> in 1.. where as other products on their line only has one.. or two..</li>
            <li> The areas that were dry stopped itching.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin, and it reduces redness.  </li>
            <li> There was no burning or tingling sensation whatsoever, and it didn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> I pat my face lightly to dry my skin.  </li>
            <li> I used to use 2in1 acne med by neutrogena which makes your face dry</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t make your skin dry.</li>
            <li> They tend to dry my skin out to the point of flaking after 3 uses.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry your face out either.</li>
            <li> though - my skin never felt dry or taut.</li>
            <li> When having to use an acne medication I was worried about flaking dry skin.</li>
            <li> There are days when I feel like I can skip my moisturizer and my face doesn&#x27;t get dry at all.</li>
            <li> didn;t help acne or blackheads or whiteheads at all, even feel dry and winkles after applying it,</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry up my face.</li>
            <li> My face was still dry even though the bottles claims to moisturize as well as get rid of blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my skin at all, and I use it once</li>
            <li> I now have acne under control &amp; only 2-3 active pimples when I used to have like 15-20 all over my face.</li>
            <li> no new pimples have arrived yet in the area that I have applied this.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product and guaranteed you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having adult acne for the past 2 years</li>
            <li> Of course, it was near my mouth, between my lip and cheek, as usual.  </li>
            <li> so i ordered this as an emergency, and within 5 days of using i was almost clear, and haven&#x27;t gotten a single pimple emerge since then,  I&#x27;m disappointed this product isn&#x27;t available in any of the stores in my city or cities nearby</li>
            <li> Smelt pretty bad, didn&#x27;t do much and just didn&#x27;t seem to suit my skin type.</li>
            <li> I also have combination skin, and in the areas where I break out, after using one time, became less red.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had issues with acne and angry skin for years (I&#x27;m 39 now), and this is the first product that has made such a difference.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to pay $100 for a product that was only half working.</li>
            <li> ,small acne only stay on my face for one night and then gone in the next day morning.</li>
            <li> but in much less volume for the same price.</li>
            <li> The harsh winter season didn&#x27;t help my cause and resulted in both acne and dry skin at the same time!</li>
            <li> It will dry your skin out and it comes in an extremely small tube so it wont last long at all for the price.</li>
            <li> The only down side is that if you use it morning and night you skin will peel, so pick one or the other.</li>
            <li> Other spot blemish products I&#x27;ve used have tended to dry out the skin around the break out and well didn&#x27;t look all that nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry up my skin like some other salicylic acid products.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> , after not being able to find it in stores for around 3 years, I have painful cystic acne, and wake up to whiteheads no matter what.</li>
            <li> I have complex skin and only get acnes occasionally during cycles.</li>
            <li> I bought several hoping it would last me at least a year.</li>
            <li> I felt the pimple coming, I used the product as a spot treatment a few times a day, and sure enough it never reared it ugly</li>
            <li> $30 and appeared to have been partially used.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few days and noticed a clearer face.</li>
            <li> Now, while this is messy, and something you will want to do over your kitchen sink, it is what I keep going back to even after trying fancy-shmancy store-bought concoctions.</li>
            <li> my face dried out and was red and blotchy.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not crazy expensive either/</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why some people said it&#x27;s sticky when it&#x27;s really not</li>
            <li> I hate unscrewing it, putting the product on my fingers and then unsuccessfully trying to screw the top back on.  </li>
            <li> Awhile back I was extremely stressed out and had quite a few breakouts around my mouth</li>
            <li> With 4 kids that one little modification would help me out as I wouldnt have to put down the bottle, put on the gel, wipe off my hands and then put the cap back on (all while hoping one of the toddlers doesnt grab the bottle!  </li>
            <li> Bought this product based on review by Paula Begoun and have been using it for a little less than a week, but my acne (and related redness/irritation) is almost gone.  </li>
            <li> It does leave my skin a little dry, but I expected that.  </li>
            <li> I initially had very little faith in it working since it is a salicylic acid treatment...</li>
            <li> Exfoliants (like salicylic acid) help to remove dead skin cells, making pores less likely to clog.</li>
            <li> After one use, my skin felt tight and it was so dry.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t sting or make my skin all dry and tight like some other products do.</li>
            <li> so sometimes it&#x27;s every other day.  </li>
            <li> Other treatments and cleansers didn&#x27;t seem to keep the issues away.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use any other products afterwards, not even a moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> others have pointed out, this product was actually discontinued by Neutrogena over the past year or so.</li>
            <li> I feel like its other users: how could I do without it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff but it seems to be discontinued:(</li>
            <li> Even though I am past my teenage years I still struggle with breakouts.</li>
            <li> and when I put it on any other part of my face</li>
            <li> I have been breaking out a lot and not sure if this is actually helping yet.</li>
            <li> After trying a couple of other products I was about to give up</li>
            <li> My hubby has extremely oily skin and tends to have breakouts from time to time, and Neutrogena helps control the breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only con about this product is the small 2 oz size</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t determine whether this works for me as an acne control since I use other products in conjunction to this one.</li>
            <li> I love this product and am so disappointed it has been taken off the market.</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;m not allergic to salicylic acid because I&#x27;ve used that a lot before in other products, but this does list silicones and dyes in the ingredient list.</li>
            <li> so I bought 6 tube, paying $7 for 3 of them and $3.50 for the other 3.  </li>
            <li> I use this maybe every other day.  </li>
            <li> or I&#x27;m under extreme amounts of stress.</li>
            <li> Although I do still get a little dry if I use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> I was a little confused at first if it was a treatment or moisterizer, but it&#x27;s a little of both.</li>
            <li> this uses salicylic acid at a 2% concentration as the active ingredient.</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin and can&#x27;t use regular moisturizers or else I break out like crazy.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using it just because I didn&#x27;t have time and was traveling a lot, and now my nose got worse again, so I will definitely go back to using this regularly.</li>
            <li> I was tired of having to apply several different products.</li>
            <li> and if I use it everyday, the break out is limited.</li>
            <li> The tiny hard pimples have vanished.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only thing is, why is this so hard to find?  </li>
            <li> I am having a hard time finding it...come back!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne prone skin over the years, especially when I was a teenager but even as an adult if I wash my face with the wrong product I&#x27;ll break out a little bit.</li>
            <li> In the two weeks that I&#x27;ve used it, it has cleared up my acne and clogged pores without making my skin dry and flaky like other stronger acne medications I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> I used this product everyday for the past 4 months, twice a day religiously, but did not see any improvement at all.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that fragrance is added.  </li>
            <li> This just in, you know the facts  People on average, people look for any ways to get there way, cause they care</li>
            <li> only complaint is that the tube has a screw-on cap rather than a flip cap.</li>
            <li> I kept looking and it turns out that it can be bought (at least currently) on the Neurtogena website</li>
            <li> and I definitely see improvement, my acne is slowly going away and the redness is going away as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently ordered it on Amazon, and my skin is slowly making it&#x27;s way to</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to get every last drop out of my tube right now :(</li>
            <li> My breakouts have calmed down.</li>
            <li> Now I use other stuff like tretinoin...with tons of sun protection of course!</li>
            <li> After I used this product my acne became very small red spot  </li>
            <li> far I&#x27;m three weeks in and after a very small initial outbreak, I&#x27;ve had a dramatic reduction in my acne.</li>
            <li> I went through it in less than a month, using it day and night.</li>
            <li> We have oddly greasy skin and rosacea runs in our family.</li>
            <li> Decent product, but not perfect.  </li>
            <li> star - the product has not produced any uncomfortable of unexpected side effects (in other words, it hasn&#x27;t made my acne worse)&lt;br</li>
            <li> There was less in the bottle than I had been expecting, but that&#x27;s not a huge deal.</li>
            <li> This product leaves your skin a little matte look.  </li>
            <li> Not even a little bit.</li>
            <li> I know there can be a \\&quot;purging\\&quot; period when you switch products, but I usually get traditional whiteheads when that happens and not these weird numerous bumps under my skin.</li>
            <li> I just wish I had found this product earlier, as my previous bout of acne has left behind quite a few marks on my face that are healing very, very slowly.</li>
            <li> Although this treatment isn&#x27;t irritating or drying, it isn&#x27;t especially hydrating; I still must use Cerave moisturizer afterward.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s worse than teenage acne?</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve convinced a few people on the fence to go out and give this product a shot.</li>
            <li> This lotion moisterizes my skin for a few hours before I have to reapply.</li>
            <li> My pre-teen daughter has been dealing with acne around her T-zone for a few months.</li>
            <li> If you are having trouble with pesky acne, I&#x27;d say to give this a shot.</li>
            <li> also take 100% organic Spirulina and chlorella green food tablets</li>
            <li> I have been using it twice a day, once at night, and in the morning for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> A thin application daily helps prevent ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> A few years ago, I found this neurtogena acne product</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t waste any of it.</li>
            <li> and my face had a few breakouts while I was out of it.  </li>
            <li> I just get broken out around my mouth and only on occasion.  </li>
            <li> When I bought neutrogena, after few days I already see my acne dessapear&#x3D;D</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on it.</li>
            <li> I normally get white heads, black heads and stupid little pimples around my nostrils.</li>
            <li> Thus, began the long and painful process of trying a series of new products.</li>
            <li> the black heads are gone, the white heads seem like theyre rising to the surface, soon to be removed and my little pimples around the nostrils are gone!!!!</li>
            <li> Big sloppy kisses to Neutrogena for making this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a strong smell</li>
            <li> I tried proactive in the past for those trouble some pimples</li>
            <li> Keep in mind my &amp;#34;breakouts&amp;#34; are only maybe one or two but very big and painful bumps.</li>
            <li> (up to 6 or 7 large painful cystic type around my mouth/cheek areas).  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical for numerous reasons,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small knock given the unrivaled work it does on preventing breakouts, and even with the marks on my face</li>
            <li> Not sure why.</li>
            <li> bottle is so small.</li>
            <li> and I am not sure if that has a play in it</li>
            <li> and I found it here for about double the retail price (sad face).  </li>
            <li> (I started out using this product with about 3 or 4 small pimples that were gone in two days of use, three times per day.)</li>
            <li> So buy up as much as possible and send them angry letters for discontinuing it.</li>
            <li> like the stress control gel because it doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin, doesn&#x27;t leave a film on the skin and isn&#x27;t messy or difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> how thin and liquidy the green stuff is, it&#x27;ll get in your pores and make your skin so oddly baby-smooth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of facial moisturizers and have been really unhappy with them because it always leave my face greasy or it feels heavy.  </li>
            <li> which is why I decided to write a review letting anyone who may be desperately searching like I was that you don&#x27;t have to pay a ridiculously inflated price (at least for now while Neutrogena is still selling it directly).  </li>
            <li> It did reduce skin redness and it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but for some reason it made my acne worse a lot worse.</li>
            <li> Whenever I see this, I buy two because it seems to be hard to find sometimes - WalMart, CVS, and Target</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;ll be hard for you not to touch your face and for anyone who does also, to not touch it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just devastated that this is so hard to find--</li>
            <li> it on at least 2-3 times a day.</li>
            <li> Smells like watermelon, or at least mines do anyways.</li>
            <li> I started using it in my late 20&#x27;s and wish it was around when I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> Cutting back on sweets and greasy processed foods seemed to help, but my acne remained an annoyance.</li>
            <li> At least they seem to help.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having hormonal acne lately</li>
            <li> ): Make it at least 6 ox</li>
            <li> This is not like proactive done expect to wake up and for it to be gone, you have to apply it at LEAST 2 times a day</li>
            <li> I have been trying to manage my acne for at least a decade.  </li>
            <li> So give it at least until you run out of your bottle.</li>
            <li> really, don&#x27;t use this crap.</li>
            <li> Usually I when I have acne it showed up with big red area around acne that made my face look terrible.</li>
            <li> but I would not recommend this product for anyone with sensitive skin :(</li>
            <li> I was getting to the point where I was convinced that my diet had to be the culprit because of the timing of my outbreaks generally following a day in which I ate something particularly bad.</li>
            <li> I almost never break out now and if I do, it&#x27;s brief and not too bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sad to see that it&#x27;s not available anywhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m at the bottom  of the bottle now, and I am disappointed but maybe this product is not targeted towards my Asian, combination skin.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s quite expensive for that small amount.</li>
            <li> now i pay close to ten :(</li>
            <li> dont have a problem with large break outs, but when I got on the Nova Ring, I broke out horribly like never before.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unnecessary, and potentially irritating.</li>
            <li> that I am annoyed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced dryness or irritation.</li>
            <li> Nothing seemed to work and my face became so broken out</li>
            <li> I would advise for you to get this if you have annoying red acne.</li>
            <li> Well, this counters my annoying red acne!</li>
            <li> so I thought that this might help but it just made it worse</li>
            <li> Due to a medication I am on my face keeps breaking out around my mouth and the acne I am getting is EXTREMELY painful, in addition to not looking well</li>
            <li> but every so often I have a few really bad cysts.</li>
            <li> Very hard to find in stores!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this didn&#x27;t help with my blemishes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a miserable feeling not wanting to look somebody in the eye or trying to avoid showing your face in public, and you feel helpless when nothing you try seems to work.</li>
            <li> i think it made it worse!</li>
            <li> I personally hate this item, I feel like its a waste of money, but I guess it just wasnt for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really sad that Neutrogena decided to not make it again.  </li>
            <li> The acne seems to get worst at my mid cycle during the month</li>
            <li> If you want something to target a random pimple, this gel is not the strongest and you may want to get a targeted cream or gel.  </li>
            <li> Well with the try for troubled skin, please with results.  </li>
            <li> I was so sad when I couldn&#x27;t find this stuff in the stores anymore</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I couldn&#x27;t find this anywhere and emailed Neutrogena to see what was going on.  </li>
            <li> My acne isn&#x27;t terrible, but it does flare up occasionally.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thin</li>
            <li> But, this does nothing for me other than dries me out terribly, and causes my skin to look flaky.</li>
            <li> and I started breaking out on my skin and neck like crazy.</li>
            <li> I know how difficult, painful and depressing bad acne can be, hopefully this product will work for others as well as it has for me.lps some out,</li>
            <li> I know how difficult, painful and depressing bad acne can be, hopefully this product will work for others as well as it has for me.</li>
            <li> I hate all the girly and EXPENSIVE face washes on here.</li>
            <li> I have been told it tastes bad, though.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had problems with this bad of acne for a couple years now</li>
            <li> She gets bad breakouts when it&#x27;s that time of the month</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as the others.</li>
            <li> and I broke out so bad.</li>
            <li> Too bad they don&#x27;t sell it in stores in the US any longer.  </li>
            <li> The majority of the stuff out there either doesn&#x27;t work or dries your face out badly.</li>
            <li> i had some bad acne appeared the 2 week before school</li>
            <li> but then it just broke me up so bad</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since my skin has never been bad, I can&#x27;t say that it has drastically improved or anything of the sort.</li>
            <li> It was painful, but I kept up with the treatment and also added a spot medicine as well, I used Avons spot treatment -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad that Neutrogena discontinued this product 2 years ago :(</li>
            <li> Extremely expensive too for this horrible skin care product.</li>
            <li> I am sooo disappointed that Neurtogena is discontinuing it from this line.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate feeling like my face is greasy after lotion</li>
            <li> I am incredibly disappointed that it has been out of stock!</li>
            <li> At it&#x27;s worst</li>
            <li> Granted, I have terrible skin anyway,</li>
            <li> When I was in 11th grade, suffering some of the worst skin in my life.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years, and it&#x27;s about the best product I&#x27;ve found for controlling my incessantly oily skin.  Nothing will stop the flow of oil (which keeps me looking much younger than my 60 years), but I highly recommend this product as something that does as good a job as anything else and treats my skin kindly.</li>
            <li> This is really good stuff, don&#x27;t understand why Neutrogena no longer makes it, I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.  I wished I had brought it before now.  I originally thought it was for younger people but I see where those in my age range (50s) and women with menopausal acne have good results.  Helps with controlling blackheads. When I get a bump it decreases the redness and heals it quick.  I use it as my BHA treatment daily, but my skin is on the dry side so sometimes it&#x27;s every other day.  I don&#x27;t need much, so looks like it will last me a good while.  It needs to come back.</li>
            <li> clear your acne ,this one works ,and  very light very nice smell .i think i will buy again some day</li>
            <li> Feels great by being a gel.  Make-up goes on smooth over it.  Very effective results.  I would continue to order this.</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders on my acne and doesnt make me me more sun-sensitive. The only con is it is really small and kind of expensive considering the size.</li>
            <li> After reading the excellent reviews I had to try this product for myself. As said this product is amazing and I am happy with the results. My zits are gone and my acne is disappearing right before my eyes. I used to always get zits alot especially when I wear makeup and none of the acne and zit products/medications ever worked for me, but after using this product I have not seen a zit in sight and the ones I felt coming in have disappeared and my acne is going away as well. This is an amazing product and guaranteed you won&#x27;t be disappointed. I have yet to miss a day putting this suff on and i put&lt;br /&gt; it on at least 2-3 times a day. Also to the smell is amazing! Smells like watermelon, or at least mines do anyways. When I start to run out I will most definitely  come back and order some more.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff. I&#x27;ve had acne prone skin over the years, especially when I was a teenager but even as an adult if I wash my face with the wrong product I&#x27;ll break out a little bit. This stuff glide on smooth. No heavy rubbing in. Did not irritate my skin and I noticed a difference the next morning (I use it at night).</li>
            <li> love this stuff, so mad they stopped making it</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product! There was less in the bottle than I had been expecting, but that&#x27;s not a huge deal. It was shipped in good time, and arrived in good shape.    The product itself is one to rave about. It is very soothing if you have itchy or dry or sensitive skin, all of which I have. I also have combination skin, and in the areas where I break out, after using one time, became less red. The areas that were dry stopped itching. I can&#x27;t say that it did the absolute best job on keeping my acne away, but just making it less red is an achievement in itself with my skin.     Overall, I&#x27;d definitely suggest this to a friend. I&#x27;m actually ordering the entire system when I get a chance, to see if it works best when used with the other products.</li>
            <li> I am an Asian female with moderate acne, specifically on the cheek areas. I started getting acne during sophomore year of college, at 19. Now, I am turning 23. I definitely did not get the positive results that other reviewers had. I used this product everyday for the past 4 months, twice a day religiously, but did not see any improvement at all. But, it did not worsen my skin either. I&#x27;m at the bottom  of the bottle now, and I am disappointed but maybe this product is not targeted towards my Asian, combination skin.</li>
            <li> Obviously, everyone is different. I have sensitive, oily and acne-prone skin. Most of my breakouts though are hormonal. Even though I know that most topical products do nothing for hormonal acne, I thought this might help because of the words &amp;#34;stress control&amp;#34; in the name. Unfortunately, this didn&#x27;t help with my blemishes. I don&#x27;t think my skin likes salicylic acid because it never seems to improve when I used products that contain it. I was hoping this would be different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product for almost two months and didn&#x27;t see any changes in the frequency or amount of breakouts on my skin. I do love the consistency and smell and it is pretty good at keeping skin moisturized too, so that&#x27;s a plus. It just doesn&#x27;t seem to be good for cystic hormonal breakouts. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I use this product as a spot treatment in the morning rather than to spread over my whole face, mostly because I&#x27;m prone to very dry skin.  After about a week of use, most of my acne has cleared up.  This stuff is a clear gel, and goes on clear without leaving a residue so you can use it in the morning if you want to.  I don&#x27;t find that it has a scent at all.  I also haven&#x27;t found that it dries out my skin on the spots that I put it on so I&#x27;m pretty happy about that.  Overall I like this product but I&#x27;m sure it wouldn&#x27;t work well for everyone - if you have really stubborn acne you&#x27;ll probably want to get something else.</li>
            <li> I have a very stressful job and this little angel helped to keep those stress pimples away.</li>
            <li> In addition to keeping my pores clear, this salicylic acid preparation has worked better than finacea (azelaic acid) at reducing my skin&#x27;s (especially my nose&#x27;s) redness, which is caused by rosacea.  In fact, my red spells have virtually disappeared since I started using this product.  Additionally, the acne stress control lotion is the only salicylic acid preparation I could find that does not contain significant amounts of alcohol, which irritates my skin. (Most preparations are solutions rather than emulsions or suspensions, and thus alcohol is required to dissolve the salicylic acid, which is not water soluble.)    Although this treatment isn&#x27;t irritating or drying, it isn&#x27;t especially hydrating; I still must use Cerave moisturizer afterward.  However, I would much rather use a non-moisturizing treatment and then add my preferred level of moisture on top, than use a treatment that is too heavy.  My only complaint is that fragrance is added.  It&#x27;s unnecessary, and potentially irritating.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and really liked it. this product has worked well for me. It clears up my acne. It also moisturizes my skin and makes my skin soft. it contains salycic acid. it does not contain benzoyle peroxide which has bleached my towels, clothes, and hair when i have used it. this product has helped treat acne for me.</li>
            <li> I tried the Olay kit and did not like that at all. This oil free line from Neutrogena is great and costs less than the olay kit.  I use the wash daily (scrub once a week), toner daily and the hydrating cream daily. It&#x27;s a good combo and decent price. Since it&#x27;s not a kit, you can just buy what you need and when so that is nice too.</li>
            <li> Love this product--I am 41 and generally have great skin aside from annoying acne breakouts on my chin.  Bought this product based on review by Paula Begoun and have been using it for a little less than a week, but my acne (and related redness/irritation) is almost gone.  I also have keratosis pilaris on my upper arms, and 3 days ago read that using a salicylic acid treatment, such as this Neutrogena product, could help. In the last 3 days, I&#x27;ve been using this Neutrogena Hydrating Acne Treatment on my upper arms, and the difference is remarkable. I would give this product 10 stars if I could.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s worse than teenage acne? Adult acne!! I developed severe acne about 2 months ago and I have no idea why. I had always had clear skin and the sudden onset of acne without warning was a real shocker. I started with Proactive (useless!), moved to Clearsil (dries skin out too much), then to an herbal acne treatment (ineffective), and, finally, after reading all the great reviews, decided to try this product. I have been using it for about a month, so it is possible that the product will eventually deliver the results others claim it is possible of delivering. The reasons for my rating are given below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 star - the product does not dry my skin out like other anti-acne medications do (e.g. Clearsil)&lt;br /&gt;1 star - it has minimized the redness of my acne breakouts (that even Proactiv could not accomplish)&lt;br /&gt;1 star - the product is reasonably priced&lt;br /&gt;1 star - the product has not produced any uncomfortable of unexpected side effects (in other words, it hasn&#x27;t made my acne worse)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Docked 1 star because the product does not seem to help with minimizing breakouts or reducing the severity or duration of breakouts, which is kind of its purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: I will likely continue using it for another month or so along with the Argan Oil (new find for acne) that I recently purchased based on the recommendation of a friend and eliminating oil and sugar from my diet - hopefully, this will do the trick. Will update if the product ends up delivering on its promise after all!!</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my frequent cystic outbreaks or scarring.</li>
            <li> * Neutrogena Acne for stress worked great for me  * Acne clears up in 2-3 days.  * Not drying on my skin  * Would recommend to others  * Otherwise the Clean&amp;Clear Acne Gel, for oil skin.</li>
            <li> I got this based on great reviews.  I usually use it before my (even light) moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve been having adult acne for the past 2 years that I am annoyed.  I found that Neutrogena products work best for my skin.    This product leaves your skin a little matte look.  It absorbs to the skin very quickly.  So, for some people it might not be enough to use by itself as moisturizer.  I also use the cleaning pad and sunscreen from neutrogena.  So far I got fewer pimples, but still do.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get much moisture from this product, but it did reduce redness. It may have helped clear my face some, but I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to see a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently switched to all natural products, so I won&#x27;t be using this anymore. But if you&#x27;re okay with using these things, go for it. It does work. But at what cost?</li>
            <li> This works great for exfoliation, preventing and treating acne.</li>
            <li> Break out Cure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for before, during and after your menstral cycle and during weather changes and balancing skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont have a problem with large break outs, but when I got on the Nova Ring, I broke out horribly like never before.  This saved me.  SCORE!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product.  It helps but isn&#x27;t as drying as most of these types of acne creams are.....and it has a nice smell whereas most acne products stink.  Service ws quick and came undamaged because it was well-packed.</li>
            <li> This just in, you know the facts  People on average, people look for any ways to get there way, cause they care bout them selves, millions of dollars, the companies got, so i was part of it to, not everything works, so yeah,  i have low acne, and i use it, and i got a little more,  but whatever, just buy it, i wont recommend this product, and i dont like it.</li>
            <li> This stuff seems to be working well for me. I am 44 and have had acne issues off and on since puberty. This stuff does not dry out my skin, but definitely helps keep the bumps at bay. I have tried a lot of products, and this one has been the best bang for my buck!</li>
            <li> Spent so much money trying to find the best face wash to clear up my unwanted zits. This product worked way quicker and better than any others I tried, including Proactive.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money. Did not work for me at all! I fell for the reviews and bought 3 case of these and all were nothing but trash. it also feels sticky like glue.</li>
            <li> I love love LOVE this product and only ordered it off Amazon once it went missing in local stores here&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a great job of keeping your skin clear and very soft. Make sure to use foundation or some light sunscreen with it as it doesn&#x27;t have the SPF. I would recommend this to anyone who looks for something lightweight, feels great and wants to keep pimples from popping up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*My skin is prone to breakouts and this keeps them to a minimum! When I get giant zits I do need to use a more heavy duty zit cream*</li>
            <li> I am absolutely amazed by the results of this product. As others reviews stated, being an adult with acne is a pain in the... I have tried a lot of different products and this one is the best by far.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference. I gave it a shot, but it just seem like it did nothing. Not even a little bit.</li>
            <li> I love this acne gel, it is my very favorite! I can&#x27;t buy it anymore except on the internet. I buy like 3 or 4 at a time. I fear this product is being phased out or something. If you are middle-aged like me and have acne-prone skin, this is the bomb. It works and does not irritate. It is the best acne gel I could find and I have tried them all.</li>
            <li> my skin feels good after using this product, help with the acne, and hydrating all the time~ the price is good too</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak highly enough about this product. I started using it in my late 20&#x27;s and wish it was around when I was a teenager. WIth other products, I usually would look fine in the morning after washing my face and then sometime around the afternoon my forehead would get as shiny as a mirror! It didn&#x27;t matter if I was bare faced or wearing makeup or whether it was winter or summer. WIth this product, my face looks very healthy and even. I even stopped wearing makeup. I don&#x27;t need it anymore.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older, I&#x27;ve had issues breaking out along the chin.  Normally, the issues occur in the same areas every month or so.  Other treatments and cleansers didn&#x27;t seem to keep the issues away.  I purchased the product on Amazon, and after receiving it in October 2011, I promptly started to use it.  At first I used it morning and night and experienced no adverse effects, and when I didn&#x27;t break out any more I was pretty impressed.  I&#x27;ve cut back to once per day (evening) given the lack of break outs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product really does hydrate your skin.  Other spot blemish products I&#x27;ve used have tended to dry out the skin around the break out and well didn&#x27;t look all that nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy again and again.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I am a 24 year who has suffered from acne for years.  I have tried dozens of products, supplements and diets without success.  That is until I discovered Neutrogena Acne Stress Control Hydrating Acne treatment.  I usually do not review products, but I was amazed by the results I got from this acne treatment. After 6 weeks of use, my acne is 95% improved. I use it twice a day after cleansing my face.  It doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin, and it reduces redness.  I am so happy I got this product. If you suffer from continuous pimples like I used to, please try this product.  It&#x27;s truly amazing.</li>
            <li> I am in my 20&#x27;s and have struggled with mild/moderate acne and oily skin for 10+ years. I am currently using Differin, and discovered that although it helps to regenerate skin cells, it is not an exfoliant. Exfoliants (like salicylic acid) help to remove dead skin cells, making pores less likely to clog. Acne Stress control has the appropriate amount of salicylic acid, along with the right pH for best exfoliation. I decided to add this product, as well as benzyl peroxide for disinfection ([[ASIN:B000052YJL Clean &amp; Clear Persa-Gel 10, Maximum Strength 1]]), and have not had any whiteheads or red pumps since. All three products are drying, but I use Differin and this product at night, and benzyl peroxide in the morning. I did experience some dryness for the first week, and just skip the benzyl peroxide if my skin is too irritated. I also use [[ASIN:B000YJ2SLG CeraVe Lotion, Moisturizing, 12 oz.]] (the body lotion has the same ingredients as the \\&quot;special face\\&quot; lotion, but is much cheaper), and a gentle cleanser. My skin has never looked better. This routine has also improved the oiliness of my skin.     Much of this information I got from Paula&#x27;s Choice [...]. She has great advice on skin care products, and the best products in the drug store.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin which can be more oily or dry, depending on the season, with occasional hormone-related breakouts. I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena&#x27;s Acne Stress Control gel for about three years. It&#x27;s my favorite BHA product for a number of reasons. I use it primarily to keep my skin smooth and soft, which it does with only occasional use, but it also noticeably helps to prevent pimples and gets rid of milia quickly. The scent is light. It goes on smoothly and is absorbed into the skin, leaving no stickiness or shine. I&#x27;ve never experienced dryness or irritation. I have been told it tastes bad, though. And it&#x27;s only 2% salicylic acid, so it may not be strong enough for someone with moderate-to-severe acne.</li>
            <li> Whenever I see this, I buy two because it seems to be hard to find sometimes - WalMart, CVS, and Target have stopped carrying it. Hopefully it isn&#x27;t being discontinued because this stuff is THE BEST! The beta-hydroxy acid in this really works - it penetrates pores to really get the job done, but isn&#x27;t too drying .. or too oily. The formulation is actually great - very lightweight, almost like a serum; it feels like nothing on your skin.  I have sensitive skin that tends towards flakiness, redness and acne even in my forties but this stuff really works to keep my face looking great. It looks smoother, brighter, clearer, more even-toned and less red.   I don&#x27;t ever want to be without this product!</li>
            <li> Aging skin on aging (maturing!) people gets a bit of a boost when that morning mirror spotlights those little red spots that appear spontaneously, reminding the wearer that acne is not a teenage disease!  After allowing the joy that all of youth is not banished then it is time to treat the little flaws without resorting to the old ways of thick coverup goos from the past.  There are two fine steps to take.  Fist step is this Neutrogena Acne Stress Control, an oil free cleanser that once applied to the frustrating marks, penetrates with the action of a salicylic peel followed by herbs and moisturizers.  It leaves the affected skin feeling fresh and a bit tingly and preps that areas for completion of treatment with Neutrogena&#x27;s Rapid Clear.  It is the adult way to manage &#x27;stress acne&#x27; - and everybody appreciates that there is currently certainly enough cause of this etiology of pimples!  Grady Harp, June 11</li>
            <li> Over the last year I&#x27;d developed a fairly persistent case of mild acne. Not nearly as bad as some, but enough to shake my confidence and severely impact my social life. I tried many different things to fix it with limited success, including products like Proactiv, Acne Free, and even the very highly reviewed &#x27;Regimen&#x27; from Acne.org. Benzoyl Peroxide for whatever reason just doesn&#x27;t seem to like my skin very much. I did try a few Salycilic Acid treatments as well during this period with more or less the same results. I also tried various pills that had good feedback from acne sufferers. I was getting to the point where I was convinced that my diet had to be the culprit because of the timing of my outbreaks generally following a day in which I ate something particularly bad. Cutting back on sweets and greasy processed foods seemed to help, but my acne remained an annoyance. The last treatment that failed for me was a blue / red LED light therapy device which you were supposed to apply to your face every day. I didn&#x27;t see any improvement and it ended up being a huge waste of time and money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I was starting to lose hope. It&#x27;s a miserable feeling not wanting to look somebody in the eye or trying to avoid showing your face in public, and you feel helpless when nothing you try seems to work. I was THIS close to biting the bullet and seeing a derm to get an Accutane presciption when I did a very general search on Amazon for &#x27;acne treatment&#x27; and looked at the highest reviewed products to see if I had missed something that I should try when I came across this product from Neutrogena. I had never heard of it before or seen it in stores, and reading the description I didn&#x27;t know what exactly it was. I was skeptical for numerous reasons, one being that I had tried other salycilic based products in the past without any results, but the consistently positive reviews and the low price convinced me to give it a shot. What&#x27;s one more product at this point, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first put it on my skin I immediately noticed that it felt different on my skin than other topical products. There was no burning or tingling sensation whatsoever, and it didn&#x27;t dry my skin out. I began to use it twice a day, morning and night, but only after cleansing my skin beforehand and letting it dry for 10-15 minutes. I didn&#x27;t use any other products afterwards, not even a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;m three weeks in and after a very small initial outbreak, I&#x27;ve had a dramatic reduction in my acne. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s reduced my outbreaks by around 90%, which is a remarkable improvement. Every day I&#x27;ve waited for my acne to show back up and every day my face looks better than the day before. It&#x27;s a great, great feeling. I just wish I had found this product earlier, as my previous bout of acne has left behind quite a few marks on my face that are healing very, very slowly. On that note, I have to say that the product doesn&#x27;t seem to be all that effective at diminishing scars, marks, and hyperpigmentation as a result of acne. It&#x27;s a small knock given the unrivaled work it does on preventing breakouts, and even with the marks on my face I&#x27;m feeling as good about myself as I have since before I ever had acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have pointed out, this product was actually discontinued by Neutrogena over the past year or so. Fortunately, it can still be found online via Amazon and other sites, including Neutrogena&#x27;s own website (where it&#x27;s actually slightly cheaper to buy than from the vendors who list it here on Amazon). I&#x27;m stocking up while it&#x27;s still around, which I hope it is for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully I&#x27;ve convinced a few people on the fence to go out and give this product a shot. You have nothing to lose and a hell of a lot to gain, and this product flat out works.</li>
            <li> As a 21 year old male with light acne for the past 6 years, this is my favorite acne treatment product.  I&#x27;ve tried nearly every product on the market, OTC and prescription.  It&#x27;s lightweight and moisturizing so it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my skin too much.  If dryness is a problem your you, I highly recommend [[ASIN:B0009F3O22 Neutrogena Rapid Clear Acne Defense Face Lotion 1.7 Fluid Ounce (50 ml)]].  I prefer the active ingredient Salicylic Acid over products containing benzoyl peroxide because it doesn&#x27;t bleach fabrics and works better for me personally.  This product leaves skin soft and certainly not oily or greasy.  Remember different skin types respond to different treatments, so search until you find what works best for you.  In my experience, it works best at preventing new acne so I lightly apply it to my problem areas in the morning after washing my face.  For spot treating, I recommend [[ASIN:B00027D6SE Bye Bye Blemish Drying Lotion - 1 fl oz]] before bed which also has great reviews and I&#x27;ve had success with.  Overall, I think you&#x27;ll really like this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is just plain amazing. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months and I&#x27;m almost done with my 2nd bottle. My skin is 90% clear, with the occasional breakout during my monthly.   I&#x27;ve suffered for adult acne for about 6 years. At it&#x27;s worst I would call it moderate to severe, ranging from 20-25 pimples at a time. Mostly deep acne bumps in my chin and jawline and hormonal acne.  I have a routine:  *I wash with this face wash most mornings and every night before bed with OLAY FOAMING FACE WASH in the blue pump bottle.  *I pat my face lightly to dry my skin.  *I apply THIS Neutrogena Acne Stress Control Hydrating Acne Treatment.  *I spot treat at night after the Neutrogena with Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s spot treatment using a q-tip. This stuff is amazing, shrinking my breakouts 70% overnight.   If you are suffering from acne, most experts will tell you the wash isn&#x27;t where you need your Benzoyl Peroxide or Salicylic Acid, it&#x27;s your toner and moisturizer where you need your acne treatment.</li>
            <li> Firstly the description says it might make your face dry but it doesn&#x27;t so it&#x27;s good. I used to use 2in1 acne med by neutrogena which makes your face dry but wit this one my face look awesome.I&#x27;m washing my face with Neutrogena pink grape fruit facial wash before I put this on. This combination is working really well for me. I&#x27;m so happy I found something that works on my acne.</li>
            <li> I have tried EVERYTHING for my acne(acnefree, Olay, clay masks, etc.) and this is the only thing that really works. i have used t for about 3 weeks. And It helps clear up acne quickly!!(2-3 days at most) I only left it a 4 star review because it took almost 2 weeks to get here. But the product is GREAT. I will be buying it again! Summed up in 2 words.., BUY THIS!</li>
            <li> This product does a decent job of clearing my skin up and keeping me oil free.  I usually prefer a product to have more strength than this one, but I am able to apply this multiple times per day without excessive dryness.</li>
            <li> natural smell and very pleasant as well. It works quite effectively but slowly. Don&#x27;t make your skin dry. Price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I have used the Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Stress Control product for several years now and absolutely love it!  My dermatologist recommended that I use something with salicylic acid.  I used a couple other brands that either dried out and/or irritated my skin too much.  This product provides the exfoliation of the salicylic  acid while it moisturizes at the same time.  I can&#x27;t praise it enough!  Because it has become harder to find at local stores, I buy in bulk on Amazon.  Fortunately, though Amazon tends to have the lowest price.  It&#x27;s a win-win situation!</li>
            <li> I wanted salicylic acid product without alcohol because I have rosacea which flares up with alcohol use. Found this by surprise and I am in love with it. My face is so clear, better than in years, and I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 3 weeks. I feel like its other users: how could I do without it. I sincerely hope that Neutrogena is listening. Please make this product more available. Thanking you in advance!!!</li>
            <li> ORDERED THIS PRODUCT FOR MY DAUGHTER WHO HAS FREQUENT BREAK-OUTS. PROVED TO LIVE UP TO WHAT SHE NEEDED. THANKS NEUTROGENA!!!!</li>
            <li> I used the Neutrogena Rapid Clear product line for quite some time, and have always been pleased with it. However, I saw this similar product available at a much lower cost per ounce, so I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the Rapid Clear (and many other products) this uses salicylic acid at a 2% concentration as the active ingredient. It&#x27;s a very effective way to control acne provided you are not sensitive to the product - it can cause excessive redness and peeling for some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, unlike Rapid Clear, it also moisturizes. Best of all, it is totally invisible after it is applied. It also has a nice, mild scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the tube has a screw-on cap rather than a flip cap. Minor issue, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works well, and a good value since it comes in a 2 oz tube. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best acne moisturizer I have ever tried. I have only been using this product for a week, but the results have been stunning. My skin is SUPER sensitive to salicylic acid washes/creams. They tend to dry my skin out to the point of flaking after 3 uses. However, this product has broken the pattern and provided EXCELLENT acne prevention without over-drying. Within a week, 50 percent of my acne has disappeared. The larger, ingrown spots have gotten smaller. The tiny hard pimples have vanished. and my open spots have mostly healed without red irritation. I still have to use a dot of light moisturizer around my lips, but this is a great formula that will leave your skin hydrated AND protected :)</li>
            <li> Non-irritating, clears acne, reduces redness, and makes your face feel smooth !! Highly recommended ! I use it at night because I don&#x27;t particularly like the way it looks under make-up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with Acne for many years, now I&#x27;m in my mid 20s I figured it was time to really start looking into products to get rid of this stuff. I used this when I got out of the shower, after using the Neutrogena oil free acne wash, and had visible results the next morning. I can&#x27;t speak on the long term effects but if it helped this much over night I can only imagine after a week. Will update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Maybe it&#x27;s the way I&#x27;m using it. After a few days of use it feels like this is making my skin oily even though it says oil free. Stopped using it and went back to stridex pads. At least they seem to help.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin but this product doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me AT ALL. i think it made it worse! more acne started to appear after using if for 2 weeks. some people say it worked great for them, but not for me.</li>
            <li> Miracle! love love love this! So happy I decided to try this! It has worked miracles for me! Thanks Neoutrogena!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive combination skin with oily t zone and dry skin on cheeks and near the lips. The harsh winter season didn&#x27;t help my cause and resulted in both acne and dry skin at the same time! I used a doctor recommended moisturizer but that resulted in more breakouts. After reviewing different products online and reading the reviews of this product I decided to try this one and I must say it has been very effective. I have been using this product for over 2 weeks now and I must say I have noticed considerable difference in both skin and acne. It is refreshing, and soft on the dry skin and yet helps reduce breakouts and reduce the scars. I love the cool feeling and the smell it has and it remains effective for upto 7 hours! I would recommend this product for any one with sensitive skin who have acne.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff but it seems to be discontinued:(</li>
            <li> This stress control gel is a staple of my acne-free routine. I like it better than prescribed medications from my doctor. Used in combination with one prescription medicine, toner and a triple-C (OTC also) it all keeps my face clear, pours unclogged, face fresh and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the stress control gel because it doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin, doesn&#x27;t leave a film on the skin and isn&#x27;t messy or difficult to apply. Once in the morning and and at night. Does the job well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it if you have oily skin and need something to help control acne.</li>
            <li> I bought this produce mostly to minimize my pores on my nose, which it did not do. So I just thought maybe it&#x27;ll help keep my acne away. I used this consistently with the Stress Control face wash for about 2 weeks and for some reason I was getting more acne that I had before. I kept thinking.. maybe I just need to keep doing it, so I did. Another week went by and I was STILL getting acne.. and none of it was going away. I haven&#x27;t had problems with this bad of acne for a couple years now and since I started this.. its come back. So I decided to stop using this and I&#x27;m only on day 2 and my acne is disappearing! I don&#x27;t know if this is just too much for my skin or what but the only thing it did for me was create acne. I will not be recommending this product at all.</li>
            <li> I love this product and can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s been discontinued! I found this years ago when something I used by Avon was discontinued. This was even better and the thought of having to search again for something that works is so disappointing. I wish Neutrogena would bring it back.</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena products. This lotion moisterizes my skin for a few hours before I have to reapply. It&#x27;s very thin so I apply a couple layers in the morning. I like the thickness of the Rapid Clear Lotion and sometimes apply THAT product over this treatment.</li>
            <li> This stuff is just ok. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again for the price personally. It will dry your skin out and it comes in an extremely small tube so it wont last long at all for the price.</li>
            <li> Like many people who suffered from acne since childhood, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of anti-acne products out there.  This stuff is one of the best.  It does not leave your skin red and itchy because of overdrying, leaves it hydrated and also absorbs quickly.  I have seen marked improvements not only in acne but the product also seems to provide a sort of cooling effect which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t mind the smell.  It&#x27;s kind of mild in my opinion, sort of cucumber-ish scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is, why is this so hard to find?  Can&#x27;t find this in actual stores and I can only get it online?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please Neutrogena, don&#x27;t pull this from the market!</li>
            <li> It was only one container for approx. $30 and appeared to have been partially used.  I thought that I was getting 3 for that price or never would have ordered it.  I got instructions and a label from Amazon and sent it back.</li>
            <li> works like magic.  Wash your face well, make sure your facial surface is clean, and put these on and it will take care of the rest.&lt;br /&gt;I had acne problem on both side of my cheeks, and now I do not anymore.</li>
            <li> I hate all the girly and EXPENSIVE face washes on here. This stuff works for me... and it&#x27;s noticeable.  A little bit of dryness, but that was expected and it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li> my skin doesn&#x27;t absorb this, but it&#x27;s indeed not grassy... so three stars tops. as for acne control, it may have a little help, but not too much. Smells ok.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product that appears to no longer be available…anywhere???</li>
            <li> I have mild acne, however when I used this it didn&#x27;t really clear much away it just moisturized my face.. when I stop using it, that&#x27;s when more acne comes. I just wish it worked for me like everyone else says it worked for them... if you are having doubts about getting this, then don&#x27;t. Especially if you have severe acne. If it didn&#x27;t work for my mild acne then it sure wont work for severe acne.</li>
            <li> Even though I am past my teenage years I still struggle with breakouts. I have tried many treatments and combinations of products. I have been using this product with another face wash and the combination has been working for me. Granted, my face is not completely clear-- yet! My major breakouts have been mitigated thanks to this Product! I will definitely by more!</li>
            <li> hi.  I am looking forward to trying this product - as I have been looking for it at CVS, Walmart, Walgreens etc for months and it is not in stock anywhere.  I just want it for the &amp;#34;BHA&amp;#34; quality.  . . I don&#x27;t really have acne.  Does anyone just use it as part of their regular skin routine - does it help improve already fairly decent combination skin?  thanks!</li>
            <li> I read all the rave reviews and decided to try it on my hormonal, acne prone skin.  It does help with redness but it ended up making me oily as the day went on.  I don&#x27;t think it causes me to break out (which is a good thing!), but I was hoping for something more.  I&#x27;m going to finish the tube, but I won&#x27;t be buying again. The De La Cruz sulfur ointment that I ordered around the same time made a much more noticeable improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> I have looked for lots of acne control product, and I found it in its website because of the high rate. But after I used it, it made my skin broke-out although it is oil-free and clean. I will try to use another product next time.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who has acne. She has tried a lot of products and this one has worked better then any of the others. She uses it every night before she goes to bed. She gets bad breakouts when it&#x27;s that time of the month but once she started using this product her face didn&#x27;t break out at all. I&#x27;m going to order some for my son as well. If you have a problem with acne I recommend giving this a try. Also, the price is really good. So, what do you have to lose?</li>
            <li> My pre-teen daughter has been dealing with acne around her T-zone for a few months. She used Clinique&#x27;s emergency gel lotion intensive for a while, but the blemishes wouldn&#x27;t budge. I bought her this product based on the reviews, and it resolved the issue within days. Her skin is very sensitive and began to peel, so she stopped after a week. She&#x27;s dilligent about cleaning her face morning and night, and was acne-free for two weeks, but now they have begun to reappear. I think it&#x27;s about finding the right balance, so she&#x27;ll try applying it a few times a week and see how that goes.</li>
            <li> Takes care of both the stressed skin, and moisturizes it after washing my face. this stuff makes my life easy.</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin and can&#x27;t use regular moisturizers or else I break out like crazy.  I serendipitously realized that this was perfect for me.  It doesn&#x27;t really keep my face super clear like it says, but the few zits I do get go away pretty quickly and I&#x27;m not nearly as oily as I used to be.</li>
            <li> This has changed my skin dramatically.  I&#x27;ve had issues with acne and angry skin for years (I&#x27;m 39 now), and this is the first product that has made such a difference. I used it diligently after washing my face each morning, and I could see major results within two weeks. My skin was smoother, and my pores were cleaner.  I&#x27;ve tried so many things over the years, and have found my perfect treatment.  I hope it never gets discontinued!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for just 2 days and I&#x27;m already seeing a difference. I had a pimple growing and as soon as I started using this product it got smaller. I have to use it 3 times a day to keep my skin without oil but its worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to eliminate the blackheads on my nose, it did absolutely nothing and when I put it on any other part of my face I swear a pimple would appear. Extremely expensive too for this horrible skin care product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the smothness and softness I get from this product. Although I do still get a little dry if I use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> I saw that this product had alot of compliments, so it convinced me to try it. When I got it, I read the directions , and I applied it to my face. Until today it hasn&#x27;t helped me with anything and it feels like I&#x27;m just putting white clear cream on my face which is basically what I have been doing for a while. I personally hate this item, I feel like its a waste of money, but I guess it just wasnt for me 😒</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the Neutrogena Complete Acne System and they have both made my skin better in just 2 weeks! Even my scars are fading. These are my holy grail products, definitely repurchasing!</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is alcohol free but its a very light exfoliating gel....ok for combination skin but doesn&#x27;t help the blackheads on my oily nose where I really needed the salicylic acid to work.</li>
            <li> good for acne stress control</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering why this is not sold in stores anymore? I had to go here and purchase it. I have been breaking out a lot and not sure if this is actually helping yet.</li>
            <li> I have never thought to moisturize my skin since I had acne. After trying a couple of other products I was about to give up but then I tried this. This is the best product I have ever used on my skin after about a week I could already tell a difference in the appearance and texture of my skin. And it doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as the others. Don&#x27;t want to live my life without, only wish they made a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It has just the right amount of active ingredients and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out at all.  I&#x27;m really sad that Neutrogena decided to not make it again.  Or maybe they&#x27;re just repackaging it?  I can only hope.</li>
            <li> Seems alright.&lt;br /&gt;Not magic&lt;br /&gt;Helps more than it hurts but didn&#x27;t give me any huge difference as far as hydration or acne control.&lt;br /&gt;I have very light occasional acne/dry skin.</li>
            <li> very pleased really excellent product I can recommend it met my expectations so well that I was really very happy thank you</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any noticeable changes in my skin, as with all acne products it is kind of hit or miss</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive. There a lot of topicals  that I can&#x27;t use including things with SPF. There are some skin prescriptions that I can&#x27;t use because of sensitivity or allergies to the item.&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena Oil free stress control 3-n-1 is great for me. It helps prevent additional breakouts. I can also use it keep the occasional pimp from going ballistic and it helps to dry it up quickly. This is pretty amazing considering I have had to have my dermatologist even give me cortisone shots directly to some of the individual pimples of mine that have gone ballistic and become cysts.&lt;br /&gt;My only problem now is that it is not always in stock and sometimes you have to check around to find it now.</li>
            <li> My hubby has extremely oily skin and tends to have breakouts from time to time, and Neutrogena helps control the breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his case, Neutrogena helps the acne healing when the acne is growing at peak. He applied it on acne area every night. We didn&#x27;t experience major breakout problems with this product, neither it helped preventing acnes. But we weren&#x27;t expecting that either, so mission granted. I still think control stress and diet is the most important thing to deal with adult acnes. If that along with pharmacy cosmetic doesn&#x27;t work, then it&#x27;s not a simple problem as Neutrogena could solve. See a dermatologist and get prescriptions would help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We bought one bottle 2 years ago and it&#x27;s still lasting. Only drops on acnes needed with everytime usage, so it&#x27;s pretty long lasting. I&#x27;ve also bought him another bottle of Origin super spot remover and acne treatment gel which is around 15 dollars on origin website. He likes that as well, so he switches between them. Sometimes I stole his bottles and use on my skin as well. I have complex skin and only get acnes occasionally during cycles. These bottles weren&#x27;t very helpful for me. Anyway, I&#x27;ve seen significant improvement with his skin compared to 2 years ago. I think the credit should go to Neutrogena and Origins. Of course, as I said before, stress and diet control is equally important. He&#x27;s no longer under extreme stress as before, so that definitely helped as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know how acne problem could be bothering and best wishes to everyone who&#x27;s struggling.</li>
            <li> I used to have acne when I was in college but now I am 34 and again a couple of weeks ago my face suddenly got filled with acne (not sure what caused it), I did some googling and read many reviews.... after seeing this product on Amazon and reading reviews I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had tried many acne creams but did not found anything like this. I use it in morning after bath and in the evening after washing my face and it does work... very effective.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know this was a discontinued product and this was extra</li>
            <li> Well worth it the product is great for your face works good, and is a good price as well you can see the change as long as you go buy the instructions.</li>
            <li> I still think the charcoal soaps work better but this product does provide improvement to those not currently using any facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> Great if you have acne and is even mentioned by Paula from Paula&#x27;s choice. Has a great feeling to it and even has a great natural smell. I use this right before bed on alternating nights and skip the moisturizer because this provides a nice moist feeling.&lt;br /&gt;  Happy shopping! X</li>
            <li> This product worked rather well on my very prone acne skin. Used it am and pm. Doesn&#x27;t dry your face out either. Well worth the cheap price.</li>
            <li> I have used it for about 3 weeks now.  My breakouts are almost gone, and skin feels much better.  I use it twice a day.  I also use Neutrogena deep clean in the morning and Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash Daily Scrub at night.  I think I will keep using these products.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product based on the reviews, but after a few short days noticed I was breaking out more and it wasn&#x27;t reducing my current breakouts.  The formula is moisturizing and smells good, which I liked.  But I think I have come to the conclusion that salicylic acid doesn&#x27;t work on my skin.  Trying something with benzoyl peroxide instead.</li>
            <li> For me, I had more breakouts after using it for a few days. Not sure why.</li>
            <li> I gave this stuff a good try but it didn&#x27;t help as much as I&#x27;d hoped it would. I think my face IS a bit clearer, but still have a lot of acne on my chin and forehead. I really liked that it was moisturizing, though - my skin never felt dry or taut. On to the next thing to try...</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve ever used better than pro-active, and does not leave your face oily. I now have acne under control &amp; only 2-3 active pimples when I used to have like 15-20 all over my face.</li>
            <li> There are so many things I love about this product. First it definitely fights acne. I use it every day twice a day. My breakouts have calmed down. I&#x27;ve been having hormonal acne lately and I broke out so bad. I didn&#x27;t want to leave the house. This helped me get it under control. Second, it does not over-dry or irritate my skin AT ALL! When having to use an acne medication I was worried about flaking dry skin. Kind of like I remember when I was a teenager and slathered benzyl peroxide all over my face. I use this twice a day and I don&#x27;t hold back on the amount. It&#x27;s wonderful. And third, it is hydrating. There are days when I feel like I can skip my moisturizer and my face doesn&#x27;t get dry at all. I am kind of nervous that I never see this in the store. I wonder if Neutrogena has discontinued this particular product. They do have a different one out there that sound similar, but I think I will buy it here until I can&#x27;t find it anymore.</li>
            <li> I think its really fit to my skin, as she recommended. I think Id be skin beauty with this stuff.</li>
            <li> This was a life changer for me. I broke out a lot this past year and looked frantically for something to help restore my face back to normal. I saw this product and decided to give it a shot. I tend to use this either when I&#x27;m home all day during the weekend or right before bed. My skin wakes up clearer and smoother in the morning. Fortunately, it does not irritate my skin at all. I&#x27;ve been using this with another Neutrogena product called All-in-1 Acne Control Daily Scrub. I first wash off with the scrub and then apply this stress control after a little bit. It has worked wonders on me! My face has cleared up a lot! If you are having trouble with pesky acne, I&#x27;d say to give this a shot.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!! Helped tremendously!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both like this product.  Not too drying for mature skin and still effective for mild to moderate, non-cystic acne of a teen. Too bad they don&#x27;t sell it in stores in the US any longer.  Thank goodness for Amazon</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this item is how soft it makes your skin. It did not help with my acne.</li>
            <li> All through high school I struggled with acne and accepted it as teenage fate. When I went to college, however, I was fed up and decided to purchase Proactiv. For the first year, Proactiv worked great even if it had a not-so-great price tag. But when I started a new medicine and became very stressed, it wasn&#x27;t holding up. Again, I got fed up. I didn&#x27;t want to pay $100 for a product that was only half working. Thus, began the long and painful process of trying a series of new products. Nothing seemed to work and my face became so broken out I was about to pay anything just to get it to go away. I was intensely embarrassed and didn&#x27;t want anyone to see me...&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried Neutrogena&#x27;s Stress Control Acne Treatment. I was a little confused at first if it was a treatment or moisterizer, but it&#x27;s a little of both. And regardless: it works! I paired this with Cetaphil&#x27;s Gentle Skin Cleaner and my skin has NEVER looked this good. I almost never break out now and if I do, it&#x27;s brief and not too bad. Please, if you are even considering this product TRY IT! I cannot say enough about how wonderful it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001ET76EY Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser, For all skin types, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]]</li>
            <li> Perfect light weight summer moisturizer for sensitive skin that is prone to break outs.  I have tried a lot of different moisturizers and this one does the job with out make my face feel oily.</li>
            <li> Have looked for an acne product for years and I think I&#x27;ve found the one! Can be overly drying at times for your skin so don&#x27;t use too much but helps prevent/diminish breakouts! Great product and inexpensive</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and I really like it a lot.  And I will keep buying it.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would clear my acne. I have a lot of acne and using this helped cleared almost all. It works pretty fast and stops you from having future breakouts. The only con about this product is the small 2 oz size ): Make it at least 6 ox and I will be super happy! Trust me try it and you will love it but if you suddenly get more pimples when you first try it, don&#x27;t get worried because that is suppose to happen so don&#x27;t stop using it, it will clear up soon. Plus for the cheap price, there isn&#x27;t a risk! I&#x27;m a 16 year old male BTW haha.</li>
            <li> I used it for about a month straight, mainly around my nose area to help get rid of my blackheads. (I saw a beauty guru rave about it on youtube) It really works!!!! My blackheads got a lot smaller, as did the large pores around my nose. I stopped using it just because I didn&#x27;t have time and was traveling a lot, and now my nose got worse again, so I will definitely go back to using this regularly. I just put it on every night before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> This is not like proactive done expect to wake up and for it to be gone, you have to apply it at LEAST 2 times a day but overall it&#x27;s good. I guess...</li>
            <li> October - I have been using this daily since receiving it in the mail.  Due to a medication I am on my face keeps breaking out around my mouth and the acne I am getting is EXTREMELY painful, in addition to not looking well (up to 6 or 7 large painful cystic type around my mouth/cheek areas).  The acne seems to get worst at my mid cycle during the month and I am coming up on that soon, so I will have to report back on how its doing then.  But... since I have started it I have noticed older scars looking lighter and the overall complexion being less greasy.  Finally, it does not dry out my skin (I have combination) and the scent is light and pleasing.  The only gripe I have is I wish it came in a flip top cap.  I hate unscrewing it, putting the product on my fingers and then unsuccessfully trying to screw the top back on.  With 4 kids that one little modification would help me out as I wouldnt have to put down the bottle, put on the gel, wipe off my hands and then put the cap back on (all while hoping one of the toddlers doesnt grab the bottle!  But other than that simple &#x27;issue&#x27; I love this stuff so far.  I hope it keeps working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;November - Bump up to 5 stars!  Okay, one full cycle.  WOW!  My skin is so much better!  I had 1, yes only ONE! pimple throughout the entire month.  Of course, it was near my mouth, between my lip and cheek, as usual.  It was painful, but I kept up with the treatment and also added a spot medicine as well, I used Avons spot treatment - [[ASIN:B002S6NMF4 Avon Clearskin Professional Invisible Blemish Treatment]] and Clearasils [[ASIN:B001U0OQLS Clearasil Ultra 4 Hour Rapid Action Treatment Cream, Tinted Cream, 1-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 2)]] as well, alternating - I prefer Avons.  The pimple shrunk and most important, the pain is practically GONE, it usually takes about 3-5 days for the pain to completely disappear after one like that, but this time it went so much faster!  I am so happy to have found this, and so grateful.  I hope this review helps some out, I know how difficult, painful and depressing bad acne can be, hopefully this product will work for others as well as it has for me.lps some out, I know how difficult, painful and depressing bad acne can be, hopefully this product will work for others as well as it has for me.</li>
            <li> This product works! I would advise for you to get this if you have annoying red acne. I have hormonal acne when my period comes, so I wanted something that could prevent those from showing up on my face. Well, this counters my annoying red acne! Tried it for a month on my somewhat clear skin, and it does work! No acne shows up for a month. I also have a somewhat sensitive face for face products where normal sunblock can make my eyes tear up and burn my face. This will not burn your skin, which is great! The only con I have is that I&#x27;ve put this all over my face and it still can&#x27;t get some of my already-present blackheads on my face. This is just a minor issue with this treatment, but I was hoping it would get rid of that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, to the product itself. The acne treatment states that it can prevent acne from showing up, hydrates skin, and reduces redness. For me, this product does prevent acne and it really does hydrate your skin. It doesn&#x27;t dry up my skin like some other salicylic acid products. I can use this at night and not worry about having to put on a moisturizer on my face right after applying the treatment. However, I didn&#x27;t see any redness reduction when I used this. On a random note, the texture of this product is a bit watery and spreads easily over the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like this and I would buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of its amazing review. I have breakouts on my forehead mostly. This helped the pore to be smaller and I am happy about that. It doesn&#x27;t make the smaller one to fade though. For the price, I think it&#x27;s a good buy. Thank you reviewers.</li>
            <li> This was the BEST thing ever. It fought acne while moisturizing your face. The majority of the stuff out there either doesn&#x27;t work or dries your face out badly. This is the exact opposite; this worked very well and moisturized your face all in one application! I&#x27;m kicking myself for not stocking up on these. If I had known that they were going to discontinue it I&#x27;d have stockpiled like 20 of them or something because it was that great! I&#x27;m so sad to see that it&#x27;s not available anywhere. It was reasonably priced and is one of the few things that really worked well for me. I&#x27;m trying to get every last drop out of my tube right now :( This product needs to come back!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product cause i had some bad acne appeared the 2 week before school, i didn&#x27;t want to go looking like that so i ordered this as an emergency, and within 5 days of using i was almost clear, and haven&#x27;t gotten a single pimple emerge since then,  I&#x27;m disappointed this product isn&#x27;t available in any of the stores in my city or cities nearby but this product does actually work if you do your part of washing your face 2 times a day ( morning, night) with a different product i used Laikas whitening soap (sold on amazon and helps with acne) then apply this acne cream.&lt;br /&gt;I also take 100% organic Spirulina and chlorella green food tablets ( help rid the body of impurities and stimulates cell growth all around ) and dont forget to drink loads of water, i drink about 5-7 20oz bottles of water in a day&lt;br /&gt;although it hasn&#x27;t cleared up my face 100% pimples have stopped growing and my skin feels smoother and the redness has reduced about 70% i&#x27;m just left with scars and 20% redness. If you have scarring you will probably have to buy another cream for just that purpose, but if you got pimples only this product should clear it up</li>
            <li> My daughter has very sensitive skin and this works well for her.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne since i was 14 and now I&#x27;m 21. I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few days and noticed a clearer face. People have commented on it too. I noticed it helps with controlling how oily my face gets. Only draw back is that when i sweat and accidentally goes into my eyes, it burns like hell.  Lol</li>
            <li> Been using this product for three days and can already see a difference in red spots and bumps on my face. I&#x27;m loving it so far.</li>
            <li> didn;t help acne or blackheads or whiteheads at all, even feel dry and winkles after applying it,anyway,dones;t like it ,maybe PHA is too harsh to me,acne prone skin better use some gentle stuffs</li>
            <li> I have had problems with acne ever since high school, and I am one of those people who have tried every little thing to make it go away. Now that I am older I only get breakouts once a month,  but its not the acne that really bothers me its the redness that stays afterwards that takes forever to go away.  I have finally found a routine that works for me. I wash my face with a medicated anti-bacterial complexion bar, then put this on afterwards (before this I was moisturizing with aloe vera, which actually works really well) I stayed away from products that had strong chemicals in thm for awhile as they would just leave my skin dried out then my skin would over compensate forthat and get really oily. I do have overactive sebaceous glands, but this product doesnt do that. It has a pleasant smell, doesnt dryout your skin, and instead leavesyour skin feeling cool and clean and soft. I have been using it twice a day, once at night, and in the morning for a few weeks now and I definitely see improvement, my acne is slowly going away and the redness is going away as well. So far I am very pleased. This is definitely a good product to try if you struggle with acne, just be patient.</li>
            <li> I realize everyone&#x27;s skin reacts differently, but this product has worked wonders for me after only using it twice.  It does leave my skin a little dry, but I expected that.  Now I can&#x27;t even see my pores in my lighted 10x magnification mirror, and it has greatly reduced the slight redness I had around my nose and on my chin.  I will definitely keep using this in the future.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and it&#x27;s done a great job in keeping my face relatively acne-free.  When I stopped being able to find it locally, I tried a couple other salycylic acid products and none of them had the same performance.&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, Amazon came through and I have found my new source!&lt;br /&gt;This is great if you wax, too.  A thin application daily helps prevent ingrown hairs and it&#x27;s non-irritating.</li>
            <li> I mainly use it as a daytime moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of facial moisturizers and have been really unhappy with them because it always leave my face greasy or it feels heavy.  But the Neutrogena Oil Free Ance Stress Control is great, because it moisturizes my face without it looking greasy throughout the day; and at night I use a &amp;#34;heavier&amp;#34; moisturizer.  I can&#x27;t determine whether this works for me as an acne control since I use other products in conjunction to this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this after I received a facial and the facialist explained that my pores needed exfoliation but that scrubs probably weren&#x27;t the best idea for my reactive skin.  This gel goes on light and smells good - not too strong just a light fresh scent.  I don&#x27;t use it all the time because I have since switched to more natural products, but my skin did respond well to it and I have lots of redness and flaky large pores.  It would be a good every day acne preventative and I think it&#x27;s ideal for people in their teens to late thirties.  If you want something to target a random pimple, this gel is not the strongest and you may want to get a targeted cream or gel.  This is good for fading spots that a pimple leaves though and I have used it on new pimples with good results - it doesn&#x27;t over dry or irritate my skin around the pimple.</li>
            <li> So happy I found this product after it seemed to be discontinued in all the my local stores. I bought several hoping it would last me at least a year. Neutrogena needs to bring this product back!!!!</li>
            <li> I have no idea what happened with Neutrogena that this product suddenly disappeared from everywhere -- if it was discontinued then resurrected or what -- but it doesn&#x27;t matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that really matters is that this amazing acne treatment has returned to being available. It really is the best thing out there and trumps pretty much all of Neutrogena&#x27;s other products (and perhaps all other mainstream acne treatment products, period). I can only hope this isn&#x27;t just a tease and that this is back for good.</li>
            <li> great product.. neutrogena discontinued it .. rumours were that the rest of the line wasn&#x27;t selling well because this has 3 different uses..in 1.. where as other products on their line only has one.. or two..</li>
            <li> I bought this for spot treatment and it works really well.  I love the smell, too.  It makes your skin soft as well.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it.  Cleans and does not dry out her face.</li>
            <li> I have had acne since elementary school, and I&#x27;m now 29.  I have been on Accutane and used Proactiv, and neither worked that well.  A few years ago, I found this neurtogena acne product and I have used it ever since. My skin is very sensitive and gets dry, but this medicine keeps your skin hydrated which helps keep the acne away.  Its a miracle for my acne!  You can even put it on if you decide not to wash your face and it will work!  I am sooo disappointed that Neurtogena is discontinuing it from this line.  Please e-mail Neurtogena if you want to save this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product and am so disappointed it has been taken off the market. I am having a hard time finding it...come back!</li>
            <li> This is a gel-based lotion, whose main active ingredient is 2% salicylic acid. I mostly \\&quot;outgrew\\&quot; my acne after my teen years but every so often I have a few really bad cysts. I usually use benzoyl peroxide lotions for those breakouts but those can be rough on my sensitive skin (redness, dryness), so I&#x27;m always looking for a better option. I decided to give this a try since it had a lot of positive reviews. It is a light lotion that smells vaguely of cucumber. It&#x27;s not a strong smell but it is very lingering so some people might not like that. It did seem to make any other lotion I put on top of it (moisturizer, sunscreen) seem \\&quot;tacky\\&quot; or \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; though. It did reduce skin redness and it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but for some reason it made my acne worse a lot worse. I was getting numerous small bumps underneath the skin where I normally wouldn&#x27;t get acne (forehead, near my hairline, in my eyebrows). They didn&#x27;t seem like traditional whiteheads either but there were a lot of them all at once and I could feel them under my skin when I ran my hand across my face. It also didn&#x27;t seem to be effectively treating the acne I already had before I started using it. I know there can be a \\&quot;purging\\&quot; period when you switch products, but I usually get traditional whiteheads when that happens and not these weird numerous bumps under my skin. I know I&#x27;m not allergic to salicylic acid because I&#x27;ve used that a lot before in other products, but this does list silicones and dyes in the ingredient list. My skin is probably reacting to that because I haven&#x27;t changed anything else in my routine. Also, the product I purchased in August had an expiration date of December of the same year. I don&#x27;t use very much product so I would prefer a longer expiration date so I don&#x27;t waste any of it. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> Ever since using this product my skin is glowing and has ZERO acne. My face is now more appealing and my acne has practically vanished. I use this every night after I wash my face, and it is working great. I don&#x27;t think I could ever go back to any old product I was using... The only down side is that if you use it morning and night you skin will peel, so pick one or the other. Over all the most AMAZING acne vanishing product (better than proactive or clean and clear). You will love your beautiful looking skin with this product!!!!!  :-)</li>
            <li> As an adult, it amazes me that I&#x27;m still prone to breakouts. I began using this product several years ago, around the time when it was first put on the shelves, and have been using it for many years. If you wear foundation/makeup daily as I do, it is very important to have a barrier between your skin and the foundation, as there&#x27;s all kinds of \\&quot;goodies\\&quot; in the foundation that can add to skin irritation and breakouts. The problem for most adults is we need to have a barrier that doesn&#x27;t dry out our skin, but doesn&#x27;t add too much moisturizer which contributes to blemishes. This addresses both of those points wonderfully. I haven&#x27;t found anything better, and frankly have no desire to switch to anything else at this point because I am quite satisfied. In addition to using this daily beneath my foundation/makeup, I use [[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System, 0.68-Fluid Ounce]] (the spin brush, not the cleanser it comes with) along with [[ASIN:B000E2622E Tea Tree Skin Care Soap 3-Pack 4 oz bars - 3 - Bar]] for cleansing, [[ASIN:B000GCQ04C Dickinson&#x27;s Original Witch Hazel Pore Perfecting Toner 16 oz.]] for toning, and [[ASIN:B0009NBCXC NOW Foods Jojoba Oil Pure, 4 ounce]] for keeping my skin soft without breaking it out (please see my review on that amazing stuff)! These things along with the Neutrogena Oil Free Acnee Stress Control 3-in-1 Hydrating Acne Treatment have helped me quite alot in keeping my skin much clearer more consistently than without these items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, a really effective (and cheap) way to keep your pores and skin clear is something you may already have in your kitchen cupboards...plain, old fashioned oatmeal! That&#x27;s right, an oatmeal mask. Now, while this is messy, and something you will want to do over your kitchen sink, it is what I keep going back to even after trying fancy-shmancy store-bought concoctions. All you have to do is take about 1/3-1/2 cup of dry oatmeal, add very warm water to it to make a pretty thick consistency (thicker than if you were preparing it to eat) then let it cool enough to safely rub on your face, (you will have gross chunks of oatmeal hanging, but trust me, this is worth it) and let dry for about 5 minutes. After the 5 minutes are up, get an old washcloth, wipe off the chunks, rinse your face thoroughly in warm water, then wash as usual, and follow up with toning your skin with witch hazel (dirt cheap if you buy generic, usually in the rubbing alcohol aisle). Do this about 2 or so times a week, (although I recommend witch hazel daily for toning) and you will notice a difference I&#x27;m sure. FYI, initially, when you do any oil-absorbing mask, be forewarned: you may get an intitial breakout a few days later, but don&#x27;t worry as this is normal. The oatmeal is drawing out the impurities to the surface. If you do this on a regular basis, then these after-mask-breakouts should decrease and stop, as long as you are consistent. I used to be a makeup artist/skin care consultant as well as sell skin care products and cosmetics at a department store, and while the products were good, there were no great options in my line at that time (quite a while back) for adults with blemish-prone skin, such as myself, who were also wanting \\&quot;just the right amount\\&quot; of hydration, which can be found in this Neutrogena product. I have found over the years that some of the best options for clear, healthy skin can be found for cheap in your own kitchen, at your local drugstore, and of course, on Amazon.nsistency (thicker than if you were preparing it to eat) then let it cool enough to safely rub on your face, (you will have gross chunks of oatmeal hanging, but trust me, this is worth it) and let dry for about 5 minutes.

            <li> Eh, it&#x27;s okay, but certainly no miracle. Granted, I have terrible skin anyway, so, I take that into consideration when trying any product. But, this does nothing for me other than dries me out terribly, and causes my skin to look flaky. Yes, I&#x27;m aware my skin problems are not solely the fault of this product...but, that&#x27;s why I gave it 3 stars instead of none.</li>
            <li> After one use, my skin felt tight and it was so dry. Disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not hating on the product, just doesn&#x27;t work with me.</li>
            <li> My daughter being using this product for a week and her face looks clear she looks Moore confident now. I recommend</li>
            <li> Absoultely love...just ordered more. Hope they never discontinue this product in canada or my skin is going to be upset.</li>
            <li> Again I love this product....it hydrates like nothing else I have ever used...would recommend it very highly to anyone for sure</li>
            <li> This is so great. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week and my skin just looks amazing. I normally get white heads, black heads and stupid little pimples around my nostrils. the black heads are gone, the white heads seem like theyre rising to the surface, soon to be removed and my little pimples around the nostrils are gone!!!! woohooo!! my skin appears even toned with this... its a must try!!</li>
            <li> I loved this stuff so much!!  It helped to calm my skin and keep it clear but it looks like it&#x27;s discontinued now which is a real bummer!!  Hope they bring it back!</li>
            <li> Love this acne treatment, just wish I could buy it in the stores!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe they took it off the production. Great product.</li>
            <li> I was tired of having to apply several different products. I love that this enables me to use only one. It feels very lightweight, sinks in, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li> this is such a great product. btw I have normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I read others reviews about this product. I ordered it right away.  It goes on smooth. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I use it almost every day.</li>
            <li> One of the best lower-priced acne remedies I&#x27;ve found. It won&#x27;t work miracles but the &amp;#34;Acne Stress Control&amp;#34; line has brought my acne down to a more manageable level without irritating my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion totally helps keep my acne prone skin in check.  I use it on a daily basis and the skin drying effects are minimal.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and mild acne.  I needed something that would treat my acne but still give some hydration.  I live in a humid climate, so I can&#x27;t have too much hydration.  This has a liquid gel-like consistency and sinks in quickly.  In the two weeks that I&#x27;ve used it, it has cleared up my acne and clogged pores without making my skin dry and flaky like other stronger acne medications I&#x27;ve used in the past.  It really has made quite a difference in the appearance of my skin.  I will be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li> Worked in a matter of 4 days. Smells amazing. And prevent breakouts!! Nothing else I can say works like a charm!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this thing because I thought that it was going to work, it did work for about 3 days but then it just broke me up so bad and I started getting very big pimples :I I have pimples sometimes so I thought that this might help but it just made it worse, I would not recommend this item to anyone</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an inexpensive product to help control dry and oily skin look no further. Before buying this product I was using proactiv for $45 each month and this item is just as good for a lot less.</li>
            <li> It works best on my oily skin, I love it, don&#x27;t know what I am going to do when it runs out!!</li>
            <li> Fyi, Neutrogena Rapid Clear Acne Defense Face Lotion 1.7 Fluid Ounce (50 ml) at about $7 is pretty close to this.  Same 2% salicylic acid with effective ph &amp;#60;4 and no or minimal alcohol.</li>
            <li> this product doesn&#x27;t seem to be available locally at this point, so I tried Amazon and was thrilled to be able to get it sent out automatically every couple of months.  a great product for someone a little older (like me) who still has issues with blemishes, but needs some moisturizer.  thanks for offering such a great service!</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t understand what the rave is...this product certainly did not work for me and even left a green gooey residue. Guess it works for some but not all people.</li>
            <li> Great Product. It is really reduce stress for acne. Usually I when I have acne it showed up with big red area around acne that made my face look terrible. After I used this product my acne became very small red spot  and it gone quick ,small acne only stay on my face for one night and then gone in the next day morning. Most of the time it is hard to find good price on Amazon. Then later I found good price on Neutrogena website.</li>
            <li> Well with the try for troubled skin, please with results.  May not be suitable for everyone but good product.  Please with product</li>
            <li> This is the first product I found that could actually reduce redness on my acne. It treats current acne, but doesn&#x27;t do much for preventing acne. I still had pimples popping up every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very light liquid. It absorbs into the skin quickly. You won&#x27;t feel it anymore after 5 minutes of applying. It made my skin feel rejuvenated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is so small. I went through it in less than a month, using it day and night. So it&#x27;s quite expensive for that small amount.</li>
            <li> So glad amazon brought this back, this really is a good moisturizer. VERY light, smooth, and does not have a strong odor.</li>
            <li> This is the best hydrating acne treatment I have used so far. I have had visibly better skin, and it does not dry my skin out so I&#x27;m incredibly happy with the product.</li>
            <li> This is not for acne, actually I didn&#x27;t see any good result, on the contrary it made it worse! After using this more acne started to appear!</li>
            <li> This treatment works very well. Not oily on the skin. Regular user and repeat buyer. So it&#x27;s good for us.</li>
            <li> Great at clearing up the face. It has a liquid to gel consistency. It&#x27;s lightweight that I wear it under my makeup and it doesn&#x27;t dry up my face. Wish they didn&#x27;t discontinued this product.</li>
            <li> I chose this product based on the reviews however, after using it for four days (morning and evening) my face dried out and was red and blotchy. I&#x27;ve been off of it for a week now and my face is still recovering. I will say that this product is no longer available in stores and the expiration date is this December so I am not sure how old this particular batch is. I do have sensitive skin and I am not sure if that has a play in it but I would not recommend this product for anyone with sensitive skin :(</li>
            <li> I feel like i have tried it everything until I got to this. This stuff works, enough said. Try it, and thank me later. Been using it for 5 months now, worked better for me than Proactive, so had to write something.</li>
            <li> My very oily skin (which I am sure I&#x27;ll appreciate when I get older) has an uphill battle to stay blemish free and can become monster-bad if I am not very strict with water intake and many many other variables.  I&#x27;d been using the $38 per 1 ounce \\&quot;ClearPrep FX Matte Foundation Primer and Anti-Acne Treatment\\&quot; from Sephora, which I LOVE, yet... Thanks to many acne forums, I found that if you mix 50% \\&quot;Monistat Soothing Care Chafing Relief Powder-Gel\\&quot; with 50% \\&quot;Neutrogena Acne Stress Control, 3-in-1 Hydrating Acne Treatment\\&quot; then it will work as effectively as the ClearPrep primer (if not better), in that it prevents blemishes and shrink pores over time as well as the ClearPrep $38/oz for under $10/oz.  I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks and have been very happy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this product for a few years now.  I initially had very little faith in it working since it is a salicylic acid treatment...but I tried it after hearing rave reviews.  It is amazing and leaves my skin feeling smooth and moisturized.  My skincare routine that has cleared my acne contains: Acne org face wash and BP treatment, tea tree oil, jojoba oil, Thayers witch hazel and Neutrogena hydrating treatment.  I was so sad when I couldn&#x27;t find this stuff in the stores anymore and my face had a few breakouts while I was out of it.  I did thankfully find it online at walmarts website for $6.50ish this summer and bought a tube and now 5 months later I&#x27;m almost out but when I went to walmarts website to buy more I found out it is apparently out of stock online.  So I start freaking out and looking all over the internets for this stuff and I found it here for about double the retail price (sad face).  I kept looking and it turns out that it can be bought (at least currently) on the Neurtogena website AND they had a (thanksgiving?) deal, buy 1 product get 1 50% off so I bought 6 tube, paying $7 for 3 of them and $3.50 for the other 3.  Much better than on here which is why I decided to write a review letting anyone who may be desperately searching like I was that you don&#x27;t have to pay a ridiculously inflated price (at least for now while Neutrogena is still selling it directly).  I hope this product appears back in stores sometime soon, so many people love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: It&#x27;s out of stock on Neutrogenas website now too  (12/6/13)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and I started breaking out on my skin and neck like crazy. I tried numerous products and using this one has almost cleared it up in a matter of 1 week! I clean my face every night and put a thin layer of this stuff on and it doesn&#x27;t sting or make my skin all dry and tight like some other products do. I can highly recommend trying this and it&#x27;s not crazy expensive either/</li>
            <li> Very hard to find in stores! its like makeup for guys!!! Makes acne fade away, redness goes away and keeps skin full with moisture.</li>
            <li> I use this maybe every other day.  As long as my stress level is medium it works fine.  I just get broken out around my mouth and only on occasion.  Awhile back I was extremely stressed out and had quite a few breakouts around my mouth and it didn&#x27;t seem to help at all.  Ended up buying something else but never know if it&#x27;s diet or stress or because of the product I am using.  So I use it but not on major emergencies.</li>
            <li> cant really help me.. get lever 200 soap or dial soap to wach your acne face better... not recommend this product!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a gentle, daily BHA, this is one of the best formulations around.  Goes on light with no irritating ingredients...just does what it is supposed to do.  It would be excellent if supplemented with an occasional BHA peel! :)</li>
            <li> I have been trying to manage my acne for at least a decade.  After trying everything on the market (that didn&#x27;t require a costly trip to the dermatologist), I ordered this product.  It is simply amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the span of the two most stressful weeks at work and planning my wedding during my \\&quot;time off,\\&quot; my skin has actually cleared up.  I repeat, with work and wedding stress, my skin is getting CLEARER.  I have tried so many products and none have worked as well and gently as this product.  Big sloppy kisses to Neutrogena for making this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Neutrogena ever decides to stop, I&#x27;m going to stockpile as I intend to use this until my acne goes away... maybe in 2075.</li>
            <li> It feels good on your skin, helps to balance any redness, and it&#x27;s a perfect makeup primer. A little goes a long way so lasts a long time. It&#x27;s not too strong (can&#x27;t handle Benzoyl Peroxide all over the face so much) but not too weak. I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore and can&#x27;t find anything to replace/compare it with so I know i can&#x27;t be without it now!</li>
            <li> Love this product! It&#x27;s too bad that Neutrogena discontinued this product 2 years ago :(</li>
            <li> This is the only product that has been clearing my ongoing teenage acne. I am incredibly disappointed that it has been out of stock! Hands down the best acne product I have ever used. If anyone has found any sites that still have it in stock please share!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon emailed me saying it was back in stock. I ordered a bunch so I will not be running out anytime soon!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have enough words to rave about this product! I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who has acne products and is looking for an amazing treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Background: I have combination skin normally, but it&#x27;s been exceptionally dry this winter. I also don&#x27;t really get acne unless my period is coming or I&#x27;m under extreme amounts of stress. However, I still like to get acne products so I don&#x27;t have to re-experience the horrors that were my teen years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was kind of hesitant about this product when I saw that it was Neutrogena. I never really felt like any of their products made a difference, you kind of just used it for the sake of putting something on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I got it, I can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to purchase it. It&#x27;s literally the most moisturizing product EVER. I don&#x27;t know why some people said it&#x27;s sticky when it&#x27;s really not, it&#x27;s like putting water on my face (in the best way possible). Strangely, I also really like the smell -- I know some people probably aren&#x27;t a fan of it, but it smells kind of minty to me. I&#x27;m pretty sure the smell just tricks me into thinking the treatment is working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my skin has never been bad, I can&#x27;t say that it has drastically improved or anything of the sort. But I can say my skin just FEELS better. It feels hydrated and really smooth. It also looks a lot brighter now and cleaner especially. I use it as just a moisturizer or if I&#x27;m feeling really dry, I use a normal moisturizer under it before putting on foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great product and definitely worth the $12 dollars. Do not hesitate, try it out!</li>
            <li> I thought this product had been discontinued, but I&#x27;m thrilled to see that it&#x27;s back in stock! This is the only acne treatment that I use because it&#x27;s gentle and effective. Apply this after you cleanse your face and before your moisturizer. The salicylic acid gently exfoliates and reduces both existing and previous blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;I work for a high-end cosmetics line (can&#x27;t mention the name - but it starts with a Ch) ;) and I can tell you that this works better than anything they sell, and for a fraction of the price. I&#x27;ve struggled with acne for years and now I have flawless, glowing skin thanks to Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> For anyone ages 12-25, this product is the best thing for night time acne treatment. I used it for years and everyone thinks I have great skin. I am not blemish free but my face looks pretty darn good thanks to this stuff. It will not give you movie star results but it will keep your skin soft and clear. Be sure to use every night AFTER washing - daytime use is possible but it does not mix well with sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Update July 2016: Neutrogena no longer sells this in this large tube. AVON has the best buy for a 2% salycilic acid cream: [[ASIN:B00A9YUXMC Avon Clearskin Blemish Clearing 2-in-1 Treatment &amp; Hydrator]]. And something, like Clerasil with 10% benzoil peroxide will kill the bacteria. Salycilic acid will exfoliate and achieve slightly different results, but it will also dry them up. Something that also works well, OVERNIGHT, to dry them up on my son&#x27;s teenage and sensitive skin is [[ASIN:B0017SWIU4 Mario Badescu Drying Lotion, 1 fl. oz.]] Find the Avon version at youravondotcomslashpinkpoodle  ---- This is the same 2% salycilic acid as in the Murad gel. Murad costs about 5 times more, however. This product works best when you use it every single night. At first your skin may break out more as it &amp;#34;boils&amp;#34; all the acne to the surface. But after 2 weeks you will notice less acne and acne will disappear completely if you keep using this every night. The other Murad item that is a great spot treatment is the Sulphur cream. Amazon has a good low cost version of this as well: [[ASIN:B00411B4CC De La Cruz Sulfur Ointment Cream]]  The sulphur cream can be applied on top of a pimple, preferably a few times per day and within 12 hours you will see a rapid reduction of the pimple&#x27;s size and tenderness. Sulfur kills the bacteria. The third item in Murad is the salicylic wash which is equivalent to the Neutrogena gel wash [[ASIN:B001EUQBRQ Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash Facial Cleanser, Pink Grapefruit, 6 Ounce]]. The final item should be an oil-free SPF30 moisturizer applied every morning [[ASIN:B003XUROHQ Neutrogena Oil Free Moisture SPF 35, 2.5  Ounce]]. You may need to use this gel in the morning and at night if it doesn&#x27;t seem to be getting rid of all the acne after 2 weeks.  I promise you if you use these you will cure your acne. I wish I had had this in high school. But now I am setting up my own kids with this system. It will also help to fade your acne scars.  This 2%salicylic acid gel exists elsewhere ([[ASIN:B001E96ORO Neutrogena Rapid Clear Acne Defense Face Lotion, 1.7 Ounce (Pack of 3)]]) but in much less volume for the same price. So this is a really good deal...I expect Neutrogena 3-in-1 hydrating acne treatment  will be discontinued because it is a better value than the Rapid Clear Acne Defense Face Lotion. Update: This is disappearing from stores, but Neutroogena still sells it for a reasonable price on their site.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Helps relieve redness and break-outs on my middle-aged, very sensitive skin without drying.  Very happy to find this product at Amazon as it can be difficult to find in local stores.</li>
            <li> Didnt really do much for me. Not impressed. Nice packaging and consistency of the actual product was light and cooling. But no effect on acne.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this product in January because of all the amazing reviews I had read about it. Upon receiving my package, my expectations were slightly deflated as I noticed the treatment was seemed very . . . watery as I shook the bottle.  I have extremely dry skin when I first wash my face so I usually need a pretty heavy moisturizer for the dryness to go away, but then after a few hours my face gets super oily which sucks. So with an already lowered expectation, I immediately washed my face and then put the treatment on. I was disappointed. My face was still dry even though the bottles claims to moisturize as well as get rid of blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I decided to stick through this treatment since I already paid for it, and I&#x27;m happy to say that I made that decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few days, it&#x27;s almost like my skin got used to how light and weight-free this treatment is. Even though sometimes I still need an extra boost of a heavier moisturizer, I only apply it around my dry spots like around my nose which is amazing since I used to put heavy moisturizers all over my face before I bought this product. My pimples started going away (my face looks so much better!) AND it controls my oily skin which is another huge bonus! So for people who have dry skin at first like me then turn into a greasy monster, give this product a definite go!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of stuff to try to get rid of my acne, but I think this has helped the most.&lt;br /&gt;The last couple months, I had acne around my mouth / nose area a lot and it was driving me nuts! Every time it would go away, the next day, some new pimples would come! AGH. But then ever since I tried this, I noticed that the existing pimples got less red and got a bit smaller. Now they are still kind of there, but a lot less prominent and no new pimples have arrived yet in the area that I have applied this. It doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my skin at all, and I use it once a day after I take a shower before I go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this :) .</li>
            <li> i can not live without it ( actually i can but i wont be happy&lt;br /&gt;it is so good i love it</li>
            <li> Let me start by stating I don&#x27;t have what I would consider to be &amp;#34;super bad&amp;#34; acne. I am 26 and still do get breakouts despite taking excellent care of my skin. I tried proactive in the past for those trouble some pimples but I wasn&#x27;t happy with how long it took for the product to work and it never seemed to prevent the breakout. Keep in mind my &amp;#34;breakouts&amp;#34; are only maybe one or two but very big and painful bumps. I have combination skin so finding the right product that doesn&#x27;t cause to much dryness or to much oiliness is very difficult. I wanted to wait to write this review until I felt a pimple forming to see if this could prevent it. (I started out using this product with about 3 or 4 small pimples that were gone in two days of use, three times per day.) I am happy to report that this product works, and works well. I felt the pimple coming, I used the product as a spot treatment a few times a day, and sure enough it never reared it ugly head.&lt;br /&gt;This product is all about balance and that&#x27;s why it works for my combination skin so well. You will need to play with it to figure out how many times per day you should use it, for me it depends on what other products I am using on my face that day (sunscreen, makeup, moisturizers). But I would definitely recommend giving this product a try. I did purchase this from Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, but you don&#x27;t want to turn your face shiny and oily, right? So use it just twice a week. It really hydrates your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with break outs since I started college. I always had beautiful skin before that. Going from beautiful skin to acne is hearbreaking but through the years you become an expert because you&#x27;ve tried almost everything thing from presciptions, over the counter, and even products from Mexico. I read a lot of good reviews and I was watching a youtube video on how to cure acne and they recommended this product. So I got this product and I&#x27;m impressed. I use it under my make-up and my break outs have pretty much gone completely away. I do have a regimen but this product gives me piece of mind during the day and I couldn&#x27;t live without it! If you&#x27;re looking for a product that feels good on your skin, is gentle, smells nice and helps clear up break outs you must try it. It won&#x27;t work on everyone because were all different but I think it works on most. So if you&#x27;re on the edge I would say definitely take the leap and spend $7 to see if it will work for you odds are it will. Good luck!</li>
            <li> best face lotion for oily skin point blank period. very light yet just the right touch of moisture. leaves my face so soft. highly upset that this has been discontinued. it seems a lot of people like this product. can only find sparingly at discount retail stores and onle. used to be four dollars a tube now i pay close to ten :(</li>
            <li> Seems to work pretty well for most acne spots.  Decent product, but not perfect.  I would recommend that you give it a try!</li>
            <li> This is great for oily summer skin!</li>
            <li> I saw this listed as one of beautypedia&#x27;s &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; BHA exfoliators. It says on the site this is only sold in Canada so I was thrilled to see I could get it on amazon prime! I&#x27;ve added this to my nightly skin care routine. I put this on after I&#x27;ve washed and toned my face. It does have a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; feel but not uncomfortable.  I then put my serum and moisturizer on after.  Although I don&#x27;t really have bad ache, have more oily skin with some some redness so I put this product on those areas. I also have sensitive skin and my skin took this product well. I&#x27;d recommend this for a more affordable BHA exfoliant!!</li>
            <li> I can suddenly only find this here on amazon - it works great, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, and is pretty efficient overall, just now very hard to come by.  I&#x27;ve recommended it to a few friends &amp; they love it but also find it hard to track down.</li>
            <li> I bought this to be used as a mild chemical exfoliant for my aging, yet still combination/acne prone skin. Paul Begoun recommended it on Beautypedia and it works as well for much more expensive creams at a fraction of the cost. It would be great if it less harmful chemicals, hence only a 4 instead of 5 star review. I also use Neutrogena Naturals products so if they can change the formula, I wish they would.</li>
            <li> it is a great product!&lt;br /&gt;you don&#x27;t ned to apply a lot of product, it hydrates your face really nice!</li>
            <li> didnt notice a differance.. It didnt break my face out so thats good. Just didnt see any improvement for my face.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and seems to work very well. All of the Neutrogena 3-in1 products are quality made and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter-in-law at Christmas after hearing her complain about her acne and reading what looked to be good reviews on this product. I did ask a few months later if it was working, and if so, did she need me to order more. The answer was a definite YES so I guess for her it is doing a good enough job or better than anything else she has tried.</li>
            <li> I do not know what to say about this product because I did not do anything for my skin. I have not seen the results they acclaimed.&lt;br /&gt;neither did well or did bad.&lt;br /&gt;is only a matter of try out and see.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 17 years old(male), last year when I was 16 I went to my doctor and the doc told my mom to get benzoyl  peroxide for acne treatment, I&#x27;ve been using it for months, it didn&#x27;t remove my acne at all. When I bought neutrogena, after few days I already see my acne dessapear&#x3D;D If you have acne, get this.</li>
            <li> Smelt pretty bad, didn&#x27;t do much and just didn&#x27;t seem to suit my skin type. Wish I could say something good about it but it didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be amazing but no. I bought japanese acne treatment and it works so much better. I broke out from this! The reason I decided to switch to using japanese skin products is because their skin care products are much more advanced than ours here in the staes. Their people are known to be obsessed with skin care and are famous for their beautiful skin, so there is high demand over there for skin care products that actually works. I&#x27;m not even japanese guys, this is my personal advice to the world because I spent years trying to get rid of my acne. really, don&#x27;t use this crap.</li>
            <li> Worked pretty well back in the day. Now I use other stuff like tretinoin...with tons of sun protection of course!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.  It is hydrating and weightless and has worked great for me with the use of the rest of the line.  I hate feeling like my face is greasy after lotion and this kind of just feels like a gel.  Unfortunately, I couldn&#x27;t find this anywhere and emailed Neutrogena to see what was going on.  They advised that this product was discontinued and they recommended the Rapid Clear line.  I have yet to try that.</li>
            <li> I have had plmples on my nose. I have been using this for a month and it made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> This is just like every other acne treatment you have tried.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing particularly special or good about it. Didn&#x27;t really do much to my skin. My acne isn&#x27;t terrible, but it does flare up occasionally. This treatment didn&#x27;t do anything to those flare-ups. Don&#x27;t waste your money on it.</li>
            <li> Look, my whole family has always suffered from acne, it sucks. We have oddly greasy skin and rosacea runs in our family. When I was in 11th grade, suffering some of the worst skin in my life. My older sister, bought this on a whim, and allowed me to use it. My skin had gone back to a 10 years old&#x27;s, before I had any problems with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, after not being able to find it in stores for around 3 years, I have painful cystic acne, and wake up to whiteheads no matter what. I&#x27;ve recently ordered it on Amazon, and my skin is slowly making it&#x27;s way to it&#x27;s former glory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff it takes time to work it&#x27;s way. So give it at least until you run out of your bottle. Also it&#x27;s more of a post-cleansing and moisturizing (if you have oily skin, because pretty much, you want your skin to think it doesn&#x27;t need to produce oil, so you won&#x27;t have your problems, so you need to over-moisturize) step. It&#x27;s a treatment, that you leave on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t worry about how thin and liquidy the green stuff is, it&#x27;ll get in your pores and make your skin so oddly baby-smooth, it&#x27;ll be hard for you not to touch your face and for anyone who does also, to not touch it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s incredibly gentle on your skin and I carry it around and use it throughout the day. But I have super oily skin, so it might not work for those you with nice sensitve skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But pretty much, it&#x27;s awesome, like magic and probably discontinued because Neutrogena doesn&#x27;t bet on the winners. So buy up as much as possible and send them angry letters for discontinuing it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. Saved my life more than once !&lt;br /&gt;I am 28 and I should not have acne anymore. But when I am stressed I break out.&lt;br /&gt;This hydrating treatment clears my skin in 2 days max and if I use it everyday, the break out is limited. Plus my skin is never dry because it hydrates!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much out of this product because I&#x27;ve tried so many other similar products and they never worked. But this one DID WORK!!! In the first couple of days my acnes actually got worse, but I knew it was how acid would work on my face so I continued to use it. And then miracle happened! My face now looks relatively clean now, and people around me really noticed the change! WOW.</li>
            <li> Best stuff out there for acne! Put it on my chest &amp; face after every shower and it clears my acne up and prevents future breakouts!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just devastated that this is so hard to find-- I tried contacting Neutrogena directly, and they just sent me a stock response. It&#x27;s the only thing that takes care of my adult acne and doesn&#x27;t totally dry out my skin. Neutrogena, bring it BACK!!!!</li>
            <li> this was the first product that I used that got rid of my facial acne and kept the acne from coming back. then, i found out Neutrogena discontinued it and now I am using Aveeno&#x27;s facial lotion that contains salicylic acid which works just as well but I would switch back to this if they ever decide to make it again because I like the smell of this better than Aveeno&#x27;s formula.</li>
            <li> This product did not work at reducing the acne. Some of the acne subsided on its own but left behind marks. I believe that I would have had clearer skin using no product at all.</li>
