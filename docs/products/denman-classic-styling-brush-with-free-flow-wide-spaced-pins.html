            <li>If you are thinking about purchasing this brush, just stop thinking, place it in your cart and hit &amp;#34;Place Order&amp;#34; because this is an amazing brush!</li>
            <li>However, the results aren&#x27;t nearly as remarkable as they tend to be for people with looser curl patterns.</li>
            <li>I use it on my hair every night, really good for detangling and its easy on my curls. :D</li>
            <li>bought the D-31 brush, which is supposed to be good for detangling curly and kinky hair.</li>
            <li>GOOD NEWS:</li>

            <li>This Denman feels like a good quality brush.</li>
            <li>So just to be fair and do a hesitant review without hyperbole I want to put some specs out that no one seems to mention:    </li>

            <li>I liked the fact the bristles were so spaced.</li>

            <li>I absolutely love this brush.</li>
            <li>What I love about this brush is the spacing design of the bristles.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure once I use it</li>
            <li>I will be satisfied.  </li>

            <li>I love this brush..</li>
            <li>I love how the Denmans don&#x27;t have the balls on the tips of their brushes.</li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love how it clumps my curls ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
            <li>I made sure to run the rubber part of the brush against my hair as directed.</li>
            <li>It was shipped most expeditiously.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for many years.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>I really love this denman brush.</li>
            <li>I just want healthy, well-groomed hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got more to do than style my hair; this brush is a mainstay, a keeper.</li>
            <li>Even my grand-babies love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And how many times have you used it?</li>
            <li>I dislike detangling my hair, it takes well into 30 minutes or more to do.</li>
            <li>but I sincerely I don&#x27;t know how to braid and twists</li>
            <li>I love this hairbrush.  </li>
            <li>Love using it.</li>
            <li>Could not have asked for a better brush.</li>
            <li>I hope order more.</li>
            <li>It  massages my scalp which I love.</li>
            <li>I love my brushes.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>I love love LOVE this brush</li>
            <li>The tangles are successfully removed and her hair looks much</li>
            <li>Easy for many hair styles.</li>
            <li>It too submitted to this brush but it did so way more easily than the D3.</li>
            <li>This brush is awesome and does the job even better than my wide tooth comb</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very nice brush for natural hair but as a 4c girl I&#x27;d be happiest if the teeth where even more spaced out.</li>
            <li>They hurt my scalp, but I think with more use they will blunt a bit and be fine.</li>
            <li>Great brush for natural AA hair.</li>
            <li>I have one in the shower as well - perfect for combing conditioner through wet hair.</li>
            <li>Great for my natural hair.</li>
            <li>This brush is good when I am brushing my 4c hair in the shower after conditioning - the ONLY thing I wish it had is a better handle!</li>
            <li>It has a pretty good grip and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>And her hair just doesn&#x27;t detangle easily as do</li>
            <li>/&gt;After 16 years of struggles with her, we can finally grow her hair to a more flattering length while giving her joy with the brushings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to all who wrote reviews</li>
            <li>Easy detangling my hair.</li>
            <li>but it did easily.</li>
            <li>strong, and durable.</li>
            <li>I must honestly say that this brush has improved my styling and made life so much easier!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s still the beautiful red color and has yet to turn adobe.</li>
            <li>I gently wash out the excess product without messing with my hair too much with my fingers because I don&#x27;t want to undo the beautiful clumping and make it frizzy again.</li>
            <li>The 7 row brush is not very easy on you scalp compasred to the 9 row brush which is excellent!!</li>
            <li>The bristles are thicker and more spaced out, as well as super sturdy</li>
            <li>The brush is light, compact and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Just like the cheap Goody brush</li>
            <li>and It&#x27;s easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>I also appreciate that they are easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Smooth.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to the hands.</li>
            <li>I use the Remington Tangle Tamer first to easily and mostly painlessly get all of my daughters tangles out, then use this to style it.</li>
            <li>Love this brush , price was right too, now that I&#x27;ve had my doubts put to rest.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t that happy with it, but it does a decent job</li>
            <li>On the plus side, it didn&#x27;t tangle, but good heavens, if you have any but the most modest amount of very fine hair, the operative word is clearly:</li>
            <li>The brush came in what looked like the original packaging, but there was a hair caught in the casing.</li>
            <li>Glad we can still get them online - Thanks Burmax and Amazon!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through so many brushes and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Good for curly and straight hair, whether real hair or weave</li>
            <li>It is nothing special, not like the video bloggers on youtube would have you believe.</li>
            <li>I used this brush for the first time a few days ago and I am very happy with its performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before</li>
            <li>this is great for detangling, while wet of course.</li>
            <li>Now that my hair is much longer, the brush is actually more convenient to use with my 3c 4a hair.</li>
            <li>I guess it is an ok brush but don&#x27;t expect too much from something like a rubber and plastic brush.</li>
            <li>I am able to brush my hair without much loss breakage.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a better quality brush than you can get in most local stores and after reading many reviews go this one and am happy with the quality, but the tips are a bit hard.</li>
            <li>MY LAST DENMAN BRUSH LASTED FOR TEN YEARS; SO, THE QUALITY IS EXCELLENT!  </li>
            <li>We used to be able to buy these state side at most professional beauty supply stores - not so much anymore.</li>
            <li>I have just received my very first Denman brush.</li>
            <li>It was so easy to brush the tangles gently from my ends.</li>
            <li>Absolutely recommend this brush!!</li>
            <li>I have kinky curly, fine hair, and thought this would work, but even after trying to remove some of the bristles it pulls too much hair out.</li>
            <li>Detangling fine wavy hair is already challenging enough, without the brush falling apart on you!</li>
            <li>I find myself using it more than my wide tooth comb. :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny</li>
            <li>It has a nice solid grip, as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not they dynamo hair-brushing experience that I was expecting after reading so many comments, &amp; with all the YouTube natural hair people.  </li>
            <li>It would probably work better if all of my hair was natural as I&#x27;ve seen on youtube videos and reviews, so I will give this 3 stars assuming this is the case.</li>
            <li>Very solid construction and looks nice on my vanity.</li>
            <li>It is worth the price.</li>
            <li>This brush is well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Works good on wet hair too.</li>
            <li>I love this brush for detangling my natural hair.  </li>
            <li>I was able to modify the brush to my liking and put it back together pretty easily.  </li>
            <li>I cannot say that I find it to be superior to any other hair brush that I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair before.  </li>
            <li>Use it right</li>
            <li>The wide bristles are perfect for long scraggly hair.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a natural looking to purchase a Denman for detangling the D-31 is good for detangling ALL TYPES (but preferably short to medium length curly hair).</li>
            <li>Specifically made for thick or coarse hair and does a great job also easy to clean.</li>
            <li>At this point I don&#x27;t feel like its my &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; brush and its not the first tool i reach for when detangling my hair.  </li>
            <li>The brushes bristles are spaced out more then a regular brush</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I only want to detangle it, stimulate my scalp, and make sure that my products are evenly distributed.   </li>
            <li>Top that with the handle is a bit short in my hand and you get 4 stars.  </li>
            <li>and I tell you this is only slightly better than that one.</li>
            <li>Detangles very well, helps define my curls, pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>Seems like the more I brushed my hair with this brush (with leave in conditioner in it)</li>
            <li>Simply put, I love it.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t think it could work with my kinky hair type</li>
            <li>I decide to put my faith alone in the FreeFlow Denman and did not even pick up my D3 first.</li>
            <li>Just to be sure, I&#x27;ll time myself next time.</li>
            <li>: I believe this should be your first Denman brush</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>My hair is most likely 4a that I deliberately underprocess using a relaxer (texlax).</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to try a Denman brush because relaxed women are notoriously not into Denman brushes, but I finally decided to give it a try realizing that my hair seems to respond better to products and techniques geared towards naturals.</li>
            <li>After my big chop I was searching for appropriate styling tools that wouldn&#x27;t damage my hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks Denman!</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase and the 4/b parts of my hair definitely tighten up into nice spiral coils after use (wet), but the brush doesn&#x27;t do much with the 4/c portions.</li>
            <li>It perfectly detangles my daughter&#x27;s extremely thick, curly and long hair (perfect on coarse African American hair) and</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t get a fair impression but definitely was taken back by the fact my scalp was getting felt up by this brush.</li>
            <li>This is not my first Denman brush, but it is certainly the cheapest I have obtained, and I have not seen any difference in build quality.</li>
            <li>I have fine 3C hair and it pulls it out if I&#x27;m not very careful.</li>
            <li>works great on natural African American hair.</li>
            <li>Its soft enought to be gentle with natural hair but durable enough to get a good brush through your head of hair and get tangles out</li>
            <li>Previous to that I had no idea it existed and was so popular.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced breakage, but again, would never use this on my dry hair, or on my wet hair unless it already had conditioner and/or moisturizer in it and had already been combed in the shower.</li>
            <li>I just washed it, a few times (LOL), and it was everything the reviews promised once I actually got to use it!</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s a step above the cheap Goody brush but not by much.</li>
            <li>I love the pink rubber where the rounded bristles poke out.</li>
            <li>I really like it and use it all the time now.</li>
            <li>This brush really helped me get through my hair.</li>
            <li>This brush along, with a lot of conditioner, really helped me untangle knots and get my hair tammed.</li>
            <li>It was only after those steps did not I feel comfortable using the Denman brush on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes brushing my hair so much easier.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy bristles.</li>
            <li>Really like it, with caveats.</li>
            <li>Its very sturdy and the bristles are removeable.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush.</li>
            <li>I have two of those cheap Goody orange and white brushes that people use to make a modified Denman</li>
            <li>I expected more from a name brand brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really appreciate the the bristles are flexible so it does not tear at my hair.</li>
            <li>It is much gentler than using a wide-tooth comb to detangle.  </li>
            <li>VERY WELL</li>
            <li>My wide tooth comb &amp; fingers do a much better detangling job.</li>
            <li>I highly recomend 4a-c&#x27;s buy this brush!</li>
            <li>I use it during wash week or when i need my hair straight.</li>
            <li>I also enjoy the fact that cleaning the brush is quite simple.</li>
            <li>sometimes I am still gentle because i dont want to break it  because its not like you pay $2 for it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s surprisingly gentle considering all of the bristles.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this brush if you have a really itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>But if it&#x27;s too noisy or you&#x27;re losing hair - especially strands that are shorter than the general length of the hair on your head - I would take it to mean the brush was ripping at your hair and not the best match.</li>
            <li>Nice for natural african american hair.</li>
            <li>i love the option of making it wider, all u do is slide it up, and remove the teeth, press close, and slide it down into the brush.</li>
            <li>The black handle is cute too, with the gold-plated writing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>fav tool every though now I mainly finger comb</li>
            <li>only difference is that the teeth are spaced further apart which is why it is supposed to be better for afro hair.</li>
            <li>It is a decent brush.  </li>
            <li>I mainly use this brush to tighten my wrap at night.</li>
            <li>I find that this brush is good for removing any access shed hair or helping to detangle wet hair after i use a wide tooth comb.</li>
            <li>This Denman brush is remarkable and  it detangles my kinky, coily, 4b/c hair with no breakage - only the usual shedding.</li>
            <li>Will buy another and highly recommend for curly hair.</li>
            <li>Despite this flaw I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Natural hair saver!!</li>
            <li>But after a little cleaning I use it on my sister in turn out to be a ok brush</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the extra expense.</li>
            <li>I have very kinky hair and its also a pretty short afro now.</li>
            <li>One problem: after about 8-12 months of normal every day use the plastic handle cracks &amp; eventually brakes off.</li>
            <li>and I am surprised that Sallys nor any other retailer with a hair section has not picked up their own stock of these specific brushes.</li>
            <li>I have found the ~8 dollar price tag + free shipping to be cheaper than any other supplier of denman brushes.  </li>
            <li>My hair type and length: 4C, my kitchen (area from my nape up) is a beast, hair by my forehead and ears is like 4B-4A. My hair barely meets at my shoulders in front but in the back the hair on my nape brushes the top of my back.  </li>
            <li>Brand new.</li>
            <li>A new cream, elixir, co-wash, tool comes out every month, all swearing to be the &amp;#34;end-all&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I get more use out of it when my hair is dry, i.e. blow out and/or flat ironed.</li>
            <li>So I did some twists after the first time I used the brush and wore the twists in a ponytail to stretch my hair, then 2 weeks later unravel them for my friend&#x27;s graduation party.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if the short length of my hair (4 - 5 inches straight) makes this brush ineffective, but I suspect it works better on a looser curl pattern (4b or looser).</li>
            <li>The bristles are just far enough apart to where it easily runs to my hair when wet and conditioned, but the bristles don&#x27;t bend,as what is happening with my modified D3.  </li>
            <li>Having never owned a real Denman I have found that this product is both sturdy towards my thick natural hair which leads to easy detangling</li>
            <li>I had purchased a cheap imitation from Sally&#x27;s beauty supply store because the sales person told me that it was the same, but let me start off by telling you that this Denman brand lives up to its name, the cheap imitation that I bought is not even close to the quality of this brush.</li>
            <li>I originally bought the D3 and modified the bristles to make them slightly farther apart.  </li>
            <li>this clearly isn&#x27;t a detangling brush</li>
            <li>I have natural hair and this has been my saver for my hair.</li>
            <li>I have been transitioning to natural for over a year now</li>
            <li>so when I say my hair is sensitive to the use of styling tools (e.g. combs and bushes, it&#x27;s no joke).</li>
            <li>but I found the spacing of the pins to be to close for my natural hair</li>
            <li>Learned about this brush on natural haircare forums.</li>
            <li>Definitely an old skool brush</li>
            <li>I HAVE NATURAL CURLY HAIR, NOT</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural 3C texture.</li>
            <li>I have natural afro textured hair...</li>
            <li>but so far I don&#x27;t feel that I need to.</li>
            <li>This brush completely delivers what it promises.</li>
            <li>I have all natural hair, 4b/4c and</li>
            <li>This denham brush does the job for natural 4b hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I splurged on it a bit because it allows me to brush my natural hair (when wet) with minimal shedding or breakage.</li>
            <li>: I have used it twice so far.  </li>
            <li>: Yes, I have a really old D3 that doesn&#x27;t even look like they do today and the newer version.  </li>
            <li>I just wear a wild Afro and sleep on a satin pillowcase</li>
            <li>It works beautifully; and now she enjoys being brushed (no more squiriming and crying from her or me!)  </li>
            <li>Also, be aware that the brush head slides out sometimes when I detangle, but this isn&#x27;t a big problem and actually makes cleaning the brush easier.</li>
            <li>This brush broke in half the very first time I used it, after about 7 or 8 strokes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used imitation brushes that have slipped right out of the handle and lost it&#x27;s needles</li>
            <li>After showering, when my hair is still pretty damp (but not dripping wet) and I&#x27;ve worked in moisturizer, I use this brush to work out any leftover tangles and distribute product.</li>
            <li>I thought about modifying this brush when I first bought it so that it wouldn&#x27;t be rough on my strands</li>
            <li>The first time I used this, I was of course doing a wet dangle.</li>
            <li>My hair routine consists of using a large tooth shower comb for the majority of the detangling and only using the Denman when I encounter a knot that I cannot resolve with my fingers only.  </li>
            <li>It even gets through my new growth with such ease.</li>
            <li>Love this brush, a game changer for working with my natural 4c hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is thick, kinky and easily tangled.</li>
            <li>DENMAN brushes are by far superior to the Goody brushes i have dangerously raked through my kinky hair.</li>
            <li>I specifically choose this one because the bristles are more spaced out, which I take to mean as it is gentler than the standard Denman brush.</li>
            <li>this brush mad detangling my 3c/4a hair much easier, faster, and effective than finger detangling.</li>
            <li>I have multiple textures on my natural kinky hair ranging from 3C to 4B.  </li>
            <li>And only since Ive become natural have i wanted to use this.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this brush to anyone with curly or natural hair.  </li>
            <li>You simply must have one of these in you natural hair collection..</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t lose nearly as much hair with this brush as I have with other combs and brushes.</li>
            <li>I am African American with natural hair.</li>
            <li>The bristles are enough to detangle my hair, but not too many bristles to cause unnecessary manipulation and hair loss.</li>
            <li>I have rather coarse, thick hair, and the fine-toothed combs commonly available just don&#x27;t work as they should for my hair.</li>
            <li>I mainly use it on the ends after using the wide tooth comb.</li>
            <li>Although my hair is technically relaxed, it looks and behaves more like natural hair than relaxed hair, and tangles up pretty badly.</li>
            <li>How long have you been natural?</li>
            <li>hair is natural and I sometimes air dry it</li>
            <li>I had half an hour to get ready and another to get to this interview.</li>
            <li>KINKY BUT FINE, THIN CURLS</li>
            <li>On the other hand, the D-41 is the better choice for THICK, or medium length to long hair.</li>

            <li> However, the results aren&#x27;t nearly as remarkable as they tend to be for people with looser curl patterns.</li>
            <li> I use it on my hair every night, really good for detangling and its easy on my curls. :D</li>
            <li> bought the D-31 brush, which is supposed to be good for detangling curly and kinky hair.</li>
            <li> GOOD NEWS:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard nothing but good things about Denman brushes.  </li>
            <li> A good quality bush.</li>
            <li> I cannot recommend the item although the quality is good for what you get.</li>
            <li> This Denman feels like a good quality brush.</li>
            <li> So just to be fair and do a hesitant review without hyperbole I want to put some specs out that no one seems to mention:    </li>

            <li> I liked the fact the bristles were so spaced.</li>
            <li> Since I got her this brush, she can handle her hair on her own.</li>

            <li> I just want healthy, well-groomed hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got more to do than style my hair; this brush is a mainstay, a keeper.</li>
            <li> Even my grand-babies love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And how many times have you used it?</li>
            <li> I dislike detangling my hair, it takes well into 30 minutes or more to do.</li>
            <li> but I sincerely I don&#x27;t know how to braid and twists</li>
            <li> I love this hairbrush.  </li>
            <li> Love using it.</li>
            <li> Could not have asked for a better brush.</li>
            <li> I hope order more.</li>
            <li> It  massages my scalp which I love.</li>
            <li> I love my brushes.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> I love love LOVE this brush</li>
            <li> The tangles are successfully removed and her hair looks much</li>
            <li> Easy for many hair styles.</li>
            <li> It too submitted to this brush but it did so way more easily than the D3.</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome and does the job even better than my wide tooth comb</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice brush for natural hair but as a 4c girl I&#x27;d be happiest if the teeth where even more spaced out.</li>
            <li> They hurt my scalp, but I think with more use they will blunt a bit and be fine.</li>
            <li> Great brush for natural AA hair.</li>
            <li> I have one in the shower as well - perfect for combing conditioner through wet hair.</li>
            <li> Great for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> This brush is good when I am brushing my 4c hair in the shower after conditioning - the ONLY thing I wish it had is a better handle!</li>
            <li> It has a pretty good grip and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> And her hair just doesn&#x27;t detangle easily as do</li>
            <li> /&gt;After 16 years of struggles with her, we can finally grow her hair to a more flattering length while giving her joy with the brushings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to all who wrote reviews</li>
            <li> Easy detangling my hair.</li>
            <li> but it did easily.</li>
            <li> strong, and durable.</li>
            <li> I must honestly say that this brush has improved my styling and made life so much easier!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s still the beautiful red color and has yet to turn adobe.</li>
            <li> I gently wash out the excess product without messing with my hair too much with my fingers because I don&#x27;t want to undo the beautiful clumping and make it frizzy again.</li>
            <li> The 7 row brush is not very easy on you scalp compasred to the 9 row brush which is excellent!!</li>
            <li> The bristles are thicker and more spaced out, as well as super sturdy</li>
            <li> The brush is light, compact and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Just like the cheap Goody brush</li>
            <li> and It&#x27;s easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> I also appreciate that they are easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Smooth.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to the hands.</li>
            <li> I use the Remington Tangle Tamer first to easily and mostly painlessly get all of my daughters tangles out, then use this to style it.</li>
            <li> Love this brush , price was right too, now that I&#x27;ve had my doubts put to rest.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t that happy with it, but it does a decent job</li>
            <li> On the plus side, it didn&#x27;t tangle, but good heavens, if you have any but the most modest amount of very fine hair, the operative word is clearly:</li>
            <li> The brush came in what looked like the original packaging, but there was a hair caught in the casing.</li>
            <li> Glad we can still get them online - Thanks Burmax and Amazon!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through so many brushes and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Good for curly and straight hair, whether real hair or weave</li>
            <li> It is nothing special, not like the video bloggers on youtube would have you believe.</li>
            <li> I used this brush for the first time a few days ago and I am very happy with its performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before</li>
            <li> this is great for detangling, while wet of course.</li>
            <li> Now that my hair is much longer, the brush is actually more convenient to use with my 3c 4a hair.</li>
            <li> I guess it is an ok brush but don&#x27;t expect too much from something like a rubber and plastic brush.</li>
            <li> I am able to brush my hair without much loss breakage.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a better quality brush than you can get in most local stores and after reading many reviews go this one and am happy with the quality, but the tips are a bit hard.</li>
            <li> MY LAST DENMAN BRUSH LASTED FOR TEN YEARS; SO, THE QUALITY IS EXCELLENT!  </li>
            <li> We used to be able to buy these state side at most professional beauty supply stores - not so much anymore.</li>
            <li> I have just received my very first Denman brush.</li>
            <li> It was so easy to brush the tangles gently from my ends.</li>
            <li> Absolutely recommend this brush!!</li>
            <li> I have kinky curly, fine hair, and thought this would work, but even after trying to remove some of the bristles it pulls too much hair out.</li>
            <li> Detangling fine wavy hair is already challenging enough, without the brush falling apart on you!</li>
            <li> I find myself using it more than my wide tooth comb. :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny</li>
            <li> It has a nice solid grip, as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not they dynamo hair-brushing experience that I was expecting after reading so many comments, &amp; with all the YouTube natural hair people.  </li>
            <li> It would probably work better if all of my hair was natural as I&#x27;ve seen on youtube videos and reviews, so I will give this 3 stars assuming this is the case.</li>
            <li> Very solid construction and looks nice on my vanity.</li>
            <li> It is worth the price.</li>
            <li> This brush is well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Works good on wet hair too.</li>
            <li> I love this brush for detangling my natural hair.  </li>
            <li> I was able to modify the brush to my liking and put it back together pretty easily.  </li>
            <li> I cannot say that I find it to be superior to any other hair brush that I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair before.  </li>
            <li> Use it right</li>
            <li> The wide bristles are perfect for long scraggly hair.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a natural looking to purchase a Denman for detangling the D-31 is good for detangling ALL TYPES (but preferably short to medium length curly hair).</li>
            <li> Specifically made for thick or coarse hair and does a great job also easy to clean.</li>
            <li> At this point I don&#x27;t feel like its my &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; brush and its not the first tool i reach for when detangling my hair.  </li>
            <li> The brushes bristles are spaced out more then a regular brush</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I only want to detangle it, stimulate my scalp, and make sure that my products are evenly distributed.   </li>
            <li> Top that with the handle is a bit short in my hand and you get 4 stars.  </li>
            <li> and I tell you this is only slightly better than that one.</li>
            <li> Detangles very well, helps define my curls, pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Seems like the more I brushed my hair with this brush (with leave in conditioner in it)</li>
            <li> Simply put, I love it.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think it could work with my kinky hair type</li>
            <li> I decide to put my faith alone in the FreeFlow Denman and did not even pick up my D3 first.</li>
            <li> Just to be sure, I&#x27;ll time myself next time.</li>
            <li> : I believe this should be your first Denman brush</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> My hair is most likely 4a that I deliberately underprocess using a relaxer (texlax).</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try a Denman brush because relaxed women are notoriously not into Denman brushes, but I finally decided to give it a try realizing that my hair seems to respond better to products and techniques geared towards naturals.</li>
            <li> After my big chop I was searching for appropriate styling tools that wouldn&#x27;t damage my hair.</li>
            <li> Thanks Denman!</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase and the 4/b parts of my hair definitely tighten up into nice spiral coils after use (wet), but the brush doesn&#x27;t do much with the 4/c portions.</li>
            <li> It perfectly detangles my daughter&#x27;s extremely thick, curly and long hair (perfect on coarse African American hair) and</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get a fair impression but definitely was taken back by the fact my scalp was getting felt up by this brush.</li>
            <li> This is not my first Denman brush, but it is certainly the cheapest I have obtained, and I have not seen any difference in build quality.</li>
            <li> I have fine 3C hair and it pulls it out if I&#x27;m not very careful.</li>
            <li> works great on natural African American hair.</li>
            <li> Its soft enought to be gentle with natural hair but durable enough to get a good brush through your head of hair and get tangles out</li>
            <li> Previous to that I had no idea it existed and was so popular.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced breakage, but again, would never use this on my dry hair, or on my wet hair unless it already had conditioner and/or moisturizer in it and had already been combed in the shower.</li>
            <li> I just washed it, a few times (LOL), and it was everything the reviews promised once I actually got to use it!</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s a step above the cheap Goody brush but not by much.</li>
            <li> I love the pink rubber where the rounded bristles poke out.</li>
            <li> I really like it and use it all the time now.</li>
            <li> This brush really helped me get through my hair.</li>
            <li> This brush along, with a lot of conditioner, really helped me untangle knots and get my hair tammed.</li>
            <li> It was only after those steps did not I feel comfortable using the Denman brush on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes brushing my hair so much easier.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy bristles.</li>
            <li> Really like it, with caveats.</li>
            <li> Its very sturdy and the bristles are removeable.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush.</li>
            <li> I have two of those cheap Goody orange and white brushes that people use to make a modified Denman</li>
            <li> I expected more from a name brand brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really appreciate the the bristles are flexible so it does not tear at my hair.</li>
            <li> It is much gentler than using a wide-tooth comb to detangle.  </li>
            <li> VERY WELL</li>
            <li> My wide tooth comb &amp; fingers do a much better detangling job.</li>
            <li> I highly recomend 4a-c&#x27;s buy this brush!</li>
            <li> I use it during wash week or when i need my hair straight.</li>
            <li> I also enjoy the fact that cleaning the brush is quite simple.</li>
            <li> sometimes I am still gentle because i dont want to break it  because its not like you pay $2 for it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s surprisingly gentle considering all of the bristles.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this brush if you have a really itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> But if it&#x27;s too noisy or you&#x27;re losing hair - especially strands that are shorter than the general length of the hair on your head - I would take it to mean the brush was ripping at your hair and not the best match.</li>
            <li> Nice for natural african american hair.</li>
            <li> i love the option of making it wider, all u do is slide it up, and remove the teeth, press close, and slide it down into the brush.</li>
            <li> The black handle is cute too, with the gold-plated writing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> fav tool every though now I mainly finger comb</li>
            <li> only difference is that the teeth are spaced further apart which is why it is supposed to be better for afro hair.</li>
            <li> It is a decent brush.  </li>
            <li> I mainly use this brush to tighten my wrap at night.</li>
            <li> I find that this brush is good for removing any access shed hair or helping to detangle wet hair after i use a wide tooth comb.</li>
            <li> This Denman brush is remarkable and  it detangles my kinky, coily, 4b/c hair with no breakage - only the usual shedding.</li>
            <li> Will buy another and highly recommend for curly hair.</li>
            <li> Despite this flaw I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Natural hair saver!!</li>
            <li> But after a little cleaning I use it on my sister in turn out to be a ok brush</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the extra expense.</li>
            <li> I have very kinky hair and its also a pretty short afro now.</li>
            <li> One problem: after about 8-12 months of normal every day use the plastic handle cracks &amp; eventually brakes off.</li>
            <li> and I am surprised that Sallys nor any other retailer with a hair section has not picked up their own stock of these specific brushes.</li>
            <li> I have found the ~8 dollar price tag + free shipping to be cheaper than any other supplier of denman brushes.  </li>
            <li> My hair type and length: 4C, my kitchen (area from my nape up) is a beast, hair by my forehead and ears is like 4B-4A. My hair barely meets at my shoulders in front but in the back the hair on my nape brushes the top of my back.  </li>
            <li> Brand new.</li>
            <li> A new cream, elixir, co-wash, tool comes out every month, all swearing to be the &amp;#34;end-all&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I get more use out of it when my hair is dry, i.e. blow out and/or flat ironed.</li>
            <li> So I did some twists after the first time I used the brush and wore the twists in a ponytail to stretch my hair, then 2 weeks later unravel them for my friend&#x27;s graduation party.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if the short length of my hair (4 - 5 inches straight) makes this brush ineffective, but I suspect it works better on a looser curl pattern (4b or looser).</li>
            <li> The bristles are just far enough apart to where it easily runs to my hair when wet and conditioned, but the bristles don&#x27;t bend,as what is happening with my modified D3.  </li>
            <li> Having never owned a real Denman I have found that this product is both sturdy towards my thick natural hair which leads to easy detangling</li>
            <li> I had purchased a cheap imitation from Sally&#x27;s beauty supply store because the sales person told me that it was the same, but let me start off by telling you that this Denman brand lives up to its name, the cheap imitation that I bought is not even close to the quality of this brush.</li>
            <li> I originally bought the D3 and modified the bristles to make them slightly farther apart.  </li>
            <li> this clearly isn&#x27;t a detangling brush</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and this has been my saver for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been transitioning to natural for over a year now</li>
            <li> so when I say my hair is sensitive to the use of styling tools (e.g. combs and bushes, it&#x27;s no joke).</li>
            <li> but I found the spacing of the pins to be to close for my natural hair</li>
            <li> Learned about this brush on natural haircare forums.</li>
            <li> Definitely an old skool brush</li>
            <li> I HAVE NATURAL CURLY HAIR, NOT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural 3C texture.</li>
            <li> I have natural afro textured hair...</li>
            <li> but so far I don&#x27;t feel that I need to.</li>
            <li> This brush completely delivers what it promises.</li>
            <li> I have all natural hair, 4b/4c and</li>
            <li> This denham brush does the job for natural 4b hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I splurged on it a bit because it allows me to brush my natural hair (when wet) with minimal shedding or breakage.</li>
            <li> : I have used it twice so far.  </li>
            <li> : Yes, I have a really old D3 that doesn&#x27;t even look like they do today and the newer version.  </li>
            <li> I just wear a wild Afro and sleep on a satin pillowcase</li>
            <li> It works beautifully; and now she enjoys being brushed (no more squiriming and crying from her or me!)  </li>
            <li> Also, be aware that the brush head slides out sometimes when I detangle, but this isn&#x27;t a big problem and actually makes cleaning the brush easier.</li>
            <li> This brush broke in half the very first time I used it, after about 7 or 8 strokes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used imitation brushes that have slipped right out of the handle and lost it&#x27;s needles</li>
            <li> After showering, when my hair is still pretty damp (but not dripping wet) and I&#x27;ve worked in moisturizer, I use this brush to work out any leftover tangles and distribute product.</li>
            <li> I thought about modifying this brush when I first bought it so that it wouldn&#x27;t be rough on my strands</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, I was of course doing a wet dangle.</li>
            <li> My hair routine consists of using a large tooth shower comb for the majority of the detangling and only using the Denman when I encounter a knot that I cannot resolve with my fingers only.  </li>
            <li> It even gets through my new growth with such ease.</li>
            <li> Love this brush, a game changer for working with my natural 4c hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, kinky and easily tangled.</li>
            <li> DENMAN brushes are by far superior to the Goody brushes i have dangerously raked through my kinky hair.</li>
            <li> I specifically choose this one because the bristles are more spaced out, which I take to mean as it is gentler than the standard Denman brush.</li>
            <li> this brush mad detangling my 3c/4a hair much easier, faster, and effective than finger detangling.</li>
            <li> I have multiple textures on my natural kinky hair ranging from 3C to 4B.  </li>
            <li> And only since Ive become natural have i wanted to use this.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this brush to anyone with curly or natural hair.  </li>
            <li> You simply must have one of these in you natural hair collection..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t lose nearly as much hair with this brush as I have with other combs and brushes.</li>
            <li> I am African American with natural hair.</li>
            <li> The bristles are enough to detangle my hair, but not too many bristles to cause unnecessary manipulation and hair loss.</li>
            <li> I have rather coarse, thick hair, and the fine-toothed combs commonly available just don&#x27;t work as they should for my hair.</li>
            <li> I mainly use it on the ends after using the wide tooth comb.</li>
            <li> Although my hair is technically relaxed, it looks and behaves more like natural hair than relaxed hair, and tangles up pretty badly.</li>
            <li> How long have you been natural?</li>
            <li> hair is natural and I sometimes air dry it</li>
            <li> I had half an hour to get ready and another to get to this interview.</li>
            <li> KINKY BUT FINE, THIN CURLS</li>
            <li> On the other hand, the D-41 is the better choice for THICK, or medium length to long hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with curl definition for a very long time and finally purchased a Denman brush.</li>
            <li> I am a black woman that&#x27;s going natural..</li>
            <li> I use it on my dry hair only.</li>
            <li> The curl of my hair appeared no different than when I simply comb it with a wide tooth comb.</li>
            <li> I have the kinkest hair type on the spectrum (4c) and the majority of people I&#x27;ve seen using this brush (Youtube videos) have been of mixed race and/or had loose locks.</li>
            <li> It came to my house fast, but the brush is to hard on my hair.</li>
            <li> and it works wonders on my natural hair when wet!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using these brushes for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> I use it on her wet hair to brush it before it dries to help with the detangling process as well as for daily grooming.</li>
            <li> I WILL CONTINUE TO BUY IT FOR AS LONG AS IT IS AROUND!</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is that my hair tends to shed a lot into the bristles but other than that</li>
            <li> Then I pat dry with t-shirt and air dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten in a pool twice within these 2 weeks and my Fro shrinks but also starts feeling dry.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this denman brush for people with thick curly or kinky hair.</li>
            <li> I have 4c african american hair, and I have always had trouble detangling my hair before applying gel and other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black and have curly hair in back and wavy hair in front.</li>
            <li> This brush glides through me and my daughter&#x27;s hair whether it is wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and very curly.</li>
            <li> Hello slippery wet handle</li>
            <li> and it was getting harder to comb through it.</li>
            <li> You still have to be careful if you&#x27;re using it to detangle curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I did not have to &amp;#34;modify&amp;#34; it because of the wide spaces.</li>
            <li> I use it on my 4b/4c wet hair to help comb through the knots.</li>
            <li> This was money well spent.</li>
            <li> I never use it on wet hair as the bristles are still.</li>
            <li> This brush is not an empty promise.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this brush if you have natural thick hair like mines.</li>
            <li> Works well for detangling thick naturally curly hair, and making the curls &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> and everybody, especially if you have curly, coarse, thick hair.</li>
            <li> I use my Denman right after washing my hair, while it&#x27;s still wet and it detangles so perfectly in no time at all.</li>
            <li> From past experiences I have found that Denman brushes last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> For my tangled poodle with the difficult hair... she&#x27;s the only one whose hair just tangles all the time, in spite of frequent washings, deep conditionings, heavy conditioners, and leave in products.  </li>
            <li> I use both brushes now, this one to detangle and the other to achieve curls.</li>
            <li> This is my first Denman brush and will not allow any other sales person stir me in the wrong direction again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not interested.</li>
            <li> Do I have other Denmans?</li>
            <li> not like other brushes that pulls out hair.</li>
            <li> Same day I received my brush (7/12/15), I brushed a small section of my hair 4-5 times and to my surprise the handle broke in two!!</li>
            <li> It glides through wet, thick, curly hair with relative ease.</li>
            <li> Purchased it after a recommendation of an black hair care forum, and I have not used other brushes since.</li>
            <li> The quality is sturdy and the bristles are hard enough to help with detangling, etc.</li>
            <li> This brush is a staple in my hair care routine, and I would definitely recommend it for those of you with thick curly hair who want to detangle without hair loss.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat thick, coarse, relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick 4A/4B hair and styling is simple for me with the help of this brush and a little water.</li>
            <li> I have owned previous denman brush</li>
            <li> The brush is plastic, so it will typically make some noise when used on kinky hair (say, as compared to a boar bristle brush).</li>
            <li> The handle snapped off less than a week after I received it.  </li>
            <li> I have type 4 Black textured hair and my hair poses no problem for this brush.</li>
            <li> less fall out..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the shower, piling on the Aussie moist con and hoping I can rake through my pseudo matted hair in less than 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> My detangling process became shorter, faster, and less stressful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s officially my holy grail brush, no more wide toothed shower combs for me.</li>
            <li> No matter how thick, curly, tangled or long.</li>
            <li> but I wanted to try the 7 row brush recommended for tightly curled hair.  </li>
            <li> It is horribly hard for me to find a single brush to go through my hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very long, thick, curly hair</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull or snag like other brushes I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> It does the job with little hair loss.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice a lot of hair shedding when I use it, but there is usually a little shedding noted when I use it as opposed to my paddle brush (no shedding).</li>
            <li> Without the little balls on the tips of the plastic &amp;#34;fingers&amp;#34;, it doesn&#x27;t snag my hair at all</li>
            <li> I have been using these Denman brushes since I was a little girl.</li>
            <li> Finally figured out how to use it on my (thin, type 4) hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few washes since I&#x27;ve been using this brush.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and I still feel the pokeys from this brush, they are sharp.  </li>
            <li> I have fairly thick hair, but NEVER in over half a century</li>
            <li> This was a solution to modification on the D4 of Goody copy because since the rubber base was made to support the spaced bristles, the base was strong enough to rake through the hair thoroughly, give the user less work of working the handle, and the rubber base wouldn&#x27;t slip out because of stress against more hair than it was intended for.     </li>
            <li> Finger combed through a small section of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> No tangles, pulling, snagging, crying!  </li>
            <li> I recommend using this brush on small sections and brushing from the bottom up in slower, deliberate strokes.</li>
            <li> Bristles are hard plastic, spaced farther apart than preferred.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;or at least start you in that direction.</li>
            <li> I was going to be late to an interview.</li>
            <li> afro-textured hair is exceptionally thick; even when relaxed.</li>
            <li> Waste of money and frustrating.</li>
            <li> What grabbed me was that the brush said it was made for Afro and thick hair  </li>
            <li> the brush handle gets very slick.</li>
            <li> bristles are well spaced, but very stiff with no bend which is not ideal for relaxed hair.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> WHEN I FIRST USED THIS BRUSH, I HATED IT!</li>
            <li> Each and every time we try to use this brush, the red base slides out and the bristles fall out.  </li>
            <li> and you get the results you want, use it wrong, and your hair will let you know.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been difficult to deal with.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to hold onto it when the handle is wet or you are oiling your hair and your hands are oily :(</li>
            <li> ... WRONG!</li>
            <li> BAD NEWS:</li>
            <li> IDK who said these brushes are for our hair, but if you want your hair ripped out go ahead and try this brush :(</li>
            <li> the orange rubber part slides off of the base.</li>
            <li> Therefore, detangling was horrible for me - the brush was literally pulling my hair out with any amount of conditioner.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I never though a brush could be used to detangle my kinky hair. This brush is awesome and does the job even better than my wide tooth comb</li>
            <li> fav tool every though now I mainly finger comb BUT when I do use this I love it</li>
            <li> I was looking for a better quality brush than you can get in most local stores and after reading many reviews go this one and am happy with the quality, but the tips are a bit hard. They hurt my scalp, but I think with more use they will blunt a bit and be fine. It does seem a quality brush which I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll have for many years. My favorite comb I&#x27;ve had since I was a teenager (35 plus years).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the best looking brushes I&#x27;ve owned, and probably the best made. This brush is made in Great Britain, and is adorable. I love the pink rubber where the rounded bristles poke out. The black handle is cute too, with the gold-plated writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the D-31 brush, which is supposed to be good for detangling curly and kinky hair. (I am a 4A/4B type). If you&#x27;re a natural looking to purchase a Denman for detangling the D-31 is good for detangling ALL TYPES (but preferably short to medium length curly hair). On the other hand, the D-41 is the better choice for THICK, or medium length to long hair. I bought the D-31 because I thought it would be a better investment.</li>
            <li> May not be so great for my hair. I have fine 3C hair and it pulls it out if I&#x27;m not very careful.</li>
            <li> This brush is good when I am brushing my 4c hair in the shower after conditioning - the ONLY thing I wish it had is a better handle! Hello slippery wet handle lol It needs a rubber grip handle something. It&#x27;s impossible to hold onto it when the handle is wet or you are oiling your hair and your hands are oily :( If it weren&#x27;t for that, I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have 4b/4c hair and the brush is great for detangling/clearing out shed hair. However, the results aren&#x27;t nearly as remarkable as they tend to be for people with looser curl patterns. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase and the 4/b parts of my hair definitely tighten up into nice spiral coils after use (wet), but the brush doesn&#x27;t do much with the 4/c portions.</li>
            <li> Love this brush, will be buying a couple more, one for myself and my mom.</li>
            <li> This is a good brush and works ok for my transitioning hair.  At this point I don&#x27;t feel like its my &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; brush and its not the first tool i reach for when detangling my hair.  I get more use out of it when my hair is dry, i.e. blow out and/or flat ironed.</li>
            <li> The brush came in what looked like the original packaging, but there was a hair caught in the casing. I just washed it, a few times (LOL), and it was everything the reviews promised once I actually got to use it! I&#x27;m black and have curly hair in back and wavy hair in front. This brush is great for both textures.</li>
            <li> I am African American with natural hair. It is horribly hard for me to find a single brush to go through my hair. The brushes bristles are spaced out more then a regular brush so it allows my hair to be brushed easier. I really like it and use it all the time now.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush!!!</li>
            <li> Finally figured out how to use it on my (thin, type 4) hair. I bring it in the shower with me! I use lots of shampoo or conditioner just to get &amp;#34;good slip&amp;#34; then I brush it from the ends and work my up to the root. I leave the actual roots alone.  I gently wash out the excess product without messing with my hair too much with my fingers because I don&#x27;t want to undo the beautiful clumping and make it frizzy again. Then I pat dry with t-shirt and air dry.</li>
            <li> This brush is fab... I have been using these brushes for as long as I can remember. I love the product and so does my hair and scalp!</li>
            <li> works great on natural African American hair. my hair is a 4a/b and its coily this works great for my tighter coiled hair</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST BRUSH, AND I AM SO HAPPY TO HAVE FOUND IT ON AMAZON!  MY LAST DENMAN BRUSH LASTED FOR TEN YEARS; SO, THE QUALITY IS EXCELLENT!  I WILL CONTINUE TO BUY IT FOR AS LONG AS IT IS AROUND!</li>
            <li> Natural hair saver!! I have natural hair and this has been my saver for my hair. I use it mostly after I wash and condition my hair to help with the knots and tangles. I would recommend this brush if you have natural thick hair like mines.</li>
            <li> I have multiple textures on my natural kinky hair ranging from 3C to 4B.  This brush is perfect for styling and combing out any knots you may have.  I find myself using it more than my wide tooth comb. :)</li>
            <li> The package was already open when I opened the Amazon box. I bought this brush and took it out the already opened package and barley put it in my hair and the handle broke just snapped. If I could rate zero stars I would because I couldn&#x27;t use the brush at all.</li>
            <li> This brush really helped me get through my hair. I have been transitioning to natural for over a year now and it was getting harder to comb through it. This brush along, with a lot of conditioner, really helped me untangle knots and get my hair tammed. Absolutely recommend this brush!! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Love this product! My daughter is mixed and it defines her curls beautifully!</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping, A++</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It is great for detangling my transitioning hair. It doesn&#x27;t pull or snag like other brushes I&#x27;ve used in the past. This is definitely a staple for me now!</li>
            <li> The 7 row brush is not very easy on you scalp compasred to the 9 row brush which is excellent!!</li>
            <li> My number one concern when ordering this brush was whether or not it would be compatible with my afro-textured hair. I have the kinkest hair type on the spectrum (4c) and the majority of people I&#x27;ve seen using this brush (Youtube videos) have been of mixed race and/or had loose locks. When I ordered this brush, I intended to modify it by taking out some of the rows so that it would be gentler on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BAD NEWS: You cannot modify  this brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE GOOD NEWS: There&#x27;s no need to modify this brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is natural and I sometimes air dry it so when I say my hair is sensitive to the use of styling tools (e.g. combs and bushes, it&#x27;s no joke). I used this brush for the first time a few days ago and I am very happy with its performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using the Denman I:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Finger combed through a small section of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;2. Combed that same section with my Mebco Tortoise Shower Detangler (also ordered on Amazon)&lt;br /&gt;3. Used a second comb with smaller detangling teeth&lt;br /&gt;4.  It was only after those steps did not I feel comfortable using the Denman brush on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason that I did not give this brush 5 stars is because I would not give and comb/detangling tool five stars since combing my hair is not something I like to do lol. If I had it my way I would only use my fingers to detangle my hair, but I realize that is not possible since my fingers do not rid my head of shed hair the way combing through it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: Denman brushing is the closest I will ever come to combing my hair. Use it right and you get the results you want, use it wrong, and your hair will let you know.</li>
            <li> It makes brushing my hair so much easier. I have thick 4A/4B hair and styling is simple for me with the help of this brush and a little water.</li>
            <li> Nice for natural african american hair. Doesn&#x27;t give me the waves and curls that the traditional Denman gives but, it allows me to detangle alot easier. I use both brushes now, this one to detangle and the other to achieve curls.</li>
            <li> THe best brush ever for AA natural Hair. it does detangles my hair with the greatest of ease I love it.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy bristles. Good for curly and straight hair, whether real hair or weave</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush. Purchased it after a recommendation of an black hair care forum, and I have not used other brushes since. I have 4c african american hair, and I have always had trouble detangling my hair before applying gel and other products. What I love about this brush is the spacing design of the bristles. The bristles are enough to detangle my hair, but not too many bristles to cause unnecessary manipulation and hair loss. This brush is a staple in my hair care routine, and I would definitely recommend it for those of you with thick curly hair who want to detangle without hair loss.</li>
            <li> This brush glides through me and my daughter&#x27;s hair whether it is wet or dry.  No tangles, pulling, snagging, crying!  This is a keeper.  Would defiantly repurchase.</li>
            <li> Great brush for my 4b hair. Slides through without ripping the hair out of my scalp.</li>
            <li> I have 4c hair and my daughters have a mixture of 4a/4b/4c hair.  This works wonders on their hair. I originally bought the D3 and modified the bristles to make them slightly farther apart.  I really wasn&#x27;t that happy with it, but it does a decent job so I didn&#x27;t return it. Then I read and bought this brush and it&#x27;s soooo much better!  The bristles are just far enough apart to where it easily runs to my hair when wet and conditioned, but the bristles don&#x27;t bend,as what is happening with my modified D3.  And the curl definition I&#x27;ve gotten from my daughters&#x27; hair after using it is incredible.</li>
            <li> I received the brush timely and looks just like it did before I purchased.  Box and item are brandnew and look very good!  I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to actually use it yet...but I&#x27;m sure once I use it I will be satisfied.  I&#x27;ve heard nothing but good things about Denman brushes.  So I can&#x27;t wait to use it.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have owned previous denman brush but I found the spacing of the pins to be to close for my natural hair curly (4A hair - your curlies). Therefore, detangling was horrible for me - the brush was literally pulling my hair out with any amount of conditioner. But, I found this brush with wider spacing of the pins and now detangling is breeze.</li>
            <li> Learned about this brush on natural haircare forums. Really like it, with caveats. I condition my hair in the shower and use a wide-tooth comb to detangle. After showering, when my hair is still pretty damp (but not dripping wet) and I&#x27;ve worked in moisturizer, I use this brush to work out any leftover tangles and distribute product. It coils my kinks, slips through the kitchen, massages my head, and distributes my products. I haven&#x27;t experienced breakage, but again, would never use this on my dry hair, or on my wet hair unless it already had conditioner and/or moisturizer in it and had already been combed in the shower. My goal is not to straighten my hair, or to make it look curly vs. kinky ... I only want to detangle it, stimulate my scalp, and make sure that my products are evenly distributed.   The brush is plastic, so it will typically make some noise when used on kinky hair (say, as compared to a boar bristle brush). But if it&#x27;s too noisy or you&#x27;re losing hair - especially strands that are shorter than the general length of the hair on your head - I would take it to mean the brush was ripping at your hair and not the best match. The brush is light, compact and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I have several Denman brushes, but this is the only one that tends to scratch my scalp when I use it.</li>
            <li> this brush mad detangling my 3c/4a hair much easier, faster, and effective than finger detangling. The only problem I have is that I detangle with a lot of conditioner in my hair and the brush handle gets very slick. Top that with the handle is a bit short in my hand and you get 4 stars.  Also, be aware that the brush head slides out sometimes when I detangle, but this isn&#x27;t a big problem and actually makes cleaning the brush easier.</li>
            <li> This brush has been around for years. And only since Ive become natural have i wanted to use this. I havent used it yet but I&#x27;m looking forward to using it. Its very sturdy and the bristles are removeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen many reviews on this brush on YouTube and I had to get it to try it out for myself and it works wonders on my natural hair when wet!!!</li>
            <li> The handle snapped off less than a week after I received it.  I used it once.  I have no idea how that could happen, but it did.  I am not talking about a crack.  It broke off entirely.</li>
            <li> Because of the teeth being spaced apart, I think this is the best in the Denman Collection.  You still have to be careful if you&#x27;re using it to detangle curly hair.  A good quality bush.</li>
            <li> it works great! i love the option of making it wider, all u do is slide it up, and remove the teeth, press close, and slide it down into the brush.</li>
            <li> Now that my hair is much longer, the brush is actually more convenient to use with my 3c 4a hair.</li>
            <li> Definitely an old skool brush but if you style hair it is a must have in your collection. Easy for many hair styles. I just love it. Retro is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Great brush for natural AA hair. I&#x27;ve always needed a brush like this, and I&#x27;m so glad I found this one. I don&#x27;t lose nearly as much hair with this brush as I have with other combs and brushes. I recommend.</li>
            <li> This brush is great for detangling and distributing product through hair, makes my hair feel nice and smooth after using it.</li>
            <li> IDK who said these brushes are for our hair, but if you want your hair ripped out go ahead and try this brush :(</li>
            <li> I received it on time. It came well packaged and the quality is superb. I had purchased a cheap imitation from Sally&#x27;s beauty supply store because the sales person told me that it was the same, but let me start off by telling you that this Denman brand lives up to its name, the cheap imitation that I bought is not even close to the quality of this brush. The quality is sturdy and the bristles are hard enough to help with detangling, etc. but not hurt your scalp... This is my first Denman brush and will not allow any other sales person stir me in the wrong direction again. Thank goodness for a well made product. It exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> If you are African American and have coily or kinky this brush works wonders on detangling hair painlessly</li>
            <li> Amazing. It got here in two days and it has the box and everything. Brand new. I use it every week.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush. It has the bigger spaces so it is perfect for my hair and my daughters&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I fell for all the hype for this brush. It is nothing special, not like the video bloggers on youtube would have you believe. I have two of those cheap Goody orange and white brushes that people use to make a modified Denman and I tell you this is only slightly better than that one. Just like the cheap Goody brush the orange rubber part slides off of the base. I expected more from a name brand brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only difference is that the teeth are spaced further apart which is why it is supposed to be better for afro hair. So it&#x27;s a step above the cheap Goody brush but not by much. I guess it is an ok brush but don&#x27;t expect too much from something like a rubber and plastic brush.</li>
            <li> This brush defines my curls when used on damp hair after applying hair products.</li>
            <li> Works well for detangling thick naturally curly hair, and making the curls &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have kinky curly, fine hair, and thought this would work, but even after trying to remove some of the bristles it pulls too much hair out. I will only use once in a while with lots of leave in conditioner for easier glide through.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a believer in Denman and used their products my entire life, however, this is not a brush I recommend to the tender-or-not-so tender headed.  It hurts the scalp to use it.  Bristles are hard plastic, spaced farther apart than preferred.  I cannot recommend the item although the quality is good for what you get.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few washes since I&#x27;ve been using this brush. I LOVE it! Having never owned a real Denman I have found that this product is both sturdy towards my thick natural hair which leads to easy detangling and It&#x27;s easy to clean.  It&#x27;s worth every penny and I recommend this to the max!</li>
            <li> Great at detangling my hair.</li>
            <li> I have owned Denman brushes before but I wanted to try the 7 row brush recommended for tightly curled hair.  It is a decent brush.  My hair routine consists of using a large tooth shower comb for the majority of the detangling and only using the Denman when I encounter a knot that I cannot resolve with my fingers only.  It does the job with little hair loss. I have found the ~8 dollar price tag + free shipping to be cheaper than any other supplier of denman brushes.  From past experiences I have found that Denman brushes last a very long time.  I also appreciate that they are easy to clean.  It has a nice solid grip, as well. I really appreciate the the bristles are flexible so it does not tear at my hair.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this brush to anyone with curly or natural hair.  I had to modify it by removing three of the rows.  It is much gentler than using a wide-tooth comb to detangle.  It&#x27;s worth the extra expense. I wish I had bought it sooner.</li>
            <li> My daughter has 4a/4b. I use the Remington Tangle Tamer first to easily and mostly painlessly get all of my daughters tangles out, then use this to style it. I love it.</li>
            <li> WHEN I FIRST USED THIS BRUSH, I HATED IT! I HAVE NATURAL CURLY HAIR, NOT KINKY BUT FINE, THIN CURLS SO THIS BRUSH HURT WHEN I USED IT. I GAVE IT ANOTHER TRY AND WITH MORE CONDITIONER AND IT DOESN&#x27;T HURT ANYMORE. IT DE-TANGLES VERY WELL AND IT CUT MY DE-TANGLING TIME IN THE SHOWER.</li>
            <li> Love this brush for detangling. I did not have to &amp;#34;modify&amp;#34; it because of the wide spaces.</li>
            <li> Great brush for think or curly hair - hair doesn&#x27;t get caught on the ends of each bristle.</li>
            <li> Love this brush , price was right too, now that I&#x27;ve had my doubts put to rest.&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was a lot for a brush, however this is not JUST a brush, this is a DENMAN !!.&lt;br /&gt; No matter how thick, curly, tangled or long. THIS brush, can make a beautiful Rapunzel head of hair&lt;br /&gt;or at least start you in that direction. You&#x27;ll have a partner that&#x27;s on your side, to bring out &amp;#34;THE BEAUTY&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;in you.  If this review has helped, please click yes below. All reviewers appreciate feedback Thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural 3C texture. I&#x27;ve been struggling with curl definition for a very long time and finally purchased a Denman brush. I must honestly say that this brush has improved my styling and made life so much easier!</li>
            <li> This brush is ok.  My hair is thick and I still feel the pokeys from this brush, they are sharp.  It&#x27;s not my favorite brush and I wouldn&#x27;t buy another one.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.. I am a black woman that&#x27;s going natural.. A MUST HAVE for us!!! I use it on my 4b/4c wet hair to help comb through the knots. It&#x27;s definitely does the job well without pulling all my hair out..</li>
            <li> This brush broke in half the very first time I used it, after about 7 or 8 strokes. I have fairly thick hair, but NEVER in over half a century have I had a hairbrush BREAK on me!  On the plus side, it didn&#x27;t tangle, but good heavens, if you have any but the most modest amount of very fine hair, the operative word is clearly: Beware!</li>
            <li> Detangles very well, helps define my curls, pricey, but worth it. I love how the Denmans don&#x27;t have the balls on the tips of their brushes.</li>
            <li> If you ever use this brush you will be a fan for life. Used them for forty years</li>
            <li> This brush is Outstanding! It glides through wet, thick, curly hair with relative ease. I have type 4 Black textured hair and my hair poses no problem for this brush. It will be a staple in my drawer. As my hair grows out, I&#x27;ll be purchasing the paddle brush in the Denman line.</li>
            <li> Let me just say...why haven&#x27;t I bought this brush a looong time ago? If you are thinking about purchasing this brush, just stop thinking, place it in your cart and hit &amp;#34;Place Order&amp;#34; because this is an amazing brush! I have natural afro textured hair...around the 4A-B range. This brush it great at detangling, smoothing and makes my curls more pronounced. I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes! Seems like the more I brushed my hair with this brush (with leave in conditioner in it) my curls seemed to become more bouncy. Another great factor is that this brush removes the shed strands without damaging your hair...less fall out..I&#x27;m winning with this brush. It&#x27;s officially my holy grail brush, no more wide toothed shower combs for me. I thought about modifying this brush when I first bought it so that it wouldn&#x27;t be rough on my strands but so far I don&#x27;t feel that I need to. This was money well spent. I do recommend this to any and everybody, especially if you have curly, coarse, thick hair. Please do you and your hair a favor and give this brush a try, you may just fall in love with it like I did.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a quality product. It is made well. I have somewhat thick, coarse, relaxed hair. I never use it on wet hair as the bristles are still. I use it on my dry hair only. I don&#x27;t notice a lot of hair shedding when I use it, but there is usually a little shedding noted when I use it as opposed to my paddle brush (no shedding). I mainly use this brush to tighten my wrap at night.</li>
            <li> Great brush for ultra curly hair. Will buy another and highly recommend for curly hair. The extra space between the bristles is the key. Excellent brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not they dynamo hair-brushing experience that I was expecting after reading so many comments, &amp; with all the YouTube natural hair people.  However, I did like the look &amp; substantial feel of the brush.  I cannot say that I find it to be superior to any other hair brush that I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair before.  My wide tooth comb &amp; fingers do a much better detangling job.</li>
            <li> This brush completely delivers what it promises. It manages to clump my curls and add definition. It is well made and I definitely would purchase again. Simply put, I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! My hair is kinky/tightly coiled and this brush helps me detangle with ease. I highly recommend this denman brush for people with thick curly or kinky hair.</li>
            <li> Updated Review:&lt;br /&gt;My afro-textured hair is exceptionally thick; even when relaxed. I took out alternating rows of bristles so it is now a 4 row brush. This increased its flexibility. Its officially my favorite brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review: 3 Stars&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are well spaced, but very stiff with no bend which is not ideal for relaxed hair.&lt;br /&gt;Will be returning the item.</li>
            <li> Love this brush, a game changer for working with my natural 4c hair.</li>
            <li> Best Denman brush for natural hair. The bristles are thicker and more spaced out, as well as super sturdy so they don&#x27;t snag. I saw this on iknowlee&#x27;s YouTube page and picked it up and it&#x27;s perfectttttt.</li>
            <li> I love it. Love how it clumps my curls ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
            <li> Specifically made for thick or coarse hair and does a great job also easy to clean. Would definitely buy this brush again.</li>
            <li> For my tangled poodle with the difficult hair... she&#x27;s the only one whose hair just tangles all the time, in spite of frequent washings, deep conditionings, heavy conditioners, and leave in products.  And her hair just doesn&#x27;t detangle easily as do all the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of desperation, I ordered this because of all the glowing reviews from people with similar issues.  It works beautifully; and now she enjoys being brushed (no more squiriming and crying from her or me!)  The tangles are successfully removed and her hair looks much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 16 years of struggles with her, we can finally grow her hair to a more flattering length while giving her joy with the brushings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to all who wrote reviews</li>
            <li> OMG!!!! this denman brush is wonderful, it worked wonders on detangling my natural hair. There was no snagging, tugging or pulling of the hair. This is a must have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m LOVING my Denman Styling brush. My hair is thick, kinky and easily tangled. I use my Denman right after washing my hair, while it&#x27;s still wet and it detangles so perfectly in no time at all. Without the little balls on the tips of the plastic &amp;#34;fingers&amp;#34;, it doesn&#x27;t snag my hair at all so I don&#x27;t lose any hair and it makes for a great scalp massage as well.</li>
            <li> DENMAN brushes are by far superior to the Goody brushes i have dangerously raked through my kinky hair. It was so easy to brush the tangles gently from my ends. I highly recomend 4a-c&#x27;s buy this brush!</li>
            <li> All the denman brushes are &amp;#34;good&amp;#34;, this one is as pictured. It&#x27;s a very nice brush for natural hair but as a 4c girl I&#x27;d be happiest if the teeth where even more spaced out.</li>
            <li> So I bought this brush because I thought it was going to be helpful with detangling my hair after a cowash... WRONG! Ladies this clearly isn&#x27;t a detangling brush it is a styling brush, and not for transitioning hair (hair with two textures). I can only use it when my hair is straightened.  It would probably work better if all of my hair was natural as I&#x27;ve seen on youtube videos and reviews, so I will give this 3 stars assuming this is the case.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful brush! Very solid construction and looks nice on my vanity. I have very kinky hair and its also a pretty short afro now. I tried this brush after washing and detangling my hair. I made sure to run the rubber part of the brush against my hair as directed. The curl of my hair appeared no different than when I simply comb it with a wide tooth comb. I am not sure if the short length of my hair (4 - 5 inches straight) makes this brush ineffective, but I suspect it works better on a looser curl pattern (4b or looser). For the price, I will keep the brush and try again once my hair is longer and stretches by its own weight.</li>
            <li> This item is wonderful. It detangles, doesn&#x27;t pull the hair and doesn&#x27;t hurt. It was shipped most expeditiously. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have all natural hair, 4b/4c and this is great for detangling, while wet of course. It defines my curls &amp; makes for an easier blowout!</li>
            <li> strong, and durable. This denham brush does the job for natural 4b hair. it detangles great and defines curls after a wash and go. a must have for all naturalistas out there</li>
            <li> Excellent brush for thick/curly hair. I&#x27;ve been using it for many years. One problem: after about 8-12 months of normal every day use the plastic handle cracks &amp; eventually brakes off. My hair is very thick and very curly. Despite this flaw I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It is worth the price.</li>
            <li> This brush was delivered in a timely manner, and there are no complaints from me. This is not my first Denman brush, but it is certainly the cheapest I have obtained, and I have not seen any difference in build quality. I was able to modify the brush to my liking and put it back together pretty easily.  Kudos to Denman for making a quality product.</li>
            <li> It came to my house fast, but the brush is to hard on my hair. My hair breaks every time I brush it.</li>
            <li> This is the best detangler for my hair lov it!!!</li>
            <li> I really love this denman brush. It works great detangling my type 4 hair. I use it during wash week or when i need my hair straight. The only problem I have is that my hair tends to shed a lot into the bristles but other than that I think its a great product. I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I like this brush. I&#x27;m glad I splurged on it a bit because it allows me to brush my natural hair (when wet) with minimal shedding or breakage. I&#x27;d recommend it!</li>
            <li> Popularity breeds production, and the popularity of the &amp;#34;curly girl&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; hair movements are no different. A new cream, elixir, co-wash, tool comes out every month, all swearing to be the &amp;#34;end-all&amp;#34;, the grail you&#x27;ve all been looking for. I&#x27;m not interested. I just want healthy, well-groomed hair. This brush is not an empty promise. It is a well-made and effective tool - no sparkle, no celebrity endorsement, no website, no high-production videos. Just an excellent tool that does what it says. I&#x27;ve got more to do than style my hair; this brush is a mainstay, a keeper.</li>
            <li> My hair is curly and I was looking for a brush that groomed well and moved through my hair with ease. This brush does just that. Would recommend to anyone with curly or coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I have rather coarse, thick hair, and the fine-toothed combs commonly available just don&#x27;t work as they should for my hair.</li>
            <li> Each and every time we try to use this brush, the red base slides out and the bristles fall out.  Waste of money and frustrating. Detangling fine wavy hair is already challenging enough, without the brush falling apart on you!</li>
            <li> Caused hair breakage.</li>
            <li> Great for my curls!! If you use with a gel or mouse that works with your hair type, your curls will pop for sure! At first I didn&#x27;t think it could work with my kinky hair type but now I love it!</li>
            <li> This brush is well worth the investment. Its helps to define my curls. I also enjoy the fact that cleaning the brush is quite simple. You simply must have one of these in you natural hair collection..</li>
            <li> This brush literally does everything I (and whatever family member &#x27;borrowing&#x27;) need it to do. Detangle. Smooth. Massage scalp. Even my grand-babies love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s indestructible yet, but it&#x27;s rather hardy.</li>
            <li> We used to be able to buy these state side at most professional beauty supply stores - not so much anymore. Glad we can still get them online - Thanks Burmax and Amazon!  The wide bristles are perfect for long scraggly hair. I am able to brush my hair without much loss breakage. I have one in the shower as well - perfect for combing conditioner through wet hair.</li>
            <li> I have very coarse 4a/4b hair. I find that this brush is good for removing any access shed hair or helping to detangle wet hair after i use a wide tooth comb. I mainly use it on the ends after using the wide tooth comb. I would not dare use it from roots to tips. Thus, i have not had any hair breakage while using this brush. It has a pretty good grip and it is easy to clean. This Denman feels like a good quality brush.</li>
            <li> Easy detangling my hair. sometimes I am still gentle because i dont want to break it  because its not like you pay $2 for it</li>
            <li> I luv this brush for detangling! I have curly African American hair.</li>
            <li> So just to be fair and do a hesitant review without hyperbole I want to put some specs out that no one seems to mention:    When did I get this?: I purchased this brush recently during the month of July.  And how many times have you used it?: I have used it twice so far.  My hair type and length: 4C, my kitchen (area from my nape up) is a beast, hair by my forehead and ears is like 4B-4A. My hair barely meets at my shoulders in front but in the back the hair on my nape brushes the top of my back.  Do I have other Denmans?: Yes, I have a really old D3 that doesn&#x27;t even look like they do today and the newer version.  How long have you been natural?: 3-4 years    So I have had this brush for a short while, it&#x27;s still the beautiful red color and has yet to turn adobe. It&#x27;s only been 1.5 months, why would it? I bought this from a beauty store I saw in another town. Previous to that I had no idea it existed and was so popular. What grabbed me was that the brush said it was made for Afro and thick hair  and I qualify in both those categories. I liked the fact the bristles were so spaced. This was a solution to modification on the D4 of Goody copy because since the rubber base was made to support the spaced bristles, the base was strong enough to rake through the hair thoroughly, give the user less work of working the handle, and the rubber base wouldn&#x27;t slip out because of stress against more hair than it was intended for.     The first time I used this, I was of course doing a wet dangle. I had a cheapy tangle teezer I just bought and my D3 to help out too. I was testing the tangle teezer that day too and just in case had my D3 to finish and give a thorough swipe with. Couldn&#x27;t get a fair impression but definitely was taken back by the fact my scalp was getting felt up by this brush. It can actually work it&#x27;s way to your scalp and massage it. That means follicle stimulation and potential hair growth.    The second use came yesterday and this is what inspired me to write areview today:  I was going to be late to an interview. I needed to shower but I needed to detangle my hair too. I had half an hour to get ready and another to get to this interview. I dislike detangling my hair, it takes well into 30 minutes or more to do. I could avoid this if I wore my hair is a style but I sincerely I don&#x27;t know how to braid and twists hurt my hands sometimes. I just wear a wild Afro and sleep on a satin pillowcase, that &#x27;s all I have time for. So I did some twists after the first time I used the brush and wore the twists in a ponytail to stretch my hair, then 2 weeks later unravel them for my friend&#x27;s graduation party. I&#x27;ve gotten in a pool twice within these 2 weeks and my Fro shrinks but also starts feeling dry. Next thing I know, I have this interview. I&#x27;m in the shower, piling on the Aussie moist con and hoping I can rake through my pseudo matted hair in less than 30 minutes. I decide to put my faith alone in the FreeFlow Denman and did not even pick up my D3 first. But I was doubting the FreeFlow and thought I was gonna need to use the D3 to finish the work and give a thorough detangling. I begin to get my ends doubting it would even detangle them but it did easily. I was hearing fewer pops of hairs too versus when I used my D3. My front and ear area are all detangled, now my kitchen needed working front to back and up. It too submitted to this brush but it did so way more easily than the D3. And all the while, my scalp is massaged by the spaced out bristles. The kicker is this all happened between 10-20 minutes of time. My detangling process became shorter, faster, and less stressful. Just to be sure, I&#x27;ll time myself next time. I had to dash for this interview so that was my only time indicator.    Lasting Impression: I believe this should be your first Denman brush and I am surprised that Sallys nor any other retailer with a hair section has not picked up their own stock of these specific brushes. It&#x27;s not just hype and in my opinion isan essential tool for naturals.</li>
            <li> I love this hairbrush.  Works good on wet hair too.</li>
            <li> Great detangler. Love using it. Could not have asked for a better brush. It is great to use with conditioner</li>
            <li> I have just received my very first Denman brush. It&#x27;s awesome! Great for my natural hair. It is well made. This is the BEST brush I have ever purchased. I would recommend others to purshase it. I hope order more. Thanks!</li>
            <li> My hair is most likely 4a that I deliberately underprocess using a relaxer (texlax). Although my hair is technically relaxed, it looks and behaves more like natural hair than relaxed hair, and tangles up pretty badly. I was hesitant to try a Denman brush because relaxed women are notoriously not into Denman brushes, but I finally decided to give it a try realizing that my hair seems to respond better to products and techniques geared towards naturals. Anyway, I love this brush! I specifically choose this one because the bristles are more spaced out, which I take to mean as it is gentler than the standard Denman brush. This brush removes every last shed hair with such ease that it virtually eliminates all my tangles. It&#x27;s surprisingly gentle considering all of the bristles. It even gets through my new growth with such ease. I recommend using this brush on small sections and brushing from the bottom up in slower, deliberate strokes. If you find yourself constantly dealing with tangles, you should definitely give this product a try.</li>
            <li> Order was open and seem use! But after a little cleaning I use it on my sister in turn out to be a ok brush</li>
            <li> Same day I received my brush (7/12/15), I brushed a small section of my hair 4-5 times and to my surprise the handle broke in two!!</li>
            <li> After my big chop I was searching for appropriate styling tools that wouldn&#x27;t damage my hair. This Denman brush is remarkable and  it detangles my kinky, coily, 4b/c hair with no breakage - only the usual shedding.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush last week and I like it. It  massages my scalp which I love. I would recommend this brush if you have a really itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> the best brush for getting out tangles! I love it!</li>
            <li> My daughter has very long, thick, curly hair and it&#x27;s been difficult to deal with. I often had to help. Since I got her this brush, she can handle her hair on her own. It&#x27;s easier to brush out tangles. Nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through so many brushes and this is by far my favorite. It perfectly detangles my daughter&#x27;s extremely thick, curly and long hair (perfect on coarse African American hair) and the pins are spaced perfectly so it doesn&#x27;t pull her hair. I use it on her wet hair to brush it before it dries to help with the detangling process as well as for daily grooming. I&#x27;ve used imitation brushes that have slipped right out of the handle and lost it&#x27;s needles but this brush is durable, sturdy and well-worth the money.</li>
            <li> Great brush. Use it every day. Comfortable to the hands.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush I&#x27;ve ever purchased!  Thanks Denman!</li>
            <li> I love my brushes. I have been using these Denman brushes since I was a little girl. They hold up fantastically.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. Perfect for natural hair</li>
            <li> I love love LOVE this brush I use it on my hair every night, really good for detangling and its easy on my curls. :D</li>
            <li> I love this brush for detangling my natural hair.  I would buy for myself, but I&#x27;m going together one for my granddaughter</li>
            <li> not like other brushes that pulls out hair. Its soft enought to be gentle with natural hair but durable enough to get a good brush through your head of hair and get tangles out</li>
