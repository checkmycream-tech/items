            <li>Item arrived on time and in great condition.  </li>
            <li>The lavender witch hazel is so soothing and feels great on the skin.</li>
            <li>Never have I been so happy with my complexion.</li>
            <li>Great...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful to find something that is so nice for the skin and affordable too.</li>
            <li>Great smell, great for the skin.</li>
            <li>It smells GREAT.</li>
            <li>I used the rose formula and I was impressed</li>
            <li>Great product for my type of skin.</li>
            <li>Smells soapier than I would have thought but like all of Thayer&#x27;s witch hazel products, works great as a toner</li>
            <li>Also great for after shaving legs, but before massaging in lotion.</li>
            <li>I liked the flawless look</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for every skin type.  </li>
            <li>The product has a light, pleasant scent; it goes on velvety-smooth; it works as a toner and a mid-day cleanser; it feels wonderful on my skin and my skin feels wonderful with it on.  </li>
            <li>Love!!</li>
            <li>Love this toner!!  </li>
            <li>plus is the smell which is fantastic!!!</li>
            <li>love all the Thayers Witch Hazels!!</li>
            <li>Its very nice ....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>The best Alcohol Free toner!</li>
            <li>Hey, who has my bottle of Rose petal witch hazel!</li>
            <li>Great and good smell.</li>
            <li>Pleasant fragrance.  </li>
            <li>With a pleasant, but not overpowering lavender scent, I use Thayers every day.  </li>
            <li>It is soothing and healing with a pleasant  fragrance.</li>
            <li>This has none of that strong earthy smell and the lavender scent in this Thayer&#x27;s is simply wonderful.</li>
            <li>It smells good, which is pleasant when changing a poopy diaper.</li>
            <li>It truly works if you combine this with a good pre-shave preparation and post shave regimen.  </li>
            <li>Good combination with the Witch Hazel.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the rose and lavender scents of this aftershave, and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Combine it with an alum block, and if your skin needs it an aftershave balm, for a superior post shave system.</li>
            <li>I loved the smell.</li>
            <li>I have loved it.  </li>
            <li>However, it does not smell good.  </li>
            <li>My husband always prods what product he&#x27;s smelling -- and not in a good way.  </li>
            <li>Ii wonder if it would be good for babies</li>
            <li>It Is just a darn good product</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>If your skin can tolerate lavender and have oily skin, this is a good choice.  </li>
            <li>Smells good me and my fiance</li>
            <li>It smells so good and cools the skin.</li>
            <li>This one is the best for me and it is cheap.</li>
            <li>This product is a good toner with a fair price.</li>
            <li>Everything is good since it does what a toner needs to be.</li>
            <li>But, I still decided to keep it since itself is working good on my face and body~</li>
            <li>The rose one is great as well.</li>
            <li>A bit pricey but nice lotion - great aftershave.  </li>
            <li>It would probably be good to use the night before getting close-up photos taken.</li>
            <li>Its good.</li>
            <li>Alcohol free toner is the best.</li>
            <li>The added Vitamin E &amp; Aloe Vera are an added bonus, plus it&#x27;s good for your skin &amp; will not sting or irritate.</li>
            <li>The scents are very beautiful and clean, nothing artificial-smelling.  </li>
            <li>The lavender fragrance is light and very pleasant.</li>
            <li>I Love Love Love This Product!!!!!</li>
            <li>Love Thayers products; have used most of the scents and this one and the rose is the best.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure this stuff is great if you are a witch hazel fan, I just don&#x27;t perceive the benefits for myself.</li>
            <li>great toner &amp; face refresher :)</li>
            <li>Have used it all week and it feels very nice on the skin, cleanses well, and is refreshing.</li>
            <li>I am sure it will fit perfectly to my needs.</li>
            <li>Love this toner!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite toner now!</li>
            <li>Love all of these toners!</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>It has a refreshing scent to it!</li>
            <li>This toner has worked phenomenally!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite witch hazel!</li>
            <li>This alcohol-free witch hazel has a lovely fragrance and does the job!</li>
            <li>Love this toner!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Love the product and the smell!</li>
            <li>I really love this product!</li>
            <li>but my family has discovered it and they love it too!</li>
            <li>As an avid follower of beauty and makeup trends, I always spend money on the best designer products and name brands from Sephora.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love the lavender!</li>
            <li>Refreshing!</li>
            <li>And my skin has been more &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; than ever!</li>
            <li>I love this Lavender Smell!</li>
            <li>I seriously love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this toner!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>And it smells lovely!</li>
            <li>I was happy to find an alcohol free version of the witch hazel</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>I like this toner as I have also tried the Rose scent.</li>
            <li>Gosh, I hope Thayer doesn&#x27;t realize how good it is and increase the price :-)</li>
            <li>It smells so nice</li>
            <li>Also acts as a nice splash after shaving to tighten pores and prepare for post shave lotion.</li>
            <li>Perfect for skin upkeep, nice and gentle but helps prevent razor burn and irritation bumps</li>
            <li>It smells so much better and works just as good as a toner.</li>
            <li>Nice toner for my oily skin will purchase this again.  </li>
            <li>Nice to find this lavender witch hazel.</li>
            <li>I will not get this scent again; I prefer the rose scent to this one.</li>
            <li>Nice product that removes any traces of makeup after cleansing.</li>
            <li>Nice scent.</li>
            <li>I have loved Thayer Witch Hazel for years and now love the lavender fragrance......</li>
            <li>The aloe is a nice touch.  </li>
            <li>The scent is nice and clean/soothing.</li>
            <li>Rose, Cucumber, Lemon, Peach, etc.  </li>
            <li>This scent or rose works well.</li>
            <li>for a gentler formula, try rose petal.&lt;br /&gt;delivered</li>
            <li>Nice relaxing smell.</li>
            <li>buy nice products for shaving:</li>
            <li>but it feels nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the rose version of this toner on and off for years.</li>
            <li>However, although the rose scent is good, it&#x27;s a bit overwhelmingly floral and poofy.</li>
            <li>It smells kind of like baby shampoo, if I had to place it -</li>
            <li>I prefer the Lavender to their Rose one, it&#x27;s all a matter of preference.</li>
            <li>I have combination to oily skin, and the rose one is soothing and balancing.</li>
            <li>The scent is very nice and light - not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin as smells very nice.</li>
            <li>It smells great and my skin feels clean after using it.  </li>
            <li>Lavender scent is very mild and pleasant.</li>
            <li>It is a very nice, clean scent and works just as well as the Rose version.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the ROSE version for years, it is a nice refreshing toner.  </li>
            <li>good product, just as described, came to me very quickly.</li>
            <li>Happy with the product and quick shipment from the seller.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive and this witch hazel toner is wonderful.</li>
            <li>A very nice, mild toner -- I use this after I&#x27;ve cleansed my face with a Konjac sponge.</li>
            <li>Excellent natural toner.</li>
            <li>I like the rose too, but my face seems to like the lavender one better.</li>
            <li>love, love, love this witch hazel, lavender scent is gorgeous.</li>
            <li>Good,but the rose is my favorite.</li>
            <li>It smells pleasant and makes you feel clean.</li>
            <li>Nice and refreshing to use.</li>
            <li>I like the way it makes my face feel, although the rose is better in this regard.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s important to have a good product like this as a toner.</li>
            <li>With sensitive skin, this product responds perfectly!</li>
            <li>and I love the rose scent.  </li>
            <li>The product has a wonderful light fragrance and is gently yet effective.  </li>
            <li>She still has monthly breakouts, but most of the time it looks great, and her breakout scars heal quickly.      </li>
            <li>Slapped some of this on after a nice straight razor shave and voilà!!!!  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and good packaging!</li>
            <li>Thayers is a good brand, love that it&#x27;s alcohol free</li>
            <li>Does not contain alcohol which is very important when it comes to toners.  </li>
            <li>its a great toner, smells nice and leaves your skin feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>The bottle is huge!  </li>
            <li>greatest facial product ever !!!  </li>
            <li>Totally satisfied.</li>
            <li>Much better for my skin than the witch hazel that contains alcohol.</li>
            <li>I have read some reviews from folks that don&#x27;t like a product that has any scent, but dont let that keep you from getting this - the scent is lovely while applying, but will not linger on.  </li>
            <li>after I wash my face and love how it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>love the smell.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I recently started shaving with a DE razor, and this stuff is great after shaving and before Aftershave!!!!!    </li>
            <li>You can purchase all of these products here on Amazon as I did with most.  </li>
            <li>I purchased more bottles to give to some friends...who are also seeing benefits.</li>
            <li>Smell and feel are lovely.</li>
            <li>I use this in leu of face wash and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Clinique, SK-II, Lancôme, Estée Lauder, and DHC among many others.  </li>
            <li>Nothing better than this.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love witch hazel and this one has an added benefit of smelling like lavender.</li>
            <li>I love the lavender scent but lavender is one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li>Love Thayer Witch Hazel....</li>
            <li>So glad I decided to try this out</li>
            <li>Much better than soap at cleaning the day&#x27;s grime off.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and tones the skin very well</li>
            <li>spells great and very moisturizing</li>
            <li>I love Thayer&#x27;s alcohol-free toners.</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>I love using it after I wash my face (AM and PM).  </li>
            <li>I really love this Witch Hazel.  </li>
            <li>Will be getting more when this runs out.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I use it asva cleaning as well not just refreshing.</li>
            <li>just refreshing 😊</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Who would have thought that the witch hazel in the stores is mostly alcohol?</li>
            <li>My skin does look more even and pores are not quite as noticeable as before.  </li>
            <li>The left over toner in the bottle is used on my face and works great!</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this toner...</li>
            <li>I use moisturizer afterward, but the thing I love about this version is that there is no drying alcohol.</li>
            <li>and my face looks more clear!&lt;br</li>
            <li>will be buyng more when needed.</li>
            <li>My husband used it after getting razor burn, as well, and it helped with the itchiness without an overwhelming smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried this &amp; will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite toner.</li>
            <li>My skin is noticeably more hydrated.</li>
            <li>I went to a whole foods store and bought the Lavender variety because it smells great, contains Glycerin and Aloe, and also does not have alcohol.&lt;br</li>
            <li>have tried many products, but no after shave can beat this.  </li>
            <li>Fast service - great product ... just as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Lovely product.</li>
            <li>It is ok, acceptable ...</li>
            <li>This toner is so calming and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better, it smells great, it doesn&#x27;t sting my face, and I can use it straight from the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I use the refreshing cucumber in the a.m. and the lavender before bed.  </li>
            <li>Also,  I love this product.</li>
            <li>LOVE the scent.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This toner is PERFECT for that, and I also use it at night after cleansing to take off the last traces of makeup.</li>
            <li>Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel Toner is a miracle worker and it smells lovely.</li>
            <li>It removes makeup residue wonderfully, I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>It is refreshing and it seems to balance my skin&#x27;s combination zones.  </li>
            <li>My skin has never been better.</li>
            <li>friend recommended this product to me and now I am in love.</li>
            <li>I love this toner.</li>
            <li>and I have been using it for many years.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of it.</li>
            <li>I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>and I love the look and feel of my skin.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I am really very exited to use it, yay and happy</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says: cleanse, soften, refreshes and moisturizes — Anyone can use it!!!</li>
            <li>I originally bought Dickinsons, and found it to be amazing-</li>
            <li>But so far so good!</li>
            <li>and I love the fresh smell of Lavender!!  </li>
            <li>Nice, clean scent.  </li>
            <li>and my skin feels nice and clean afterward.</li>
            <li>The smell is ok, not my favorite, I have another scent by this brand that I enjoy much more.</li>
            <li>This is quickly becoming a favorite in my household.  </li>
            <li>This is the best toner I&#x27;ve ever used, and plan to continue using it for as long as I can.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice product, I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It is soothing, not drying, and smells great yet natural and not too perfumey!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle yet effective. :)</li>
            <li>So far great product</li>
            <li>I used this toner after I heard it&#x27;s a great natural alternative to aftershave and acne toner.</li>
            <li>I love that this is already a toner and alcohol free.</li>
            <li>I typically love the smell of lavender, but this has more of a perfumey floral scent than a true lavender smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is light, but refreshing.</li>
            <li>What I love also is how it doesn&#x27;t sting my skin when I&#x27;m applying it with a cotton pad because it&#x27;s alcohol free.</li>
            <li>I enjoy shaving, and consider it more of a hobby than a chore, and 2.)</li>
            <li>Very refreshing on a hot day.</li>
            <li>I love that this is alcohol free because it saves my skin.  </li>
            <li>My face is much more smooth and just happier.</li>
            <li>I like the light scent of this variety better.</li>
            <li>I love the cucumber scent, original, lavender and pretty much most of the scents except for the rose scent which I don&#x27;t think I will enjoy.</li>
            <li>Love the fresh lavender scent!</li>
            <li>it might be a bit strong for others liking.</li>
            <li>Not too strong and not too feminine.</li>
            <li>Classic witch hazel good for applying to pimples etc.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so smooth and clean!</li>
            <li>I use it in the morning before serums and moisturizer; at night I use it as a quick cleanser after makeup removal, with a bit of rose hip seed oil and sweet almond oil for night-time care and repair.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice light scent and leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s relatively cheap and easy to find.</li>
            <li>I use this if something starts bleeding, and the bleeding quickly stops!</li>
            <li>and when I do they heal quick!</li>
            <li>It has quickly become my favorite part of my skincare routine.</li>
            <li>Will also use on skin after shaving, it rids razor bumps quickly!</li>
            <li>I took the advice of another reviewer and also used the toner to clean my makeup brushes - and my brushes are as good as new!  </li>
            <li>gentle, alcohol free, the aloe vera is a nice addition as is the Vitamin E.</li>
            <li>I was a huge skeptic of Witch Hazel and even barrated people who recommended it.</li>
            <li>The lavender scent is light and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>So when I switched to DE shaving, I ordered this alcohol free witch hazel toner which was recommended on one of Mantic59&#x27;s YouTube videos.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been waiting for a shave this smooth for years as I am now in my 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s important to heal your face correctly after you shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Thayer for last 2.5 yrs and am happy with the result.  </li>
            <li>Like that it is alcohol free.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic too</li>
            <li>Makes a great facial toner at a fraction of the price of name brand ones.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy having a smooth head, and preferably one with without any irritation.  </li>
            <li>it helped cleared up my bumps nicely, though the alcohol agitated my bumps to an extent, not allowing them to heal as fast as they should.  </li>
            <li>Using witch hazel after a shave is an important part of my shaving routine.</li>
            <li>did some research and found Thayer&#x27;s alcohol free witch hazel products.  </li>
            <li>It also does a great job of removing any extra dirt or oil that you may have on your face after washing.</li>
            <li>, I started using Badger Damascus Rose beauty balm with it and that combo has really healed my combo/acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>light fragrance that doesn&#x27;t linger&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>OK....witch hazel is a simple, ages-old product that does a great job, all by itself.........</li>
            <li>B0084TIFAQ The Homestead Company Alcohol Free Witch</li>
            <li>light fragrance that doesn&#x27;t linger&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>The product came on time and was precisely what I ordered.  </li>
            <li>Love this toner, leaves skin smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li>potential First-timers, Thayers Witch-Hazel, is an all-around great product to have around the house!</li>
            <li>I bought this because I have been using witch hazel for about a year now and the smell of just plain witch hazel is not so great!</li>
            <li>me tell you, THIS PRODUCT ABSOLUTELY WORKS!!!  </li>
            <li>My super-sensitive skin feels better immediately, and retains the calm clean feeling well into the day.</li>
            <li>I will purchase the rose (which does smell true to rose) next time.</li>
            <li>the price is fair for such a great product and one that is such a huge part of my &amp;#34;beauty routine.&amp;#34; i plan to continue purchasing as needed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the rose toner for much longer time, and after trying this one out, I decided to go back to the rose one because it suits my skin better.</li>
            <li>but it smells amazing and isn&#x27;t too strong for my overly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>Love these toners, I&#x27;m on my third bottle and my skin has never been better!</li>
            <li>After trying to use more natural products on my face, I was in search for a great toner for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It leave me feeling clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>I always follow it up with these toners after I puck my eye brows, trim any hair off of my face/neck/nose or clean my pores with the instruments that assists in removing blackheads, etc.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s gentle and free of anything harmful :)</li>
            <li>Scent is light and clean and fades quickly.</li>
            <li>They pick up and clean my pores so well.</li>
            <li>The toner shrinks your pores so after washing and exfoliating, close them up while they&#x27;re still clean with this toner.</li>
            <li>I subsequently purchased the Thayers rose scented version and that scent is much better.  </li>
            <li>I see a distinct reduction in redness, inflammation, dryness, irritation and fine lines within one day of use.</li>
            <li>I was looking for an astringent without alcohol, and was a little concerned about the fragrance, but it is very light and pleasant.</li>
            <li>:B002QG3QBQ Taylor of Old Bond Street Rose Shaving Cream]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Ive rebought this at whole foods many times after.</li>
            <li>It was a good price, the purchase was sealed and arrived quickly enough.</li>
            <li>I use a good cleanser and a Clarisonic, and the toner always lifts off the last particles of city pollution and dirt from my face, neck, and decolleté.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s surprisingly moisturizing, so I use it as such.</li>
            <li>I really like the product, but don&#x27;t love the scent.</li>
            <li>I also love that It&#x27;s gentle and non-drying.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>While you can feel that somethings on your face, it&#x27;s not a bad sticky or yucky feel to it.  </li>
            <li>This is a really good compromise for price and it does have cleansing as well as a moisturizing effect so you can use this if you&#x27;re in a big rush and don&#x27;t have time for a full routine.</li>
            <li>I then use my moisturizer on top and so far it seems like everything is fine.  </li>
            <li>My favorite new toiletry find!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s alright, doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling as fresh and clean as alcohol-based toners</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly &amp; packaged well.</li>
            <li>Received the product quickly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s helped tremendously.  </li>
            <li>Everything that I wanted - quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more when I run out. :)</li>
            <li>Shopping was quick, but when I received my package, it was leaking out the package.</li>
            <li>I love lavender, and use the essential oil and lavender scents for many things.</li>
            <li>And to top it off it leaves my face feeling soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice enough in that it is alcohol free witch hazel.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t contain any alcohol, smells great, really clears out extra gunk from your skin, and softens it as well.</li>
            <li>shipped quickly; helping to reduce redness on my face without drying</li>
            <li>I use it regularly and very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I use Thayers after removing my make-up and washing my face to make sure my face is clean and my pores are clear.</li>
            <li>only a week my skin is smoother and more supple, as well as more clear and even has more of a glow to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>only a week my skin is smoother and more supple, as well as more clear and even has more of a glow to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have spent THOUSANDS of dollars on finding the perfect shave, as I enjoy being clean shaven every single day.  </li>
            <li>It came very quick and was packaged very well.</li>
            <li>Very gentle on my skin but still leaves a clean feeling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing like the clinique one that burns a little - this is very soothing and smells incredible.</li>
            <li>Trust me when I say that it helps calm the skin.</li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s alcohol free and the lavender is really soothing.</li>
            <li>I have been using Thayer&#x27;s Rose Witch Hazel for several years now.  </li>
            <li>I love that this product is natural and does just what it says.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took a while to find a replacement, but Thayer&#x27;s is worth the effort.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no drying effects, but it cleanses just as powerfully as stronger toners I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>think I may try their rose scent next!</li>
            <li>Fresh.</li>
            <li>and i don&#x27;t feel fresh after using it.</li>
            <li>By far, Thayer&#x27;s Lavender is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Most others irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually surprised that I don&#x27;t see more reviews on the scent of the lavender version.</li>
            <li>This stuff works good and really calms red irritated skin.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this witch hazel, and so far it isn&#x27;t making my face break out, like witch hazel with alcohol does.</li>
            <li>It was delivered very quickly and nicely packed although the lid on one bottle was slightly damaged.</li>
            <li>For my needs, they&#x27;re just right.</li>
            <li>Received right away and just what I needed</li>
            <li>Use as a toner after a shower &amp; as a quick facial cleanse before bed, love the scent..</li>
            <li>But it certainly isn&#x27;t hurting it!</li>
            <li>The toner however, is effective; it calms my sensitive skin and locks in moisture leaving my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product numerous times and it is a nice, gentle toner.  </li>
            <li>It has a soft lavender scent, not too strong.</li>

            <li>Very gentle on the skin</li>
            <li>This is such a refreshing toner.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>If you are interested in switching over to the smartest (and cheapest) way to shave in luxury, I recommend watching Mantic59 videos and joining the [...]</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried the Lavender</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s what I was getting , an alcohol free toner with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Will buy more in the future!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, would buy from again!</li>
            <li>I got exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>have the entire family using this product and we all love it.</li>
            <li>Most importantly no traditional witch hazel scent.</li>
            <li>Really like this item!</li>
            <li>I use it for so many different things.</li>
            <li>This is such a refreshing way to perk up your skin throughout the day or remove make-up.</li>
            <li>This was my first time to use witch hazel</li>
            <li>Works very well!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite Thayer&#x27;s product and I will be keeping this in my routine for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li>I use it to cleanse my face first thing in the morning, before moisturizing.</li>
            <li>If you need your pores to look better for something the next day, I&#x27;d use it the night before, though.</li>
            <li>I really like this toner!</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>At first, all I could find was the Witch Hazel w/alcohol ...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give that tingly sensation so many people like, but I can say that this stuff actually works.</li>
            <li>and I really like it!</li>
            <li>Good product, I use it to keep face moistured everyday and it worked out well.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it contains no alcohol, but still makes my skin smooth and tight.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that I switched from a toner that also had rose in it as well as lavender that I loved so much, but was too costly.</li>
            <li>It works well, smells good, seems to help prevent razor burn and sooth the slightly raw skin I get from shaving.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s my daily shaving set up: Astra Superior Platinum DE blades, an adjustable Merkur Progress safety razor, PlantLife organic coconut and vanilla facial soap, Art of Shaving Lavender shaving cream, and Art of Shaving Lavender aftershave.  </li>
            <li>The rose variety has fake rose scent too....</li>
            <li>Nothing wrong with this product, and I know it is loved by many.</li>
            <li>and it leaves such a relieving clean feeling!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad that I chose an alcohol-free version because it doesn&#x27;t irritate or overly dry my skin.</li>
            <li>The lavender scent is very mild and only noticeable when applying, and doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li>I typically use rose water for an all-natural toner, but when I came across this lavender witch hazel toner I had to try it.</li>
            <li>I love this because it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>Very soothing and can be used as a fast take off of makeup when I don&#x27;t have much time!</li>
            <li>and you get a large bottle</li>
            <li>The smell of the lavender fragrance used in this smells similar to cheap lavender soap and it is very vile.  </li>
            <li>gentle on skin.</li>
            <li>She began to use the lavendar witch hazel morning and night and her skin is much clearer now.</li>
            <li>I really like this toner.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and shave like a real man.  </li>
            <li>It leaves the skin ready for moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I also tried it on my face and it works really well as a toner.</li>
            <li>But with the Thayer&#x27;s toner, my skin has improved so much.</li>
            <li>I will go back to using Neutrogena&#x27;s alcohol free toner.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It really soothes the skin and moisturizes the skin.  </li>
            <li>So at times, I use it when my oily skin becomes too much to handle.  </li>
            <li>Oh boy I am very impressed!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Very soothing and calming.</li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>this is the 3rd time i have ordered from this seller and everything comes packaged and sealed securely.</li>
            <li>I have acne prone skin and this toner does not seem to help much.</li>
            <li>you are looking for a REAL lavender smell, try [ASIN:</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to using this stuff.</li>
            <li>Gentle on the skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a natural, fresh product</li>
            <li>It came fast.</li>
            <li>, you name it - after my evening showers (when my pores are open) and it&#x27;s been fantastic.</li>
            <li>I cleanse afterwards with my gently cleanser and then moisturize.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great;it&#x27;s gentle</li>
            <li>My 15yr old daughter had teen acne, and we tried many products with dissapointment.  </li>
            <li>I have only ever purchased the Lavender and Rose ones, but I&#x27;m definitely going to start purchasing some of the others.</li>
            <li>, To get the benefits of rose I was missing out on with this toner</li>
            <li>Great product, gentle on skin, subtle, natural fragrance - and no alcohol.</li>
            <li>I also detest that the bottle is not travel friendly once you open the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>extra ingredients helps the skin heal nicely, and doesn&#x27;t dry out, causing the bumps to fade away a lot faster.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t entirely tell whether it doses anything for normal skin, but it you&#x27;ve just shaved it&#x27;s great for making small mistakes heal faster.</li>
            <li>saw a video online that recommended keeping this in the refrigerator for an extra cool sensation.  </li>
            <li>I still have an almost full bottle, and I will use it up, so if my opinion changes, I&#x27;ll edit this in the future.</li>
            <li>Usually, I go towards the rose scent, but this time I opted for the lavender.</li>
            <li>I think this toner is my new obsession!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without my Thayer&#x27;s witch hazel!  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s hard to say that there&#x27;s much difference between the scents that I&#x27;ve tried (rose and lavender).</li>
            <li>It smells more like baby wipes and less like lavender.</li>
            <li>neither have alcohol (most witch hazel toners have hidden alcohol).</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend seller.</li>
            <li>i like the kinda old school packaging and like to keep it on my vanity, but it feels great straight from the fridge nice and cold on insect bites or sunburn!!</li>
            <li>It has made this 82 year old skin look much softer.</li>
            <li>Soothing my sensitive skin and very hydrating.</li>
            <li>but good for usual daily use.</li>
            <li>I tried using it a few times more hoping the fragrance would \\&quot;grow\\&quot; on me, but that didn&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li>I have normal skin ..</li>
            <li>It is more expensive since it&#x27;s smaller, but I liked it a lot.</li>
            <li>alas, this lavender doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the peach scent</li>
            <li>and I had to stop using any kind of cleanser earlier this year and just start toners instead to wipe down in the morning and evening,</li>
            <li>I use it every single day as a refreshing facial toner.  </li>
            <li>I like this better than plain Witch Hazel.</li>
            <li>Absolutely can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I almost gave a bottle to a new mom friend of mine</li>
            <li>i refuse to live without it.</li>
            <li>My bottle came in its standard packaging (a generic ziplock bag fit for its size).</li>
            <li>i have only used the lavender and it&#x27;s very gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>I am all for natural &amp; organic &amp; this product fits the bill!  </li>
            <li>worth the money and will continue to buy for a long time to come!</li>
            <li>worth the money and will continue to buy for a long time to come!</li>
            <li>I am African American and have suffered with razor bumps ever since I started full time shaving at the age of 18.  </li>
            <li>Although I am a repeat buyer this is the FIRST time this has happened and only so far.</li>
            <li>Also, it hasn&#x27;t done anything to help clear up my skin or heal the acne I do have.  </li>
            <li>, it keeps your skin clear and protected from dirt</li>
            <li>It helps keep the skin soft and if you have any nicks or cuts it helps them.</li>

            <li>why bother making an all natural toner and then add synthetic fragrance ???</li>
            <li>It has helped with several skin irritants and is very soothing.</li>
            <li>My dog completely stops itching when I put this on her.</li>
            <li>The scent is soft and it does the trick.</li>
            <li>well with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>skin is sensitive and combination but this product doesn&#x27;t irritate my face at all.&lt;br</li>

            <li>Leaves my skin feeling soft and refreshed -</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this toner is so soothing and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>Works very well to balance the skin and remove make up residue left by cleansers.</li>
            <li>natural</li>
            <li>But I would never be able to tell that this is supposed to be lavender in the least.</li>
            <li>natural</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft to the touch, it also removes bllemishes from my skin, leaving an even tone.</li>
            <li>and i have sensitive, finicky skin.</li>
            <li>The scent is not heavy or overpowering.</li>
            <li>My toner was broken from the top lid and there was a whole in the seal.</li>
            <li>Slightly more expensive, it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Good toner doesn&#x27;t have to be expensive.</li>
            <li>I personally, do notice and feel the subtle yet appreciative changes Thayers Witch Hazel does for my face in the morning before make-up and afterwards before I sleep.</li>
            <li>The lavender fragrance is a little intense at first, medicinal-like.  </li>
            <li>Not sure why other people love it s much</li>
            <li>highly recommend getting a spray bottle and using this as a facial moisturizer after the shower.</li>
            <li>But is it different than the Rose-Thayers Witch Hazel (non-alcoholic) I normally get?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a large bottle that will laster a decade longer than the more expensive Art of Shaving products.</li>
            <li>, it is so clear and also not dry anymore.</li>
            <li>Thayer&#x27;s formulas are gentle and non-toxic, and they don&#x27;t dry out the skin.</li>
            <li>It thoroughly cleans any residue left from washing and leaves a blank canvas ready to absorb my serum and moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Definitely part is staying part of daily routine until there can be no more. :)&lt;</li>
            <li>and I have noticed major improvement in pore size.  </li>
            <li>a little burning if you apply it after you deep clean your face</li>
            <li>Smell of toner is not strong and disappears really quickly.</li>
            <li>The all natural ingredients also help act as an antiseptic in addition to adding back some moisture to your face.  </li>

            <li>fast, carefully packed.</li>
            <li>I worked at Teen Vogue and learned about Witch Hazel&#x27;s natural anti-inflammatory properties, so decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li>Personally I use it directly after shaving (face and head), and then I follow it up with some aftershave.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m contemplating installing a small college dorm fridge just to keep this cool.  </li>
            <li>Works ok but not worth the money...found a clone at my local supermarket for half the price</li>
            <li>I also can&#x27;t live without it after giving birth to soothe the perineum, or for after sun/sunburn care, or use on minor scrapes, burns or rashes.</li>
            <li>Product was fine but came with lid half off leaking all over other items purchased.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t loaded up with anything artificial and has a very light lavender scent, but not so much that it can&#x27;t be used by men as an aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Before shaving the old fashioned way, which was really tried and true, I regretfully shaved with expensive multi-blade razor cartridges.  </li>
            <li>Does not dry out my skin in anyway</li>
            <li>Does not dry out skin.</li>
            <li>I have acne rosacea and my skin is extremely sensitive - this product calms my red irritated skin has a lovely (but faint) lavender scent.  </li>
            <li>I am pretty disciplined with my skin- regimen and use it twice a day everyday in combination with balm balm&#x27;s coconut cleanser and moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It has really toned down the oiliness and helps my makeup stay on my face a lot longer.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry skin or agitate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>So far no new breakouts have appeared and it keeps my skin moisturized</li>

            <li> It works great after a shave to tone the skin.</li>

            <li> Item arrived on time and in great condition.  </li>

            <li> Great...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful to find something that is so nice for the skin and affordable too.</li>
            <li> Great smell, great for the skin.</li>
            <li> It smells GREAT.</li>
            <li> I used the rose formula and I was impressed</li>
            <li> Great product for my type of skin.</li>
            <li> Smells soapier than I would have thought but like all of Thayer&#x27;s witch hazel products, works great as a toner</li>
            <li> Also great for after shaving legs, but before massaging in lotion.</li>
            <li> I liked the flawless look</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for every skin type.  </li>

            <li> Love this toner!!  </li>
            <li> plus is the smell which is fantastic!!!</li>
            <li> love all the Thayers Witch Hazels!!</li>
            <li> Its very nice ....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> The best Alcohol Free toner!</li>
            <li> Hey, who has my bottle of Rose petal witch hazel!</li>
            <li> Great and good smell.</li>
            <li> Pleasant fragrance.  </li>
            <li> With a pleasant, but not overpowering lavender scent, I use Thayers every day.  </li>
            <li> It is soothing and healing with a pleasant  fragrance.</li>
            <li> This has none of that strong earthy smell and the lavender scent in this Thayer&#x27;s is simply wonderful.</li>
            <li> It smells good, which is pleasant when changing a poopy diaper.</li>
            <li> It truly works if you combine this with a good pre-shave preparation and post shave regimen.  </li>
            <li> Good combination with the Witch Hazel.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the rose and lavender scents of this aftershave, and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Combine it with an alum block, and if your skin needs it an aftershave balm, for a superior post shave system.</li>
            <li> I loved the smell.</li>
            <li> I have loved it.  </li>
            <li> However, it does not smell good.  </li>
            <li> My husband always prods what product he&#x27;s smelling -- and not in a good way.  </li>
            <li> Ii wonder if it would be good for babies</li>
            <li> It Is just a darn good product</li>
            <li> Good</li>
            <li> If your skin can tolerate lavender and have oily skin, this is a good choice.  </li>
            <li> Smells good me and my fiance</li>
            <li> It smells so good and cools the skin.</li>
            <li> This one is the best for me and it is cheap.</li>
            <li> This product is a good toner with a fair price.</li>
            <li> Everything is good since it does what a toner needs to be.</li>
            <li> But, I still decided to keep it since itself is working good on my face and body~</li>
            <li> The rose one is great as well.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey but nice lotion - great aftershave.  </li>
            <li> It would probably be good to use the night before getting close-up photos taken.</li>
            <li> Its good.</li>
            <li> Alcohol free toner is the best.</li>
            <li> The added Vitamin E &amp; Aloe Vera are an added bonus, plus it&#x27;s good for your skin &amp; will not sting or irritate.</li>
            <li> The scents are very beautiful and clean, nothing artificial-smelling.  </li>
            <li> The lavender fragrance is light and very pleasant.</li>
            <li> I Love Love Love This Product!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love Thayers products; have used most of the scents and this one and the rose is the best.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure this stuff is great if you are a witch hazel fan, I just don&#x27;t perceive the benefits for myself.</li>
            <li> great toner &amp; face refresher :)</li>
            <li> Have used it all week and it feels very nice on the skin, cleanses well, and is refreshing.</li>
            <li> I am sure it will fit perfectly to my needs.</li>
            <li> Love this toner!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite toner now!</li>
            <li> Love all of these toners!</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> It has a refreshing scent to it!</li>
            <li> This toner has worked phenomenally!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite witch hazel!</li>
            <li> This alcohol-free witch hazel has a lovely fragrance and does the job!</li>
            <li> Love this toner!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Love the product and the smell!</li>
            <li> I really love this product!</li>
            <li> but my family has discovered it and they love it too!</li>
            <li> As an avid follower of beauty and makeup trends, I always spend money on the best designer products and name brands from Sephora.</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love the lavender!</li>
            <li> Refreshing!</li>
            <li> And my skin has been more &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; than ever!</li>
            <li> I love this Lavender Smell!</li>
            <li> I seriously love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toner!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> And it smells lovely!</li>
            <li> I was happy to find an alcohol free version of the witch hazel</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> I like this toner as I have also tried the Rose scent.</li>
            <li> Gosh, I hope Thayer doesn&#x27;t realize how good it is and increase the price :-)</li>
            <li> It smells so nice</li>
            <li> Also acts as a nice splash after shaving to tighten pores and prepare for post shave lotion.</li>
            <li> Perfect for skin upkeep, nice and gentle but helps prevent razor burn and irritation bumps</li>
            <li> It smells so much better and works just as good as a toner.</li>
            <li> Nice toner for my oily skin will purchase this again.  </li>
            <li> Nice to find this lavender witch hazel.</li>
            <li> I will not get this scent again; I prefer the rose scent to this one.</li>
            <li> Nice product that removes any traces of makeup after cleansing.</li>
            <li> Nice scent.</li>
            <li> I have loved Thayer Witch Hazel for years and now love the lavender fragrance......</li>
            <li> The aloe is a nice touch.  </li>
            <li> The scent is nice and clean/soothing.</li>
            <li> Rose, Cucumber, Lemon, Peach, etc.  </li>
            <li> This scent or rose works well.</li>
            <li> for a gentler formula, try rose petal.&lt;br /&gt;delivered</li>
            <li> Nice relaxing smell.</li>
            <li> buy nice products for shaving:</li>
            <li> but it feels nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the rose version of this toner on and off for years.</li>
            <li> However, although the rose scent is good, it&#x27;s a bit overwhelmingly floral and poofy.</li>
            <li> It smells kind of like baby shampoo, if I had to place it -</li>
            <li> I prefer the Lavender to their Rose one, it&#x27;s all a matter of preference.</li>
            <li> I have combination to oily skin, and the rose one is soothing and balancing.</li>

            <li> Lavender scent is very mild and pleasant.</li>
            <li> It is a very nice, clean scent and works just as well as the Rose version.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the ROSE version for years, it is a nice refreshing toner.  </li>
            <li> good product, just as described, came to me very quickly.</li>
            <li> Happy with the product and quick shipment from the seller.</li>

            <li> A very nice, mild toner -- I use this after I&#x27;ve cleansed my face with a Konjac sponge.</li>
            <li> Excellent natural toner.</li>
            <li> I like the rose too, but my face seems to like the lavender one better.</li>
            <li> love, love, love this witch hazel, lavender scent is gorgeous.</li>
            <li> Good,but the rose is my favorite.</li>
            <li> It smells pleasant and makes you feel clean.</li>
            <li> Nice and refreshing to use.</li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my face feel, although the rose is better in this regard.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s important to have a good product like this as a toner.</li>
            <li> With sensitive skin, this product responds perfectly!</li>
            <li> and I love the rose scent.  </li>
            <li> The product has a wonderful light fragrance and is gently yet effective.  </li>
            <li> She still has monthly breakouts, but most of the time it looks great, and her breakout scars heal quickly.      </li>
            <li> Slapped some of this on after a nice straight razor shave and voilà!!!!  </li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and good packaging!</li>
            <li> Thayers is a good brand, love that it&#x27;s alcohol free</li>
            <li> Does not contain alcohol which is very important when it comes to toners.  </li>
            <li> its a great toner, smells nice and leaves your skin feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> The bottle is huge!  </li>
            <li> greatest facial product ever !!!  </li>
            <li> Totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> Much better for my skin than the witch hazel that contains alcohol.</li>
            <li> I have read some reviews from folks that don&#x27;t like a product that has any scent, but dont let that keep you from getting this - the scent is lovely while applying, but will not linger on.  </li>
            <li> after I wash my face and love how it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li> love the smell.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I recently started shaving with a DE razor, and this stuff is great after shaving and before Aftershave!!!!!    </li>
            <li> You can purchase all of these products here on Amazon as I did with most.  </li>
            <li> I purchased more bottles to give to some friends...who are also seeing benefits.</li>
            <li> Smell and feel are lovely.</li>
            <li> I use this in leu of face wash and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Clinique, SK-II, Lancôme, Estée Lauder, and DHC among many others.  </li>
            <li> Nothing better than this.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love witch hazel and this one has an added benefit of smelling like lavender.</li>
            <li> I love the lavender scent but lavender is one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> Love Thayer Witch Hazel....</li>
            <li> So glad I decided to try this out</li>

            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Who would have thought that the witch hazel in the stores is mostly alcohol?</li>
            <li> My skin does look more even and pores are not quite as noticeable as before.  </li>
            <li> The left over toner in the bottle is used on my face and works great!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this toner...</li>
            <li> I use moisturizer afterward, but the thing I love about this version is that there is no drying alcohol.</li>
            <li> and my face looks more clear!&lt;br</li>
            <li> will be buyng more when needed.</li>
            <li> My husband used it after getting razor burn, as well, and it helped with the itchiness without an overwhelming smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I tried this &amp; will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite toner.</li>
            <li> My skin is noticeably more hydrated.</li>
            <li> I went to a whole foods store and bought the Lavender variety because it smells great, contains Glycerin and Aloe, and also does not have alcohol.&lt;br</li>
            <li> have tried many products, but no after shave can beat this.  </li>
            <li> Fast service - great product ... just as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Lovely product.</li>
            <li> It is ok, acceptable ...</li>
            <li> This toner is so calming and refreshing.  </li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better, it smells great, it doesn&#x27;t sting my face, and I can use it straight from the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I use the refreshing cucumber in the a.m. and the lavender before bed.  </li>
            <li> Also,  I love this product.</li>
            <li> LOVE the scent.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> This toner is PERFECT for that, and I also use it at night after cleansing to take off the last traces of makeup.</li>
            <li> Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel Toner is a miracle worker and it smells lovely.</li>
            <li> It removes makeup residue wonderfully, I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is refreshing and it seems to balance my skin&#x27;s combination zones.  </li>
            <li> My skin has never been better.</li>
            <li> friend recommended this product to me and now I am in love.</li>
            <li> I love this toner.</li>
            <li> and I have been using it for many years.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of it.</li>
            <li> I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> and I love the look and feel of my skin.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I am really very exited to use it, yay and happy</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says: cleanse, soften, refreshes and moisturizes — Anyone can use it!!!</li>
            <li> I originally bought Dickinsons, and found it to be amazing-</li>
            <li> But so far so good!</li>
            <li> and I love the fresh smell of Lavender!!  </li>
            <li> Nice, clean scent.  </li>
            <li> and my skin feels nice and clean afterward.</li>
            <li> The smell is ok, not my favorite, I have another scent by this brand that I enjoy much more.</li>
            <li> This is quickly becoming a favorite in my household.  </li>
            <li> This is the best toner I&#x27;ve ever used, and plan to continue using it for as long as I can.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product, I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It is soothing, not drying, and smells great yet natural and not too perfumey!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle yet effective. :)</li>
            <li> So far great product</li>
            <li> I used this toner after I heard it&#x27;s a great natural alternative to aftershave and acne toner.</li>
            <li> I love that this is already a toner and alcohol free.</li>
            <li> I typically love the smell of lavender, but this has more of a perfumey floral scent than a true lavender smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is light, but refreshing.</li>
            <li> What I love also is how it doesn&#x27;t sting my skin when I&#x27;m applying it with a cotton pad because it&#x27;s alcohol free.</li>
            <li> I enjoy shaving, and consider it more of a hobby than a chore, and 2.)</li>
            <li> Very refreshing on a hot day.</li>
            <li> I love that this is alcohol free because it saves my skin.  </li>
            <li> My face is much more smooth and just happier.</li>
            <li> I like the light scent of this variety better.</li>
            <li> I love the cucumber scent, original, lavender and pretty much most of the scents except for the rose scent which I don&#x27;t think I will enjoy.</li>
            <li> Love the fresh lavender scent!</li>
            <li> it might be a bit strong for others liking.</li>
            <li> Not too strong and not too feminine.</li>
            <li> Classic witch hazel good for applying to pimples etc.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so smooth and clean!</li>
            <li> I use it in the morning before serums and moisturizer; at night I use it as a quick cleanser after makeup removal, with a bit of rose hip seed oil and sweet almond oil for night-time care and repair.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice light scent and leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s relatively cheap and easy to find.</li>
            <li> I use this if something starts bleeding, and the bleeding quickly stops!</li>
            <li> and when I do they heal quick!</li>
            <li> It has quickly become my favorite part of my skincare routine.</li>
            <li> Will also use on skin after shaving, it rids razor bumps quickly!</li>
            <li> I took the advice of another reviewer and also used the toner to clean my makeup brushes - and my brushes are as good as new!  </li>
            <li> gentle, alcohol free, the aloe vera is a nice addition as is the Vitamin E.</li>
            <li> I was a huge skeptic of Witch Hazel and even barrated people who recommended it.</li>
            <li> The lavender scent is light and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> So when I switched to DE shaving, I ordered this alcohol free witch hazel toner which was recommended on one of Mantic59&#x27;s YouTube videos.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting for a shave this smooth for years as I am now in my 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s important to heal your face correctly after you shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Thayer for last 2.5 yrs and am happy with the result.  </li>
            <li> Like that it is alcohol free.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic too</li>
            <li> Makes a great facial toner at a fraction of the price of name brand ones.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy having a smooth head, and preferably one with without any irritation.  </li>
            <li> it helped cleared up my bumps nicely, though the alcohol agitated my bumps to an extent, not allowing them to heal as fast as they should.  </li>
            <li> Using witch hazel after a shave is an important part of my shaving routine.</li>
            <li> did some research and found Thayer&#x27;s alcohol free witch hazel products.  </li>
            <li> It also does a great job of removing any extra dirt or oil that you may have on your face after washing.</li>
            <li> , I started using Badger Damascus Rose beauty balm with it and that combo has really healed my combo/acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> light fragrance that doesn&#x27;t linger&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> OK....witch hazel is a simple, ages-old product that does a great job, all by itself.........</li>
            <li> B0084TIFAQ The Homestead Company Alcohol Free Witch</li>
            <li> light fragrance that doesn&#x27;t linger&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> The product came on time and was precisely what I ordered.  </li>
            <li> Love this toner, leaves skin smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li> potential First-timers, Thayers Witch-Hazel, is an all-around great product to have around the house!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have been using witch hazel for about a year now and the smell of just plain witch hazel is not so great!</li>
            <li> me tell you, THIS PRODUCT ABSOLUTELY WORKS!!!  </li>
            <li> My super-sensitive skin feels better immediately, and retains the calm clean feeling well into the day.</li>
            <li> I will purchase the rose (which does smell true to rose) next time.</li>
            <li> the price is fair for such a great product and one that is such a huge part of my &amp;#34;beauty routine.&amp;#34; i plan to continue purchasing as needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the rose toner for much longer time, and after trying this one out, I decided to go back to the rose one because it suits my skin better.</li>
            <li> but it smells amazing and isn&#x27;t too strong for my overly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> Love these toners, I&#x27;m on my third bottle and my skin has never been better!</li>
            <li> After trying to use more natural products on my face, I was in search for a great toner for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It leave me feeling clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> I always follow it up with these toners after I puck my eye brows, trim any hair off of my face/neck/nose or clean my pores with the instruments that assists in removing blackheads, etc.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s gentle and free of anything harmful :)</li>
            <li> Scent is light and clean and fades quickly.</li>
            <li> They pick up and clean my pores so well.</li>
            <li> The toner shrinks your pores so after washing and exfoliating, close them up while they&#x27;re still clean with this toner.</li>
            <li> I subsequently purchased the Thayers rose scented version and that scent is much better.  </li>
            <li> I see a distinct reduction in redness, inflammation, dryness, irritation and fine lines within one day of use.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an astringent without alcohol, and was a little concerned about the fragrance, but it is very light and pleasant.</li>
            <li> :B002QG3QBQ Taylor of Old Bond Street Rose Shaving Cream]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Ive rebought this at whole foods many times after.</li>
            <li> It was a good price, the purchase was sealed and arrived quickly enough.</li>
            <li> I use a good cleanser and a Clarisonic, and the toner always lifts off the last particles of city pollution and dirt from my face, neck, and decolleté.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s surprisingly moisturizing, so I use it as such.</li>
            <li> I really like the product, but don&#x27;t love the scent.</li>
            <li> I also love that It&#x27;s gentle and non-drying.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> While you can feel that somethings on your face, it&#x27;s not a bad sticky or yucky feel to it.  </li>
            <li> This is a really good compromise for price and it does have cleansing as well as a moisturizing effect so you can use this if you&#x27;re in a big rush and don&#x27;t have time for a full routine.</li>
            <li> I then use my moisturizer on top and so far it seems like everything is fine.  </li>
            <li> My favorite new toiletry find!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright, doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling as fresh and clean as alcohol-based toners</li>

            <li> Shopping was quick, but when I received my package, it was leaking out the package.</li>
            <li> I love lavender, and use the essential oil and lavender scents for many things.</li>
            <li> And to top it off it leaves my face feeling soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice enough in that it is alcohol free witch hazel.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t contain any alcohol, smells great, really clears out extra gunk from your skin, and softens it as well.</li>
            <li> shipped quickly; helping to reduce redness on my face without drying</li>
            <li> I use it regularly and very pleased with the results.</li>

            <li> only a week my skin is smoother and more supple, as well as more clear and even has more of a glow to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> only a week my skin is smoother and more supple, as well as more clear and even has more of a glow to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have spent THOUSANDS of dollars on finding the perfect shave, as I enjoy being clean shaven every single day.  </li>
            <li> It came very quick and was packaged very well.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on my skin but still leaves a clean feeling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing like the clinique one that burns a little - this is very soothing and smells incredible.</li>
            <li> Trust me when I say that it helps calm the skin.</li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s alcohol free and the lavender is really soothing.</li>
            <li> I have been using Thayer&#x27;s Rose Witch Hazel for several years now.  </li>
            <li> I love that this product is natural and does just what it says.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took a while to find a replacement, but Thayer&#x27;s is worth the effort.  </li>
            <li> Worth the price</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no drying effects, but it cleanses just as powerfully as stronger toners I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> think I may try their rose scent next!</li>
            <li> Fresh.</li>
            <li> and i don&#x27;t feel fresh after using it.</li>
            <li> By far, Thayer&#x27;s Lavender is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Most others irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually surprised that I don&#x27;t see more reviews on the scent of the lavender version.</li>
            <li> This stuff works good and really calms red irritated skin.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this witch hazel, and so far it isn&#x27;t making my face break out, like witch hazel with alcohol does.</li>
            <li> It was delivered very quickly and nicely packed although the lid on one bottle was slightly damaged.</li>
            <li> For my needs, they&#x27;re just right.</li>
            <li> Received right away and just what I needed</li>
            <li> Use as a toner after a shower &amp; as a quick facial cleanse before bed, love the scent..</li>
            <li> But it certainly isn&#x27;t hurting it!</li>
            <li> The toner however, is effective; it calms my sensitive skin and locks in moisture leaving my skin soft.  </li>

            <li> have the entire family using this product and we all love it.</li>
            <li> Most importantly no traditional witch hazel scent.</li>
            <li> Really like this item!</li>
            <li> I use it for so many different things.</li>
            <li> This is such a refreshing way to perk up your skin throughout the day or remove make-up.</li>
            <li> This was my first time to use witch hazel</li>
            <li> Works very well!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Thayer&#x27;s product and I will be keeping this in my routine for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> I use it to cleanse my face first thing in the morning, before moisturizing.</li>
            <li> If you need your pores to look better for something the next day, I&#x27;d use it the night before, though.</li>
            <li> I really like this toner!</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> At first, all I could find was the Witch Hazel w/alcohol ...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give that tingly sensation so many people like, but I can say that this stuff actually works.</li>
            <li> and I really like it!</li>
            <li> Good product, I use it to keep face moistured everyday and it worked out well.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it contains no alcohol, but still makes my skin smooth and tight.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I switched from a toner that also had rose in it as well as lavender that I loved so much, but was too costly.</li>
            <li> It works well, smells good, seems to help prevent razor burn and sooth the slightly raw skin I get from shaving.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s my daily shaving set up: Astra Superior Platinum DE blades, an adjustable Merkur Progress safety razor, PlantLife organic coconut and vanilla facial soap, Art of Shaving Lavender shaving cream, and Art of Shaving Lavender aftershave.  </li>
            <li> The rose variety has fake rose scent too....</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with this product, and I know it is loved by many.</li>
            <li> and it leaves such a relieving clean feeling!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad that I chose an alcohol-free version because it doesn&#x27;t irritate or overly dry my skin.</li>
            <li> The lavender scent is very mild and only noticeable when applying, and doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> I typically use rose water for an all-natural toner, but when I came across this lavender witch hazel toner I had to try it.</li>
            <li> I love this because it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Very soothing and can be used as a fast take off of makeup when I don&#x27;t have much time!</li>
            <li> and you get a large bottle</li>
            <li> The smell of the lavender fragrance used in this smells similar to cheap lavender soap and it is very vile.  </li>
            <li> gentle on skin.</li>
            <li> She began to use the lavendar witch hazel morning and night and her skin is much clearer now.</li>
            <li> I really like this toner.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and shave like a real man.  </li>
            <li> It leaves the skin ready for moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I also tried it on my face and it works really well as a toner.</li>
            <li> But with the Thayer&#x27;s toner, my skin has improved so much.</li>
            <li> I will go back to using Neutrogena&#x27;s alcohol free toner.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It really soothes the skin and moisturizes the skin.  </li>
            <li> So at times, I use it when my oily skin becomes too much to handle.  </li>
            <li> Oh boy I am very impressed!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Very soothing and calming.</li>
            <li> Really like it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> this is the 3rd time i have ordered from this seller and everything comes packaged and sealed securely.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and this toner does not seem to help much.</li>
            <li> you are looking for a REAL lavender smell, try [ASIN:</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to using this stuff.</li>
            <li> Gentle on the skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a natural, fresh product</li>
            <li> It came fast.</li>
            <li> , you name it - after my evening showers (when my pores are open) and it&#x27;s been fantastic.</li>
            <li> I cleanse afterwards with my gently cleanser and then moisturize.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great;it&#x27;s gentle</li>
            <li> My 15yr old daughter had teen acne, and we tried many products with dissapointment.  </li>
            <li> I have only ever purchased the Lavender and Rose ones, but I&#x27;m definitely going to start purchasing some of the others.</li>
            <li> , To get the benefits of rose I was missing out on with this toner</li>
            <li> Great product, gentle on skin, subtle, natural fragrance - and no alcohol.</li>
            <li> I also detest that the bottle is not travel friendly once you open the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Very gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> extra ingredients helps the skin heal nicely, and doesn&#x27;t dry out, causing the bumps to fade away a lot faster.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t entirely tell whether it doses anything for normal skin, but it you&#x27;ve just shaved it&#x27;s great for making small mistakes heal faster.</li>
            <li> saw a video online that recommended keeping this in the refrigerator for an extra cool sensation.  </li>
            <li> I still have an almost full bottle, and I will use it up, so if my opinion changes, I&#x27;ll edit this in the future.</li>
            <li> Usually, I go towards the rose scent, but this time I opted for the lavender.</li>
            <li> I think this toner is my new obsession!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without my Thayer&#x27;s witch hazel!  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to say that there&#x27;s much difference between the scents that I&#x27;ve tried (rose and lavender).</li>
            <li> It smells more like baby wipes and less like lavender.</li>
            <li> neither have alcohol (most witch hazel toners have hidden alcohol).</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend seller.</li>
            <li> i like the kinda old school packaging and like to keep it on my vanity, but it feels great straight from the fridge nice and cold on insect bites or sunburn!!</li>
            <li> It has made this 82 year old skin look much softer.</li>
            <li> Soothing my sensitive skin and very hydrating.</li>
            <li> but good for usual daily use.</li>
            <li> I tried using it a few times more hoping the fragrance would \\&quot;grow\\&quot; on me, but that didn&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li> I have normal skin ..</li>
            <li> It is more expensive since it&#x27;s smaller, but I liked it a lot.</li>
            <li> alas, this lavender doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the peach scent</li>
            <li> and I had to stop using any kind of cleanser earlier this year and just start toners instead to wipe down in the morning and evening,</li>
            <li> I use it every single day as a refreshing facial toner.  </li>
            <li> I like this better than plain Witch Hazel.</li>
            <li> Absolutely can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I almost gave a bottle to a new mom friend of mine</li>
            <li> i refuse to live without it.</li>
            <li> My bottle came in its standard packaging (a generic ziplock bag fit for its size).</li>
            <li> i have only used the lavender and it&#x27;s very gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> I am all for natural &amp; organic &amp; this product fits the bill!  </li>
            <li> worth the money and will continue to buy for a long time to come!</li>

            <li> Although I am a repeat buyer this is the FIRST time this has happened and only so far.</li>
            <li> Also, it hasn&#x27;t done anything to help clear up my skin or heal the acne I do have.  </li>
            <li> , it keeps your skin clear and protected from dirt</li>
            <li> It helps keep the skin soft and if you have any nicks or cuts it helps them.</li>

            <li> and i have sensitive, finicky skin.</li>
            <li> The scent is not heavy or overpowering.</li>
            <li> My toner was broken from the top lid and there was a whole in the seal.</li>
            <li> Slightly more expensive, it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Good toner doesn&#x27;t have to be expensive.</li>
            <li> I personally, do notice and feel the subtle yet appreciative changes Thayers Witch Hazel does for my face in the morning before make-up and afterwards before I sleep.</li>
            <li> The lavender fragrance is a little intense at first, medicinal-like.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why other people love it s much</li>
            <li> highly recommend getting a spray bottle and using this as a facial moisturizer after the shower.</li>
            <li> But is it different than the Rose-Thayers Witch Hazel (non-alcoholic) I normally get?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a large bottle that will laster a decade longer than the more expensive Art of Shaving products.</li>
            <li> , it is so clear and also not dry anymore.</li>
            <li> Thayer&#x27;s formulas are gentle and non-toxic, and they don&#x27;t dry out the skin.</li>
            <li> It thoroughly cleans any residue left from washing and leaves a blank canvas ready to absorb my serum and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Definitely part is staying part of daily routine until there can be no more. :)&lt;</li>
            <li> and I have noticed major improvement in pore size.  </li>
            <li> a little burning if you apply it after you deep clean your face</li>

            <li> fast, carefully packed.</li>
            <li> I worked at Teen Vogue and learned about Witch Hazel&#x27;s natural anti-inflammatory properties, so decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> Personally I use it directly after shaving (face and head), and then I follow it up with some aftershave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m contemplating installing a small college dorm fridge just to keep this cool.  </li>
            <li> Works ok but not worth the money...found a clone at my local supermarket for half the price</li>
            <li> I also can&#x27;t live without it after giving birth to soothe the perineum, or for after sun/sunburn care, or use on minor scrapes, burns or rashes.</li>
            <li> Product was fine but came with lid half off leaking all over other items purchased.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t loaded up with anything artificial and has a very light lavender scent, but not so much that it can&#x27;t be used by men as an aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Before shaving the old fashioned way, which was really tried and true, I regretfully shaved with expensive multi-blade razor cartridges.  </li>
            <li> Does not dry out my skin in anyway</li>
            <li> Does not dry out skin.</li>
            <li> I have acne rosacea and my skin is extremely sensitive - this product calms my red irritated skin has a lovely (but faint) lavender scent.  </li>
            <li> I am pretty disciplined with my skin- regimen and use it twice a day everyday in combination with balm balm&#x27;s coconut cleanser and moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It has really toned down the oiliness and helps my makeup stay on my face a lot longer.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry skin or agitate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> So far no new breakouts have appeared and it keeps my skin moisturized</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s doing much to enhance my complexion.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use this long enough to determine if it made a difference on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I started using this after a friend suggested it to me when I was in the dry mountains of Colorado last summer.</li>
            <li> However, I never liked the smell of pure witch hazel.  </li>
            <li> , I know I&#x27;ve talked too long, but, to sum this review up, this product works as it helps to close your pores after you shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used witch hazel as an astringent after Sea Breeze became harder to find locally.  </li>
            <li> Overall it soothes the skin and moisturizes as expected.</li>
            <li> No tight, harsh chemical feel after application.</li>
            <li> Until I twisted off the top to break the seal, the seal felt somewhat damped already, which made me suspect if this product had already been slightly used or tampered with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural toner and was going to buy plain witch hazel</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day and mix it with tea tree oil to make hair/scalp spray, mix it with other essential oil to make body splash, and even for laundry.</li>
            <li> This will be my go to witch hazel as long as I can buy it!</li>
            <li> (for example if you robbed your face with cleanser which contains tiny little exfoliating beads in it, or if you used facial brush, etc).</li>
            <li> Compared to other after shaves such as Anthony Logistics</li>
            <li> So you might as well buy this one to save some $$$ for the other products that actually do.</li>
            <li> While other toners tend to dry out my skin, this one actually moisturizes and brightens.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with acne for a very long time.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all.  </li>
            <li> but then again it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out, either.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin in the slightest bit</li>
            <li> It does not sting, burn and/or dry out the skin as it has no alcohol.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t over dry the skin.</li>
            <li> I just wash my face and apply this toner and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> The dry heat from the house radiators</li>
            <li> but I could tell it was dry.  </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin at all.</li>
            <li> but this toner is now in my daily routine and i haven&#x27;t had any winter dryness this year and know it&#x27;s due to this witch hazel toner!</li>
            <li> Even in the thick of the summer heat and humidity, when I use it straight for a week, my skin develops dry and rough patches, and I have extremely oily skin.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin!</li>
            <li> No rash, irritation or odd after-scent or &amp;#34;dead skin / white flaky alcohol&amp;#34; residue.</li>
            <li> after all, having cleansed it thoroughly the night before, the only thing on my face in the morning is a little oil.</li>
            <li> This may sound crazy but I have the room in my bathroom and/or walk-in closet.  </li>
            <li> The lavender scent is not overwhelming and doesn&#x27;t last a long time once the toner is applied.  </li>
            <li> Its only been a few days</li>
            <li> No, thanks.</li>
            <li> just be careful.</li>
            <li> I had recently picked up a job working as a mechanic, i work with alot of chemicals and grease which dried out my skin or made me breakout from dirtying my pores</li>
            <li> But I wouldn&#x27;t make a habit out of it because it&#x27;s not really meant for cleaning.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.  </li>
            <li> Not sure yet since I just barely got it.</li>
            <li> Although if in a month or two it doesn&#x27;t give me that same wonderful, fresh-cooling feeling, or worse yet, causes enlarged pores, a breakout or horrible allergic reaction!</li>
            <li> I mix it half and half with distiller water and add 5-6 drops of lavender essential oil for a toner.</li>
            <li> Proraso (New Formula- Green Tube), Shave Secret, and have tried several after shaves.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a few news articles lately that dispute the benefits of using a toner, but if you live in place like LA, as I do, then I think the benefits can&#x27;t be overstated.</li>
            <li> Just over the past week I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in softness of my skin, and just an overall clarity.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re wondering about some of the other products I shave with, they are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> You can also use it on other areas.</li>
            <li> Never having used Witch Hazel before, I was going off of other reviews when I made the chose of this product.  </li>
            <li> Have been using for past several days - once in morning, once at night.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Thayers brand (lavender as well as other thayers) exclusively for over 6months.</li>
            <li> I will buy this again and try the other scents.  </li>
            <li> Average product.</li>
            <li> It tones my face, takes off any remaining makeup left behind from my face wash and doesn&#x27;t dry my face out.</li>
            <li> The lavender scent is not very strong, but that does not concern me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously used don&#x27;t perform as well.</li>
            <li> The truth is, though, that when I use it, I don&#x27;t get much of a sensation other then that of a cold water splash.</li>
            <li> I pour a little witch hazel on a cotton ball and rub it into the problem areas.</li>
            <li> My skin a little sticky after this one..</li>
            <li> I like the smell, but oddly I always have weird dreams if I apply this near my nose at night</li>
            <li> Use it with a cotton round, not cotton ball.</li>
            <li> We men get few pleasures all to ourselves.  </li>
            <li> I always thought that toners dried out my skin</li>
            <li> I use this every few days after washing my face at night.</li>
            <li> Totally Non Irritating.</li>
            <li> I use as an aftershave when I know I did it poorly and regular aftershave is going to hurt a lot.(I</li>
            <li> Apply with a cotton round twice a day after washing your face and you will literally never get pimples.</li>
            <li> this dried my skin.</li>
            <li> I have skin that is very difficult to manage: sensitive, break out prone, dry AND oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to stick to the plain one from now on.</li>
            <li> However, the cap was broken after several days when I opened it as usual.</li>
            <li> It REALLY helps when you give yourself a bad shave....</li>
            <li> I have a really oily t-zone and was having issues with my skin overproducing oil with another toner I was using because it was stripping my skin so badly.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a small learning curve to shave this way</li>
            <li> Been using this for the past 4 years</li>
            <li> Needless to say, it&#x27;ll last a while.  </li>
            <li> my face have not been as oily like it&#x27;s been in the past.  </li>
            <li> but I was not sure.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and my skin can get pretty inflamed and itches like crazy!</li>
            <li> I also use it as a face mister to hydrate my skin by diluting it with water in a small spray bottle I carry around.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I just can&#x27;t get past the \\&quot;lavender\\&quot; smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read a lot of articles online that witch hazel has a bad smell to it, but honestly, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all.</li>
            <li> Much less irritated and redness decreased dramatically.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find witch hazel without alcohol in it.</li>
            <li> Hardly ever get breakouts anymore</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s something you don&#x27;t see much lately.</li>
            <li> As other reviews have stated it smells like baby wipes or fake powder or something.</li>
            <li> Cleanse, soothes, tones, and smells just wonderfully subtle.</li>
            <li> Seriously?</li>
            <li> If she gets even one flea bite she will be itchy for at least a weak.</li>
            <li> I use this product immediately after I rinse my face with cold water after the DE shave, then, I follow up with my aftershave while my face is still somewhat wet.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t taste too bad if you accidentally get some in your mouth, and one bottle goes a long way for me.</li>
            <li> I stopped using this product for a weak and my skin broke out.</li>
            <li> Not in an artificial way, but just a bit odd when compared to the rest of my regimen.</li>
            <li> If I had to pick one beauty product as the secret to my youthful skin (I&#x27;m in my 30s</li>
            <li> and at least for me they all failed to do the job</li>
            <li> Not happy with that aspect</li>
            <li> Not only was shaving expensive, but, it was very painful.  </li>
            <li> It arrived on time and it wasn&#x27;t expensive</li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t Go wrong w/ this brand as well.</li>
            <li> When I received my package, I opened it and found the bottle cap is broken and some of the liquids has come out!</li>
            <li> Sorry I have to give you 2 stars.</li>
            <li> It leaks like crazy.</li>
            <li> I hope that Thayers stops using artificial fragrances.</li>
            <li> face is really crazy</li>
            <li> The bottle cap is broken and some of the liquids has come out!!</li>
            <li> About twice a year, during Allergy flare ups, I tend to get bad irritated skin, and bumps after shaving, though they are not razor bumps.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very disappointing!</li>
            <li> I had nasty razor bumps and razor burn.  </li>
            <li> so terrible.</li>
            <li> It worked well on my face, but it smelled HORRIBLE!  </li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m the annoying guy telling everyone I know about it!</li>

            <li> This is such a refreshing toner. Just over the past week I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in softness of my skin, and just an overall clarity. I will order it again once I run out. It arrived on time and it wasn&#x27;t expensive so it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ll be adding into my routine on a regular basis. It&#x27;s very gentle yet effective. :)</li>
            <li> The best Alcohol Free toner!</li>
            <li> greatest facial product ever !!!  the perfect astringent before bed and before makeup application</li>
            <li> I Love Love Love This Product!!!!! My Skin Looks Awesome!!!  I Will Definitely Be Purchasing This Again!!!!</li>
            <li> Good stuff!  Exactly what I wanted.  Totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> Excellent service from seller. Excellent natural toner. Lavender scent is very mild and pleasant.</li>
            <li> Much better for my skin than the witch hazel that contains alcohol. The lavender scent is light and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Love this toner!  I have acne rosacea and my skin is extremely sensitive - this product calms my red irritated skin has a lovely (but faint) lavender scent.  I have read some reviews from folks that don&#x27;t like a product that has any scent, but dont let that keep you from getting this - the scent is lovely while applying, but will not linger on.  I have been using each morning and evening after I wash my face and love how it makes my skin feel.  Much less irritated and redness decreased dramatically.  Product arrived quickly &amp; packaged well.</li>
            <li> love the smell. gentle on skin.</li>
            <li> Great size. Smells great. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin!</li>
            <li> I tend to break out with rashes and or bumps every time I shave. I bought this Thayers witch hazel toner because of all the 5 Star  reviews. So happy I did.  Slapped some of this on after a nice straight razor shave and voilà!!!!  Going to subscribe to this stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite toner now! I strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love all of these toners! Just as great as the rosewater scent!</li>
            <li> Thayer&#x27;s witch hazel has become a part of my twice-daily routine, and my husband&#x27;s too. I see a distinct reduction in redness, inflammation, dryness, irritation and fine lines within one day of use. If I had to pick one beauty product as the secret to my youthful skin (I&#x27;m in my 30s but no one believes I&#x27;m above 26), I&#x27;d pick this one. Absolutely can&#x27;t live without it. And that&#x27;s just using it as a toner. I also can&#x27;t live without it after giving birth to soothe the perineum, or for after sun/sunburn care, or use on minor scrapes, burns or rashes. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> My 15yr old daughter had teen acne, and we tried many products with dissapointment.  She began to use the lavendar witch hazel morning and night and her skin is much clearer now. It cleanses, tones and moisturizes.  No drying, no irritation. She still has monthly breakouts, but most of the time it looks great, and her breakout scars heal quickly.      I have been using the ROSE version for years, it is a nice refreshing toner.  Removes mascara. Use it with a cotton round, not cotton ball.</li>
            <li> I recently started shaving with a DE razor, and this stuff is great after shaving and before Aftershave!!!!!    It helps keep the skin soft and if you have any nicks or cuts it helps them. It REALLY helps when you give yourself a bad shave....</li>
            <li> I really like this toner. I use it after washing my face at night and in the morning. I have noticed an evening of my skin tone and reduced redness after use. I will definitely repurchase this.</li>
            <li> I recently ventured into DE (Double Edged) shaving with a safety razor.  Before shaving the old fashioned way, which was really tried and true, I regretfully shaved with expensive multi-blade razor cartridges.  Not only was shaving expensive, but, it was very painful.  I had nasty razor bumps and razor burn.  So when I switched to DE shaving, I ordered this alcohol free witch hazel toner which was recommended on one of Mantic59&#x27;s YouTube videos.  If you are interested in switching over to the smartest (and cheapest) way to shave in luxury, I recommend watching Mantic59 videos and joining the [...] forum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you, THIS PRODUCT ABSOLUTELY WORKS!!!  It truly works if you combine this with a good pre-shave preparation and post shave regimen.  Here&#x27;s my daily shaving set up: Astra Superior Platinum DE blades, an adjustable Merkur Progress safety razor, PlantLife organic coconut and vanilla facial soap, Art of Shaving Lavender shaving cream, and Art of Shaving Lavender aftershave.  You can purchase all of these products here on Amazon as I did with most.  I use this product immediately after I rinse my face with cold water after the DE shave, then, I follow up with my aftershave while my face is still somewhat wet.  I am African American and have suffered with razor bumps ever since I started full time shaving at the age of 18.  I&#x27;ve been waiting for a shave this smooth for years as I am now in my 30&#x27;s and I&#x27;ve finally found it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ATTENTION ALL MEN:  Do yourself a favor and shave like a real man.  We men get few pleasures all to ourselves.  There&#x27;s a reason why our grandfathers shaved this way for decades.  It&#x27;s because it works.  There&#x27;s a small learning curve to shave this way but once you do learn you will never ever go back to multi blade shaving.  I have spent THOUSANDS of dollars on finding the perfect shave, as I enjoy being clean shaven every single day.  I&#x27;ve bought all the multiblade systems, electric clippers, rotary shavers, foil shavers, etc. and at least for me they all failed to do the job right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, I know I&#x27;ve talked too long, but, to sum this review up, this product works as it helps to close your pores after you shave.  The all natural ingredients also help act as an antiseptic in addition to adding back some moisture to your face.  When you think about it, you are slicing layers of your skin off when you shave so it&#x27;s important to heal your face correctly after you shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw a video online that recommended keeping this in the refrigerator for an extra cool sensation.  This may sound crazy but I have the room in my bathroom and/or walk-in closet.  I&#x27;m contemplating installing a small college dorm fridge just to keep this cool.  If you&#x27;re wondering about some of the other products I shave with, they are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003YJALDU Avocado Shaving Cream 5.3oz shaving cream by Taylor of Old Bond Street]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00020UQQQ Truefitt &amp; Hill 1805 Shave Cream Jar]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000IB0G96 Geo F.

            <li> Thayer&#x27;s: I use in every product that I create!! Trust me when I say that it helps calm the skin.</li>
            <li> Love!! I noticed a visible difference in my skin&#x27;s texture as well as in my pores within 1-2 applications.  My skin feels so smooth and clean!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried the Lavender and I will be getting it again. It has a very pleasant scent; not too over powering.  Good combination with the Witch Hazel.  I feel quite refreshed after using it and it&#x27;s very good for my skin too!  Great product!</li>
            <li> It has made this 82 year old skin look much softer. I purchased more bottles to give to some friends...who are also seeing benefits.</li>
            <li> I use it for several uses on various parts.  It cleans  my face at night, refreshes in the morning. You can also use it on other areas. Smell and feel are lovely.</li>
            <li> why bother making an all natural toner and then add synthetic fragrance ??? Makes zero sense to me. The company tries to make you think it&#x27;s all natural because it just simply states &amp;#34;natural lavender fragrance&amp;#34; . As other reviews have stated it smells like baby wipes or fake powder or something. Not lavender . Why not just use essential oil of lavender ?? I bought this thinking that&#x27;s what I was getting , an alcohol free toner with natural ingredients. Wrong. It&#x27;s very disappointing! I&#x27;m going to stick to the plain one from now on. The rose variety has fake rose scent too....</li>
            <li> Nice product. Makes your skin feels like it breathing when you apply it. No tight, harsh chemical feel after application. Ive rebought this at whole foods many times after.</li>
            <li> Nice, clean scent.  I like this toner as I have also tried the Rose scent. It leaves the skin ready for moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love Thayers products; have used most of the scents and this one and the rose is the best.  Doesn&#x27;t dry skin or agitate my sensitive skin.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I use this in leu of face wash and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> The best toner ever ! Cleanse, soothes, tones, and smells just wonderfully subtle. One bottle lasts for 2-3 months depending on how often you use. I use it twice a day and mix it with tea tree oil to make hair/scalp spray, mix it with other essential oil to make body splash, and even for laundry. I&#x27;ve used Clinique, SK-II, Lancôme, Estée Lauder, and DHC among many others.  Nothing better than this. I&#x27;ve been using Thayer for last 2.5 yrs and am happy with the result.  Gosh, I hope Thayer doesn&#x27;t realize how good it is and increase the price :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the rose and lavender scents of this aftershave, and it&#x27;s great. Combine it with an alum block, and if your skin needs it an aftershave balm, for a superior post shave system.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love witch hazel and this one has an added benefit of smelling like lavender.</li>
            <li> I started using this after a friend suggested it to me when I was in the dry mountains of Colorado last summer. I always thought that toners dried out my skin but this toner is now in my daily routine and i haven&#x27;t had any winter dryness this year and know it&#x27;s due to this witch hazel toner! i have only used the lavender and it&#x27;s very gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have been using witch hazel for about a year now and the smell of just plain witch hazel is not so great! Lol I decided to give this a go and I like it. It tones my face, takes off any remaining makeup left behind from my face wash and doesn&#x27;t dry my face out. The smell is ok, not my favorite, I have another scent by this brand that I enjoy much more.</li>
            <li> Been using this for the past 4 years and I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I like this better than plain Witch Hazel. I don&#x27;t have to moisturize my face after I use it (unless it&#x27;s a day where I&#x27;ve done a face mask and exfoliated) because the lavender in the formula is moisturizing enough.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it contains no alcohol, but still makes my skin smooth and tight. Seems to reduce the size of pores as well.</li>
            <li> Never having used Witch Hazel before, I was going off of other reviews when I made the chose of this product.  I am very impressed with Thayers and will diffently buy this again and again!  It has helped with several skin irritants and is very soothing.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with this product, and I know it is loved by many. The truth is, though, that when I use it, I don&#x27;t get much of a sensation other then that of a cold water splash. I prefer a non-alcoholic after shave balm (check out prorasa pre-post).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure this stuff is great if you are a witch hazel fan, I just don&#x27;t perceive the benefits for myself. I still have an almost full bottle, and I will use it up, so if my opinion changes, I&#x27;ll edit this in the future.</li>
            <li> I will always use Thayer&#x27;s for my face and for cuts and sores. I am very sensitive and this witch hazel toner is wonderful. I can use it w/o any irritation to my skin. I love the cucumber scent, original, lavender and pretty much most of the scents except for the rose scent which I don&#x27;t think I will enjoy. I always follow it up with these toners after I puck my eye brows, trim any hair off of my face/neck/nose or clean my pores with the instruments that assists in removing blackheads, etc.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I use it regularly and very pleased with the results. Leaves skin feeling moisturized and refreshed.</li>
            <li> My dog has a severe flea allergy. If she gets even one flea bite she will be itchy for at least a weak. I read on a lot of different websites that witch hazel can ease the itching. Thayers had great reviews so I decided to buy some and give it a try. My dog completely stops itching when I put this on her. Its only been a few days but she loves it. I also tried it on my face and it works really well as a toner. I love the lavender scent but lavender is one of my favorite scents. it might be a bit strong for others liking.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for this brand of witch hazel everywhere and found it on Amazon. I read a lot of articles online that witch hazel has a bad smell to it, but honestly, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all. It has a refreshing scent to it!</li>
            <li> Love Thayer Witch Hazel....its a great toner, smells nice and leaves your skin feeling clean and fresh. Will buy more in the future!</li>
            <li> Love the fresh lavender scent! I use it on my face almost daily b/c it&#x27;s gentle and free of anything harmful :)</li>
            <li> It was as described. I used it to refresh/cleanse my scalp while wearing braids. I loved the smell. It didn&#x27;t irritate my scalp. I actually wanted to bath in it because of the relief it brought from these itchy extensions.</li>
            <li> It smells so nice and it relaxes me when I cleanse my face with it before bed.</li>
            <li> This toner has worked phenomenally! I have a really oily t-zone and was having issues with my skin overproducing oil with another toner I was using because it was stripping my skin so badly. But with the Thayer&#x27;s toner, my skin has improved so much. It has really toned down the oiliness and helps my makeup stay on my face a lot longer. So glad I decided to try this out, it&#x27;s definitely become a staple of my skincare routine.</li>
            <li> Use this after shaving and at night before bed.  Much better than soap at cleaning the day&#x27;s grime off.  Also acts as a nice splash after shaving to tighten pores and prepare for post shave lotion.</li>
            <li> The lavender fragrance is a little intense at first, medicinal-like.  The toner however, is effective; it calms my sensitive skin and locks in moisture leaving my skin soft.  The bottle is huge!  Needless to say, it&#x27;ll last a while.  It was a good price, the purchase was sealed and arrived quickly enough.</li>
            <li> So far great product no complaints</li>
            <li> Smells great and tones the skin very well</li>
            <li> Average product. Not sure why other people love it s much</li>
            <li> I have been using Thayer&#x27;s Rose Witch Hazel for several years now.  I use it as a toner, as a spray to help set my makeup (but before mascara, since I don&#x27;t use waterproof), and with paper masks.  I have loved it.  I got the lavender scent this time, just to try it out.  It is a very nice, clean scent and works just as well as the Rose version.  I&#x27;ll probably switch back and forth between the two to mix things up.</li>
            <li> Perfect for skin upkeep, nice and gentle but helps prevent razor burn and irritation bumps</li>
            <li> My facial lady recommended this product to use in my face routine. My face is so great now, it is so clear and also not dry anymore. I would totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> I will finish off what I have because this product does refresh and it does not contain alcohol.  However, it does not smell good.  My husband always prods what product he&#x27;s smelling -- and not in a good way.  I myself don&#x27;t care for it.  Also, it hasn&#x27;t done anything to help clear up my skin or heal the acne I do have.  I know my acne is hormone related since I just had a baby and am nursing, but this still has done nothing to help.  I will not buy this again.  I will go back to using Neutrogena&#x27;s alcohol free toner.  It smells so much better and works just as good as a toner.</li>
            <li> spells great and very moisturizing</li>
            <li> Smells great, feels good on my skin! Fast shipping, would buy from again!</li>
            <li> I love Thayer&#x27;s alcohol-free toners. The rose and lavender formulas are superb. I&#x27;ve seen a few news articles lately that dispute the benefits of using a toner, but if you live in place like LA, as I do, then I think the benefits can&#x27;t be overstated. I use a good cleanser and a Clarisonic, and the toner always lifts off the last particles of city pollution and dirt from my face, neck, and decolleté. Thayer&#x27;s formulas are gentle and non-toxic, and they don&#x27;t dry out the skin. For my needs, they&#x27;re just right. Even $40 (and toxic) toners I&#x27;ve previously used don&#x27;t perform as well.</li>
            <li> Nice toner for my oily skin will purchase this again.  It helps out with my t-zone plus I have oily skin in those areas.  Notice once I started using this my face have not been as oily like it&#x27;s been in the past.  Very good product will recommend.</li>
            <li> I use it for all sorts of skin irritations. I just love it. Ii wonder if it would be good for babies diaper rash? I almost gave a bottle to a new mom friend of mine but I was not sure. Linda Russell</li>
            <li> This is my favorite witch hazel! I like the rose too, but my face seems to like the lavender one better. I use it as a facial toner before bed or after a shower.</li>
            <li> Great service. I got exactly what I wanted. Thanks</li>
            <li> Love this toner!!  Thayers is a good brand, love that it&#x27;s alcohol free and I love the fresh smell of Lavender!!  This is my toner of choice!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful.  I love using it after I wash my face (AM and PM).  It leave me feeling clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> I really love this Witch Hazel.  I grew up where my grandmother had you put witch hazel on everything so I&#x27;m no stranger to the benefits of witch hazel.  But this is not like your grandmother&#x27;s witch hazel.  It really soothes the skin and moisturizes the skin.  I use this at night as a moisturizer and in the morning before I apply my sun screen.  I even use it o my eyes after I remove my make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the entire family using this product and we all love it. I definitely recommend this product for the entire family.</li>
            <li> love, love, love this witch hazel, lavender scent is gorgeous. I have ordered this a second time and will continue to order in the future. Excellent product and the order is always on time and perfect.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and works wonders!!</li>
            <li> The scent is soft and it does the trick. Does not dry out my skin in anyway and my skin feels nice and clean afterward. Will be getting more when this runs out.</li>
            <li> This witch hazel is great! Scent is light and clean and fades quickly. Skin feel great afterward. Most importantly no traditional witch hazel scent.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s hard to find witch hazel without alcohol in it. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all.  It&#x27;s the perfect toner!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Does not contain alcohol which is very important when it comes to toners.  Does not dry out skin.</li>
            <li> good product, just as described, came to me very quickly.</li>
            <li> Works ok but not worth the money...found a clone at my local supermarket for half the price</li>
            <li> It Is just a darn good product</li>
            <li> Nice to find this lavender witch hazel.</li>
            <li> Good product.&lt;br /&gt;Works well with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> But to add that I do like this one, it is just that I can&#x27;t use it often.  I suspect that it is the lavender it contains.  Even in the thick of the summer heat and humidity, when I use it straight for a week, my skin develops dry and rough patches, and I have extremely oily skin.  So at times, I use it when my oily skin becomes too much to handle.  If your skin can tolerate lavender and have oily skin, this is a good choice.  I also detest that the bottle is not travel friendly once you open the bottle.  It leaks like crazy.</li>
            <li> This alcohol-free witch hazel has a lovely fragrance and does the job! It was delivered very quickly and nicely packed although the lid on one bottle was slightly damaged. No problemo -- I found a spare lid in my collection.</li>
            <li> It smells more like baby wipes and less like lavender. I will not get this scent again; I prefer the rose scent to this one.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  The scent is great, cost is great, effects are great.  I recommend buying it with organic cotton balls.</li>
            <li> I am using this product for years. Very gentle on the skin. I use it asva cleaning as well not just refreshing.</li>
            <li> I used this toner after I heard it&#x27;s a great natural alternative to aftershave and acne toner. Oh boy I am very impressed!&lt;br /&gt;First, this toner contains literally all-natural ingredients and NO ALCOHOL! No wonder my skin feels refreshed and not irritated after I shaved my facial hair. I also use this toner as part of my acne regimen after using my acne facial cleanser which makes my face moisturized and not irritated when I put on my prescription acne creams. The witch hazel is what I&#x27;m not fond of because it is proven to irritate skin but the vegetable glycerin and the aloe juice, I think, cancels out the irritative properties of it. I definitely personally recommend this as a toner and an aftershave!</li>
            <li> Good,but the rose is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Thayer Witch Hazel is a great toner. It has a nice light scent and leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh. I also use this to freshen my yoga mat.</li>
            <li> Pleasant fragrance.  This is a liquid so you need to apply it with a cotton ball or put it in a spray bottle..  Wish it was a gel like the Jason product that is not made anymore.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on my sensitive skin. Doesn&#x27;t burn or sting...just refreshing 😊</li>
            <li> Organic Witch Hazel is Life! You can&#x27;t Go wrong w/ this brand as well.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It came very quick and was packaged very well. Will buy again when needed.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t entirely tell whether it doses anything for normal skin, but it you&#x27;ve just shaved it&#x27;s great for making small mistakes heal faster.</li>
            <li> Received right away and just what I needed</li>
            <li> Love this toner! I mix it half and half with distiller water and add 5-6 drops of lavender essential oil for a toner. I love that this is already a toner and alcohol free. This will be my go to witch hazel as long as I can buy it!</li>
            <li> Smells good me and my fiance LUV it thank u</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright, doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling as fresh and clean as alcohol-based toners but then again it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out, either.  Not sure if it&#x27;s doing much to enhance my complexion.  But it certainly isn&#x27;t hurting it!</li>
            <li> Nice product that removes any traces of makeup after cleansing. Like that it is alcohol free. Nice scent. Will repurchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used witch hazel as an astringent after Sea Breeze became harder to find locally.  However, I never liked the smell of pure witch hazel.  With a pleasant, but not overpowering lavender scent, I use Thayers every day.  This is a great product to add to any DE shaving routine as an inexpensive post shave toner.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for use as a diaper wipe solution. I love it. It smells good, which is pleasant when changing a poopy diaper. It also works well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my daughters skin, which is a MUST. I also used the cucumber scent, but it just made me hungry whenever I smelled it... not something I wish to associate with diaper changing. I not only would buy again, I have bought several times. Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> The lavender scent is relaxing and the witch hazel does what it is supposed to do. it tones and moisturizes the skin without alcohol ingredients. I use this after every shave and sometimes throughout the day to freshen up.</li>
            <li> I use this once or twice a day.  doesn&#x27;t sting, doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky and it works!  i refuse to live without it.</li>
            <li> It is great. Who would have thought that the witch hazel in the stores is mostly alcohol? Seriously? Drying alcohol on my face?! No, thanks. I love that this product is natural and does just what it says. Imagine that. Honesty in advertising. That&#x27;s something you don&#x27;t see much lately.</li>
            <li> Received the product quickly.  Have been using for past several days - once in morning, once at night.  While you can feel that somethings on your face, it&#x27;s not a bad sticky or yucky feel to it.  My skin does look more even and pores are not quite as noticeable as before.  Smell of toner is not strong and disappears really quickly.</li>
            <li> I used to use Avalon Organic&#x27;s lavender toner.  I was a fan of the product line for a decade.  Then they went and ruined it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a while to find a replacement, but Thayer&#x27;s is worth the effort.  The product has a light, pleasant scent; it goes on velvety-smooth; it works as a toner and a mid-day cleanser; it feels wonderful on my skin and my skin feels wonderful with it on.  I use it in the morning before serums and moisturizer; at night I use it as a quick cleanser after makeup removal, with a bit of rose hip seed oil and sweet almond oil for night-time care and repair.  It&#x27;s helped tremendously.  My super-sensitive skin feels better immediately, and retains the calm clean feeling well into the day.</li>
            <li> Everything that I wanted - quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I have loved Thayer Witch Hazel for years and now love the lavender fragrance......</li>
            <li> Fantastic organic product!!!! Cleaner and healthier skin! Yay!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I bought it for my &amp;#34;padsicles&amp;#34; for postpartum help. The left over toner in the bottle is used on my face and works great! Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin in the slightest bit and I notice a drastic difference in the tightness of my pores! I am one happy camper!</li>
            <li> smells great. i like the kinda old school packaging and like to keep it on my vanity, but it feels great straight from the fridge nice and cold on insect bites or sunburn!!</li>
            <li> Really like this item!</li>
            <li> Never buy drug store Witch Hazel again! You don&#x27;t want to rub alcohol on your skin. This stuff is great for removing make up at the end of the day and the lavender is so soothing. Great toner!</li>
            <li> I have been buying this for years. It&#x27;s surprisingly moisturizing, so I use it as such. I also treat blemishes with it. It smells so good and cools the skin. Underrated product.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this toner...I use this in the morning after I wash my face and at night also.  I then use my moisturizer on top and so far it seems like everything is fine.  I haven&#x27;t had any break outs.  The aloe is a nice touch.  Worth the price and you get a large bottle</li>
            <li> I use this every few days after washing my face at night. I use moisturizer afterward, but the thing I love about this version is that there is no drying alcohol. The scent is nice and clean/soothing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for Thayers Witch Hazel for years and had had never tried the lavender version. I really like it.</li>
            <li> I use to purchase this elsewhere years ago but couldn&#x27;t find it anymore.  Then I found it on Amazon (YAY!)  I always used these toners in the summer.  They come in different fragrances: Rose, Cucumber, Lemon, Peach, etc.  I have only ever purchased the Lavender and Rose ones, but I&#x27;m definitely going to start purchasing some of the others.</li>
            <li> I read reviews cons &amp; pros and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for about 10 days and noticed the blemish brightened and my face looks more clear!&lt;br /&gt;My skin is sensitive and combination but this product doesn&#x27;t irritate my face at all.&lt;br /&gt;It is big bottle, bigger than I thought. Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I use it for so many different things. It&#x27;s a cleanser, moisturizer and aftershave for my legs. Very soothing and calming. Smells fantastic too</li>
            <li> I am a recent convert to wetshaving (both with a DE and a SR) and have added this as an aftershave.  Excellent product and I will be buyng more when needed.</li>
            <li> Love the product and the smell! I used it for making a homemade, non-toxic, bug repellant that works great! Happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> If you make homemade wipes this is a must. This scent or rose works well.</li>
            <li> a little burning if you apply it after you deep clean your face (for example if you robbed your face with cleanser which contains tiny little exfoliating beads in it, or if you used facial brush, etc). but good for usual daily use. just be careful. for a gentler formula, try rose petal.&lt;br /&gt;delivered fast, carefully packed. will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is such a refreshing way to perk up your skin throughout the day or remove make-up. The lavender fragrance is light and very pleasant. This is a very nice product, I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I really like the product, but don&#x27;t love the scent. I typically love the smell of lavender, but this has more of a perfumey floral scent than a true lavender smell. I will purchase the rose (which does smell true to rose) next time.</li>
            <li> I really love this product! Smells great and my face feels refreshed after using it! It has the best ingredients!</li>
            <li> After having some time to use this witch hazel, I&#x27;m giving it my review. I have psoriasis and my skin can get pretty inflamed and itches like crazy! I pour a little witch hazel on a cotton ball and rub it into the problem areas. It instantly soothes my skin and relieves the itching! I&#x27;ve used it all over with great results. I will definitely be buying more when I run out. :)</li>
            <li> Nice relaxing smell. I use it on my face before bed.</li>
            <li> Good toner doesn&#x27;t have to be expensive. This one is the best for me and it is cheap. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a toner without alcohol, and I am smitten with this one.&lt;br /&gt;I use it twice a day and have been for weeks. There&#x27;s no drying effects, but it cleanses just as powerfully as stronger toners I&#x27;ve used. Even after I remove my makeup, its still taking crud out of my pores.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is light, but refreshing. Not over-powering in the least.&lt;br /&gt;I think I may try their rose scent next!</li>
            <li> Happy with the product and quick shipment from the seller. I&#x27;ve used it to take off makeup that my cleanser misses and after shaving to prevent razor burns. My husband used it after getting razor burn, as well, and it helped with the itchiness without an overwhelming smell.</li>
            <li> No issues. Everything acceptable.</li>
            <li> Shopping was quick, but when I received my package, it was leaking out the package. My toner was broken from the top lid and there was a whole in the seal.</li>
            <li> I have used this product numerous times and it is a nice, gentle toner.  The lavender scent is not overwhelming and doesn&#x27;t last a long time once the toner is applied.  This was my first time to use witch hazel but I&#x27;m glad that I chose an alcohol-free version because it doesn&#x27;t irritate or overly dry my skin.</li>
            <li> I always like this product. It is soothing and healing with a pleasant  fragrance.</li>
            <li> product is just as described. I use it as a facial toner each night and to mix in with essential oils for room sprays. Works very well!</li>
            <li> This product is a good toner with a fair price. Everything is good since it does what a toner needs to be. However, the cap was broken after several days when I opened it as usual. But, I still decided to keep it since itself is working good on my face and body~</li>
            <li> Greatest toner I have ever used! They pick up and clean my pores so well. When I use this, I notice that my face doesn&#x27;t get oily anymore!!! What I love also is how it doesn&#x27;t sting my skin when I&#x27;m applying it with a cotton pad because it&#x27;s alcohol free. I also use it as a face mister to hydrate my skin by diluting it with water in a small spray bottle I carry around.  I&#x27;m glad I tried this &amp; will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite toner. The rose one is great as well. Very gentle on my skin but still leaves a clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Makes a great facial toner at a fraction of the price of name brand ones.  Totally Non Irritating.</li>
            <li> This is like gods urine. I had recently picked up a job working as a mechanic, i work with alot of chemicals and grease which dried out my skin or made me breakout from dirtying my pores so i got this stuff, it keeps your skin clear and protected from dirt it also reduces the appearance of acnes redness and inflammation cause it is an astringent. So far no new breakouts have appeared and it keeps my skin moisturized and it leaves such a relieving clean feeling! Anotber plus is the smell which is fantastic!!! Its also a toner so it will even out your skin tone, basically its nothing but goodness for your face!</li>
            <li> Great product. I use as an aftershave when I know I did it poorly and regular aftershave is going to hurt a lot.(I could scrap all my skin off with a razor and this still wouldn&#x27;t burn)&lt;br /&gt;Lavender aroma falls away in 5mins. Which is why I misused 1 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: 07-29-2013&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Thayers brand (lavender as well as other thayers) exclusively for over 6months. My skin is noticeably more hydrated. (use organic face wash / Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream / Thayers --exclusively with my DE/Straight razor shaving.)</li>
            <li> If you have your head, you need to buy this.  Period.  Great for all skin types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave my head and face daily because: 1.) I enjoy shaving, and consider it more of a hobby than a chore, and 2.) I enjoy having a smooth head, and preferably one with without any irritation.  About twice a year, during Allergy flare ups, I tend to get bad irritated skin, and bumps after shaving, though they are not razor bumps.  It&#x27;s a pain, and deeply bothers me to the point where I either can&#x27;t shave, or have to shave with the grain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy nice products for shaving: Proraso (New Formula- Green Tube), Shave Secret, and have tried several after shaves.  I originally bought Dickinsons, and found it to be amazing- it helped cleared up my bumps nicely, though the alcohol agitated my bumps to an extent, not allowing them to heal as fast as they should.  I went to a whole foods store and bought the Lavender variety because it smells great, contains Glycerin and Aloe, and also does not have alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extra ingredients helps the skin heal nicely, and doesn&#x27;t dry out, causing the bumps to fade away a lot faster.  I would give the Dickinson a B+, whereas this stuff gets a resounding A.  Compared to other after shaves such as Anthony Logistics After Shave Balm, this stuff beats it by a mile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many products, but no after shave can beat this.  You do not need alcohol in your aftershave- only Witch Hazel, Aloe, and Glycerin.  For this price, it&#x27;s a no brainer.  It&#x27;s a large bottle that will laster a decade longer than the more expensive Art of Shaving products.</li>
            <li> Fast service - great product ... just as advertised.  A bit pricey but nice lotion - great aftershave.  Leaves my skin feeling soft and refreshed - no alcohol.  Just wish the lavender sent was a bit stronger and longer lasting.</li>
            <li> Using witch hazel after a shave is an important part of my shaving routine. I have found it soothing in the event of razor burn and seems to minimize shaving issues for me. The biggest problem I have had with using witch hazel is that I am not a fan of the earthy scent in any way. This has none of that strong earthy smell and the lavender scent in this Thayer&#x27;s is simply wonderful. Not too strong and not too feminine. This is my favorite Thayer&#x27;s product and I will be keeping this in my routine for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> Where have you been all my life??</li>
            <li> Lovely product. Fresh. As described...gentle, alcohol free, the aloe vera is a nice addition as is the Vitamin E. I bought it for me but my family has discovered it and they love it too! Hey, who has my bottle of Rose petal witch hazel!</li>
            <li> As an avid follower of beauty and makeup trends, I always spend money on the best designer products and name brands from Sephora. I worked at Teen Vogue and learned about Witch Hazel&#x27;s natural anti-inflammatory properties, so decided to give this a try. It&#x27;s nothing like the clinique one that burns a little - this is very soothing and smells incredible. Apply with a cotton round twice a day after washing your face and you will literally never get pimples. The toner shrinks your pores so after washing and exfoliating, close them up while they&#x27;re still clean with this toner. It&#x27;s the best and I swear by it!</li>
            <li> It is ok, acceptable ...</li>
            <li> This toner is so calming and refreshing.  I use it to cleanse my face first thing in the morning, before moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Great splash on astringent for post-shave. It smells pleasant and makes you feel clean. Also, it&#x27;s entirely made in the USA if that maters to you.</li>
            <li> I use this if something starts bleeding, and the bleeding quickly stops! Helps wounds heal faster and neater. I like the smell, but oddly I always have weird dreams if I apply this near my nose at night (I used it for a while around my nose area hoping it would shrink my pores). It does help the appearance of pores in the short-term, but eventually the effect seems to sort of wear off. I don&#x27;t use it around my nose anymore and just save it for the occasional popped pimple therapy. If you need your pores to look better for something the next day, I&#x27;d use it the night before, though. It would probably be good to use the night before getting close-up photos taken.</li>
            <li> When I received my package, I opened it and found there is no protective materials in the box!! The bottle cap is broken and some of the liquids has come out!! so terrible.</li>
            <li> Really like it. Very refreshing on a hot day. Haven&#x27;t seen any great improvements in my skin or any miracles but it feels nice.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent toner. It has a soft lavender scent, not too strong. It works great after a shave to tone the skin.</li>
            <li> Understated lavender scent and beautiful performance; just what you expect from Thayer&#x27;s!!</li>
            <li> Love these toners, I&#x27;m on my third bottle and my skin has never been better!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this toner is so soothing and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  It smells great and my skin feels clean after using it.  I took the advice of another reviewer and also used the toner to clean my makeup brushes - and my brushes are as good as new!  I think this toner is my new obsession!</li>
            <li> Its good. Works wonderfully, but I still prefer the rose over the lavender.</li>
            <li> After trying to use more natural products on my face, I was in search for a great toner for my sensitive skin.  I started using apple cider vinegar that I diluted.  It worked well on my face, but it smelled HORRIBLE!  My husband said he could smell it all the way downstairs when I was in the upstairs bathroom.  I had to find something else!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did some research and found Thayer&#x27;s alcohol free witch hazel products.  I will never go back.  My skin has never looked better, it smells great, it doesn&#x27;t sting my face, and I can use it straight from the bottle.  I will buy this again and try the other scents.  Thank you for the great product.</li>
            <li> I love this product! All the benefits of a toner without the sting of the alcohol. The scent is very nice and light - not overpowering. I will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I use the refreshing cucumber in the a.m. and the lavender before bed.  Great product, gentle on skin, subtle, natural fragrance - and no alcohol.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Alcohol free toner is the best.</li>
            <li> Nice and refreshing to use. Isn&#x27;t loaded up with anything artificial and has a very light lavender scent, but not so much that it can&#x27;t be used by men as an aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I really like this toner! It does not sting, burn and/or dry out the skin as it has no alcohol. It also does a great job of removing any extra dirt or oil that you may have on your face after washing. The lavender scent is not very strong, but that does not concern me. It serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> Works very well to balance the skin and remove make up residue left by cleansers. It doesn&#x27;t over dry the skin.</li>
            <li> The smell of the lavender fragrance used in this smells similar to cheap lavender soap and it is very vile.  I tried using it a few times more hoping the fragrance would \\&quot;grow\\&quot; on me, but that didn&#x27;t help.  I didn&#x27;t use this long enough to determine if it made a difference on my skin.  I subsequently purchased the Thayers rose scented version and that scent is much better.  I hope that Thayers stops using artificial fragrances.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an astringent without alcohol, and was a little concerned about the fragrance, but it is very light and pleasant. I tend towards sandlewood and similar after shave balms. This astringent/toner does not overpower. The bottle may last me a year of every day use.</li>
            <li> I love that this is alcohol free because it saves my skin.  The lavender scent is very mild and only noticeable when applying, and doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without my Thayer&#x27;s witch hazel!  I use it every single day as a refreshing facial toner.  I also used it to make frozen post partum pads for after I had my baby.  The scents are very beautiful and clean, nothing artificial-smelling.  I&#x27;ve used the lavender, rose and peach, and they are all great!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like lavender.</li>
            <li> Love this toner, leaves skin smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li> Works as intended and advertised</li>
            <li> I bought 2 different toners already and i don&#x27;t feel fresh after using it. My skin a little sticky after this one.. Or even not sticky.. I feel like something left on my skin.. especially on my forehead . and i want to get rid of it..  I don&#x27;t know why. I have normal skin ..</li>
            <li> I like this toner, It&#x27;s alcohol free and the lavender is really soothing. My only complaint is that I switched from a toner that also had rose in it as well as lavender that I loved so much, but was too costly. This is a really good compromise for price and it does have cleansing as well as a moisturizing effect so you can use this if you&#x27;re in a big rush and don&#x27;t have time for a full routine. But I wouldn&#x27;t make a habit out of it because it&#x27;s not really meant for cleaning. Great for irritated skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, To get the benefits of rose I was missing out on with this toner, I started using Badger Damascus Rose beauty balm with it and that combo has really healed my combo/acne prone skin. Hardly ever get breakouts anymore and when I do they heal quick!</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and in great condition.  Exactly as expected.  Also,  I love this product. It has quickly become my favorite part of my skincare routine. The lavender witch hazel is so soothing and feels great on the skin.</li>
            <li> i like a item.&lt;br /&gt;good.</li>
            <li> When I received my package, I opened it and found the bottle cap is broken and some of the liquids has come out!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended! I typically use rose water for an all-natural toner, but when I came across this lavender witch hazel toner I had to try it. LOVE the scent. Love it. I also love that It&#x27;s gentle and non-drying.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t wash my face with a cleanser in the morning...after all, having cleansed it thoroughly the night before, the only thing on my face in the morning is a little oil. So I use an alcohol-free toner on a cotton pad to &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; my face in the morning, before my serum and day lotion. This toner is PERFECT for that, and I also use it at night after cleansing to take off the last traces of makeup.</li>
            <li> Never have I been so happy with my complexion.Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel Toner is a miracle worker and it smells lovely.</li>
            <li> I use this as an aftershave. It works well, smells good, seems to help prevent razor burn and sooth the slightly raw skin I get from shaving. Doesn&#x27;t taste too bad if you accidentally get some in your mouth, and one bottle goes a long way for me.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product!&lt;br /&gt;all natural&lt;br /&gt;moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;toning&lt;br /&gt;very light fragrance that doesn&#x27;t linger&lt;br /&gt;After only a week my skin is smoother and more supple, as well as more clear and even has more of a glow to it.&lt;br /&gt;I use this morning and at night,&lt;br /&gt;well worth the money and will continue to buy for a long time to come!</li>
            <li> Great... Just as described.</li>
            <li> I love this because it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. It removes makeup residue wonderfully, I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> My face feels wonderful when I use this toner after washing my face.  It&#x27;s wonderful to find something that is so nice for the skin and affordable too.</li>
            <li> I have used witch hazel astringent as a facial toner for years.  By far, Thayer&#x27;s Lavender is my favorite.  It is refreshing and it seems to balance my skin&#x27;s combination zones.  Slightly more expensive, it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Staple of my beauty routine when combined with essential oils, in a spray bottle. My skin has never been better. highly recommend getting a spray bottle and using this as a facial moisturizer after the shower.</li>
            <li> Great smell, great for the skin. Personally I use it directly after shaving (face and head), and then I follow it up with some aftershave.  Overall it soothes the skin and moisturizes as expected.</li>
            <li> I have skin that is very difficult to manage: sensitive, break out prone, dry AND oily. About 3 years ago, I changed all my skin care products alcohol and soap free.&lt;br /&gt;My friend recommended this product to me and now I am in love. My face is much more smooth and just happier. It smells GREAT. I even stopped using moisturizers. I just wash my face and apply this toner and let it air dry. It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> I finally am using the product and my face is smoother and clearer than ever...</li>
            <li> Classic witch hazel good for applying to pimples etc. alas, this lavender doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the peach scent</li>
            <li> this is the 3rd time i have ordered from this seller and everything comes packaged and sealed securely. no leaks yet (knock on wood!) the price is fair for such a great product and one that is such a huge part of my &amp;#34;beauty routine.&amp;#34; i plan to continue purchasing as needed. thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this toner. Most others irritate my sensitive skin. My skin doesn&#x27;t get irritated at all with this. It thoroughly cleans any residue left from washing and leaves a blank canvas ready to absorb my serum and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> OK....witch hazel is a simple, ages-old product that does a great job, all by itself.........NO NEED to have it all &#x27;gussied up&#x27; with those added ingredients!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just look for standard, USP witch hazel instead, and save your money!!</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and this toner does not seem to help much. It rather makes my skin oily. But I use it with tea tree oil and that seems to help.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the rose version of this toner on and off for years. It&#x27;s relatively cheap and easy to find. However, although the rose scent is good, it&#x27;s a bit overwhelmingly floral and poofy. Not in an artificial way, but just a bit odd when compared to the rest of my regimen. I saw the lavender version online and knew I had to try it - I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere in stores. I guess I know why it&#x27;s not stocked at stores now. I&#x27;m actually surprised that I don&#x27;t see more reviews on the scent of the lavender version. I love lavender, and use the essential oil and lavender scents for many things. But I would never be able to tell that this is supposed to be lavender in the least. It smells kind of like baby shampoo, if I had to place it - almost soapy, although there is no soap in it of course. I could see it being a potential alternative for a man who wanted to get away from the overly floral scent, but I don&#x27;t know otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face is really crazy and I had to stop using any kind of cleanser earlier this year and just start toners instead to wipe down in the morning and evening, so it&#x27;s hard to say that there&#x27;s much difference between the scents that I&#x27;ve tried (rose and lavender). I do like that neither have alcohol (most witch hazel toners have hidden alcohol). I like the way it makes my face feel, although the rose is better in this regard. Maybe I just can&#x27;t get past the \\&quot;lavender\\&quot; smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a REAL lavender smell, try [ASIN:B0084TIFAQ The Homestead Company Alcohol Free Witch Hazel PM, (Lavender/Chamomile) Plus 100 Facial Cleansing, Cotton Pads (Bundle)]]. It is more expensive since it&#x27;s smaller, but I liked it a lot.</li>
            <li> The container lid leaks. I hadn&#x27;t even opened it yet and everything leaked out of the seal on the lid. Boo. I was really looking forward to using this stuff.</li>
            <li> I stopped using this product for a weak and my skin broke out. Always have to have it in the cabinet!</li>
            <li> I used the rose formula and I was impressed so I tried this one but I started to break out ugh! Sorry I have to give you 2 stars.</li>
            <li> Love it! Gentle on the skin</li>
            <li> I use this instead of face cream. This product keeps my face from drying out.</li>
            <li> The product has a wonderful light fragrance and is gently yet effective.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Like witch hazel.  Had no idea that it came in different scents.  Love the lavender!</li>
            <li> My favorite new toiletry find! Use as a toner after a shower &amp; as a quick facial cleanse before bed, love the scent.. Refreshing! And my skin has been more &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; than ever! Will also use on skin after shaving, it rids razor bumps quickly!</li>
            <li> A very nice, mild toner -- I use this after I&#x27;ve cleansed my face with a Konjac sponge. After using the toner I use either Vitamin C or Hyaluronic Acid (depending on if it&#x27;s AM or PM), followed by sunscreen. Thayer&#x27;s toner is an essential step in my skincare regimen. I prefer the Lavender to their Rose one, it&#x27;s all a matter of preference.</li>
            <li> Great product for my type of skin.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product!&lt;br /&gt;all natural&lt;br /&gt;moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;toning&lt;br /&gt;very light fragrance that doesn&#x27;t linger&lt;br /&gt;After only a week my skin is smoother and more supple, as well as more clear and even has more of a glow to it.&lt;br /&gt;I use this morning and at night,&lt;br /&gt;well worth the money and will continue to buy for a long time to come!</li>
            <li> Smells soapier than I would have thought but like all of Thayer&#x27;s witch hazel products, works great as a toner</li>
            <li> I use Thayers after removing my make-up and washing my face to make sure my face is clean and my pores are clear. It&#x27;s a natural, fresh product and I have been using it for many years. I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this Lavender Smell! But is it different than the Rose-Thayers Witch Hazel (non-alcoholic) I normally get? Not sure yet since I just barely got it. But so far so good! Although if in a month or two it doesn&#x27;t give me that same wonderful, fresh-cooling feeling, or worse yet, causes enlarged pores, a breakout or horrible allergic reaction! — I will  definitely update my review immediately, so it doesn&#x27;t happen to anyone else! But we&#x27;ll just have to wait &amp; see!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For potential First-timers, Thayers Witch-Hazel, is an all-around great product to have around the house! It does exactly what it says: cleanse, soften, refreshes and moisturizes — Anyone can use it!!! I seriously love this stuff! BUT, If you&#x27;re hoping to get some miracle life-changing product here...then let me save you some time and tell u to look elsewhere. Because remember, we&#x27;re only talking about Toner here. And I doubt you&#x27;ll get those kinds of changes with any Toner out there. So you might as well buy this one to save some $$$ for the other products that actually do. I personally, do notice and feel the subtle yet appreciative changes Thayers Witch Hazel does for my face in the morning before make-up and afterwards before I sleep. Definitely part is staying part of daily routine until there can be no more. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHIPMENT REVIEW: My bottle came in its standard packaging (a generic ziplock bag fit for its size). Until I twisted off the top to break the seal, the seal felt somewhat damped already, which made me suspect if this product had already been slightly used or tampered with. My finger was already tugging on the seal too-late to stop myself to question/return the product though. Although I am a repeat buyer this is the FIRST time this has happened and only so far. Could be a heat/packaging-issue hence the ziplock bag it comes in? I don&#x27;t know but this is just regarding the shipping.</li>
            <li> This is quickly becoming a favorite in my household.  Both my teenage son and daughter use it regularly.  I too have added it to my morning and nighttime routine.  Also great for after shaving legs, but before massaging in lotion.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  It is soothing, not drying, and smells great yet natural and not too perfumey!</li>
            <li> Just started using this but it smells amazing and isn&#x27;t too strong for my overly sensitive skin. If it works well, I&#x27;ll be a fan forever.</li>
            <li> Doing the job! Soothing my sensitive skin and very hydrating. Love the smell of it.</li>
            <li> I gave this a 5 star for the price, smell ,and performance.  I use it at night after my face wash to ensure I hydrate my face during the winter at night.  The dry heat from the house radiators so it&#x27;s important to have a good product like this as a toner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the rose toner for much longer time, and after trying this one out, I decided to go back to the rose one because it suits my skin better. I have combination to oily skin, and the rose one is soothing and balancing. I just didn&#x27;t feel the same with this one.</li>
            <li> This is really a great product!  Very soothing and can be used as a fast take off of makeup when I don&#x27;t have much time!</li>
            <li> Good product, I use it to keep face moistured everyday and it worked out well.</li>
            <li> With sensitive skin, this product responds perfectly! Great and good smell. I will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> It came fast. I like the scent of toner</li>
            <li> A miracle worker for my skin. Leaves my skin soft to the touch, it also removes bllemishes from my skin, leaving an even tone. I would definitely buy this product over and over again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with acne for a very long time. I&#x27;ve been using this on my back ,face, chest, you name it - after my evening showers (when my pores are open) and it&#x27;s been fantastic. No rash, irritation or odd after-scent or &amp;#34;dead skin / white flaky alcohol&amp;#34; residue. I was a huge skeptic of Witch Hazel and even barrated people who recommended it. Now, I&#x27;m the annoying guy telling everyone I know about it!</li>
            <li> Usually, I go towards the rose scent, but this time I opted for the lavender. I am glad I did. I like the light scent of this variety better. I have been using Thayer&#x27;s for 2 years and i have sensitive, finicky skin. At the end of the day this is the best thing you could use on your face! I cleanse afterwards with my gently cleanser and then moisturize.</li>
            <li> At first, all I could find was the Witch Hazel w/alcohol ... this dried my skin. I liked the flawless look but I could tell it was dry.  I was happy to find an alcohol free version of the witch hazel and I love the rose scent.  Its very nice .... I use this daily and I love the look and feel of my skin.  Only problem, if I don&#x27;t use it for a week, I get pimples.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great toner! Fast shipping. Highly recommend seller. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toner for 2+years now and I love it.  It lasts forever and I have noticed major improvement in pore size.  I am pretty disciplined with my skin- regimen and use it twice a day everyday in combination with balm balm&#x27;s coconut cleanser and moisturizer.  While other toners tend to dry out my skin, this one actually moisturizes and brightens.  It doesn&#x27;t give that tingly sensation so many people like, but I can say that this stuff actually works.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toner! It smells great and feels wonderful on your skin. I use it as part of my morning &amp; nighttime routines. There&#x27;s no alcohol so it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin at all. I use it after cleansing and before the application of any serums.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It removes left over dirt &amp; makeup that my face wash misses. And to top it off it leaves my face feeling soft &amp; smooth. And it smells lovely!</li>
            <li> Product was fine but came with lid half off leaking all over other items purchased. Not happy with that aspect</li>
            <li> love all the Thayers Witch Hazels!! great toner &amp; face refresher :)</li>
            <li> I am sure it will fit perfectly to my needs. I am really very exited to use it, yay and happy</li>
            <li> I like this product. It&#x27;s nice enough in that it is alcohol free witch hazel. But it also has a very good scent of lavender. The scent is not heavy or overpowering. The product came on time and was precisely what I ordered.  I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Great product, great seller!</li>
            <li> This is the best toner I&#x27;ve ever used, and plan to continue using it for as long as I can. It doesn&#x27;t contain any alcohol, smells great, really clears out extra gunk from your skin, and softens it as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great;it&#x27;s gentle and I really like it! I&#x27;ll purchase it again. The only draw back is that it smells like the soap product we used to blow bubbles when I was a child.... I&#x27;d prefer that it  smell like lavender or have no fragrance whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000PP15L8 Thayers Alcohol-Free Lavender Witch Hazel Toner - 12 oz]]</li>
            <li> Love This product, have a very though beard and sensitive skin.  This product definitely helps with the irritation of shaving!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin as smells very nice. I apply it with a washcloth in the mornings and my skin doesn&#x27;t get oily during the day.</li>
            <li> This stuff works good and really calms red irritated skin. Fast shipping and good packaging!</li>
            <li> shipped quickly; helping to reduce redness on my face without drying</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural toner and was going to buy plain witch hazel but am not a giant fan of the scent of it so I was very happy to see this offered with lavender scent. Have used it all week and it feels very nice on the skin, cleanses well, and is refreshing. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this witch hazel, and so far it isn&#x27;t making my face break out, like witch hazel with alcohol does.</li>
            <li> Great toner, does wonders for my skin!</li>
            <li> I am all for natural &amp; organic &amp; this product fits the bill!  Very gentle on the skin &amp; it also smells great!.  The added Vitamin E &amp; Aloe Vera are an added bonus, plus it&#x27;s good for your skin &amp; will not sting or irritate. It&#x27;s great for every skin type.  I definitely recommend this for everyone!</li>
