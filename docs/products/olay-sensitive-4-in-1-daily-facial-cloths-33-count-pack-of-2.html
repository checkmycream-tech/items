            <li>and it does a good job of cleansing the face gently.</li>
            <li>I was happy to see that they were fragrance free because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This is so easy to get rid of your foundation and wash your face off.</li>
            <li>So easy to use</li>
            <li>Remove makeup easily and provide some exfoliate benefit as well.</li>
            <li>They are so easy, you just run them under water and rub them together to activate the soap, and then cleanse.</li>
            <li>I wear extended-wear foundation and that stuff doesn&#x27;t come off easily, but these cloths have no problem with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Easily packable.</li>

            <li>Great for travel - I constantly forget to pack face wash</li>
            <li>I got these free when a drug store was giving away Olympic sets with purchases.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe my luck in getting such a great price as I did.  </li>
            <li>Light.</li>
            <li>I have used these facial cloths for years, and they are great for my skin.</li>
            <li>The facial cloths arrived in great condition.  </li>
            <li>Seems to do a great job at removing eye makeup, and all in all works better than wet makeup remover wipes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They feel like cloth, soft, and are a good size.  </li>
            <li>and I never had totally clean skin.</li>
            <li>They leave my face feeling, and looking, clean while retaining moisture in the skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to travel light, no extra bottles to tote around.</li>
            <li>and they bubble and clean, but</li>
            <li>I felt like it didn&#x27;t really clean my face</li>
            <li>: They leave your face feeling squeaky clean without being too harsh.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>They are also great for those who love to travel--one less liquid item to worry about!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to worry about taking special soaps or cleansers with me.</li>
            <li>They are just what I had meant to order and the fact that there were two boxes instead of 1 made the order really special.  </li>
            <li>When I saw Amazon had them as a subscribe and save option I signed up right away!</li>
            <li>Good for removing make up and are sanitary since each cloth can only be used once.</li>
            <li>They all did an adequate job, but I never felt like my face was really clean.  </li>
            <li>My skin face feels so clean and fresh after using this.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find these in the local stores any more - so getting them online and on the subscription is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Amazon shipped this out to me SUPER fast!!</li>
            <li>$8 for 66 sheets is already pretty good, but I cut each sheet in quarters and use it as part of both my my morning and evening routine, and have enough for over 4 months.</li>
            <li>Once you add water, the clothes easily remove make up and dirt gently with olay cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I love these cloths, especially for travel, because they&#x27;re easy to pack and use.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel tight or anything a great product.</li>
            <li>It is good i bought 4 units of 33 each one, but it wasn&#x27;t what i expected, i wanted to try something new but the expenses of shipping and taxes were more than i would pay for it again.</li>
            <li>You just add a little water and move around with your hands to lather it up then wash your face with it then after I find it better to rinse it out and use warm water with the cloth and wash the soap off face then</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are great to use for travelling too - I can pack a few in a ziplock bag, and have them with me when needed.</li>
            <li>I love how it foams, and love how its not too rough on the skin.</li>
            <li>I am using a fresh cloth every time I wash my face.</li>
            <li>Use them for your kids too when traveling-- sensitive formula is safe for them also.</li>
            <li>It is rare to find them in the store</li>
            <li>Maybe they don&#x27;t make the Sensitive Skin any more?  </li>
            <li>I love the convenience of ordering them through Amazon, because they are not always available in the local stores.</li>
            <li>they leave a fresh feeling.  </li>
            <li>The texture of the Sensitive variety of these facial cloths is better than the other varieties (in my opinion) and does a wonderful job of getting dirt and makeup off my face.  </li>
            <li>This product make my skin feel clean, soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>They are gentle enough for sensitive skin, which I have, but do a great job of cleaning off all make-up, including eye.  </li>
            <li>I love these clothes because they remove all of my makeup and leave my skin feeling fresh and clean without being over dry.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin they might be too strong for my skin lupus and rosacea.</li>
            <li>Nice to find it for such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>After using these , just 1 towelette , I run a clean cotton pad with just toner, and it is clean, no make up leftovers, plus it is so gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>These little cloths do a good job of removing mascara, too.</li>
            <li>My job can get me a little dirtier than I would like and this is a good way for me to wash my face during the day.</li>
            <li>Love these facial cloths</li>
            <li>I love these facial cloths.</li>
            <li>With these cloths I just wet them with warm water, wipe them all over my face, throw them away, and follow up with a damp washcloth to get rid of the remaining cleanser.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and soft, but your eyes would be irritated if you try to cleanse your eye make up.</li>
            <li>: These are my favorite facial cloths because they aren&#x27;t pre-moistened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love these facial cloths.  </li>
            <li>Have been using them for years and am happy that they are so easy to get on Amazon since my local store is usually out.</li>
            <li>These facial cloths are very effective at taking  make up off and also don&#x27;t irritate skin or leave it dry.</li>
            <li>they make your skin feel so clean and soft.</li>
            <li>and it makes my skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I use them in the morning and find that they work well for my sensitive skin -- non-drying, non-irritating and leave my skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li>I go out every night pretty much.</li>
            <li>I used the Neutrogena one for a long time and really satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>Then, once your face is clean, you run the cloth under water for a few seconds to remove the remainder of soak and most of the makeup, and wipe the soap off your face.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and these cleansing cloths do the trick.</li>
            <li>These facial cloths really remove makeup and they don&#x27;t have any strong perfumy smell.</li>
            <li>Thanks Olay</li>
            <li>Very convenient for travel, also.</li>
            <li>and he seems to really like them.</li>
            <li>this works very well to remove dirt and make up.</li>
            <li>I think they really do the job well.</li>
            <li>Works very well and is very convenient.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Mom.</li>
            <li>I liked them so much that they are now my only facial cleanser</li>
            <li>Add water when you&#x27;re ready to use them.</li>
            <li>Sudsy, gentle, thorough -</li>
            <li>Cleans my face very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fast way to wash your face and get all the make-up off.  </li>
            <li>Very timely delivery with no problems.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>They lather up nicely and help exfoliate without being harsh.</li>
            <li>I had hoped for something I could clean on the go, without making a big production and needing a towel.</li>
            <li>They clean waterproof sunscreen, mascara and eyeliner without extra product intervention like eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>have worked for a dermatologist for many years, and these are the cloths we recommend, hands down.</li>
            <li>I really wanted something a little more substantial.</li>
            <li>so I often cut it in half :)</li>
            <li>I like these for travel because they are dry and clean my face very well after wetting the cloth.  </li>
            <li>Then, I tried the Olay daily facial cloths, and really love them.  </li>
            <li>My most recent order of this item resulted in receiving one (not three) package of the Gentle Cleaning cloths (not Sensitive Skin).  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these cloths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>so it saves me a little bit more money then going to a walgreens or CVS.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more sensitive/not as abrasive as using a wipe</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry out skin and leaves it feeling clean and polished</li>
            <li>Wow, two for 1, don&#x27;t find that much anymore.  </li>
            <li>Like many other people, my skin does not respond well to soap or many of the other facial cleansers and body washes on then market.  </li>
            <li>I use the sensitive formula and follow up with moisturizer and get frequent positive comments on my complexion/skin.</li>
            <li>I keep the packet in the shower and just wet one while showering and wipe my face clean.</li>
            <li>and I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>and I have very sensitive, combo skin.</li>
            <li>skin is very soft now too.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I had no problem with Neutrogena&#x27;s one, and I don&#x27;t think that my eyes are very sensitive..</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin fealing clean, never tight or dry.</li>
            <li>Even when my skin is irritated due to my eczema breakouts, this cloth is gentle enough to cleanse without causes major dryness and more irritation.  </li>
            <li>I first began using Olay facial cleansers for travel because they are so easy to  pack and take up so little space in my luggage.  </li>
            <li>They take the make up and any other residue off and leave your face feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I thought these were going to be the cloths you can use right out of the package, but they&#x27;re dry - not pre-moistened.</li>
            <li>I am a woman of a certain age and these facial clothes help keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li>What I can say is that these cleansing cloths seem to clear up my skin overnight.</li>
            <li>Just to be clear, these cloths do not exfoliate.</li>
            <li>However, I would break out completely if I didnt remove all my foundation and blush.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, so this does the trick, and it does not break me out at all.</li>
            <li>When I wake up in the morning, the blemish is completely gone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also teaching my daughter to wash her face with these since they are for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these cloths for years and years, and I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I do have some adult acne, and these cloths do not aggravate it.</li>
            <li>They get all my makeup off yet are gentle enough not to break me out</li>
            <li>I use it for complete skin care twice a day, can be use for all types of skin condition.</li>
            <li>if you have sensitive skin the product is for you</li>
            <li>another reviewer mentioned, they&#x27;re also a life-saver if you&#x27;re a frequent flyer.  </li>
            <li>The Olay Sensitive</li>
            <li>As someone with sensitive skin, I won&#x27;t take a chance with a knock-off product on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This wouldn&#x27;t be an issue at all except that it irked me because it&#x27;s something I&#x27;m putting on my face (sensitive skin) and don&#x27;t want it tampered with.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use these everyday, I tend to alternate my skin regime, but I do love these as: a &#x27;go to&#x27; when I don&#x27;t care to go through a three step process.</li>
            <li>They did a mediocre job of cleaning, but not as good as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li>and I get clean without making a mess of the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>overpowering scent, doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes, doesn&#x27;t make a mess, gets my skin clean.  </li>
            <li>They clean my face and don&#x27;t leave my skin feeling tight or itchy  the way some cleansers or soaps do.  </li>
            <li>I actually rip one of these in half to use over two washings, as there is more than enough lather and square footage (inchage?)</li>
            <li>prefer wet cloths - if you like dry then they are fine</li>
            <li>Wet it with hot water and hold it directly by the eyes..</li>
            <li>These Sensitive 4-in-1 Daily Facial Cleansing Cloths work very well with my extremely sensitive skin which is prone to contact dermatitis (allergic rash and burning).  </li>
            <li>Normal daily cleaning and drying with a towel is all the exfoliating a person needs.  </li>
            <li>and they were just as big of a pain in the butt as using normal soap and a washcloth.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that I am using a new, sanitary clothe on my face each time, therefore alleviating any concern as to whether it has been sanitized well enough to impede the spread of bacteria, as there is with a fabric clothe.  </li>
            <li>I am a 21 year old female.</li>
            <li>I use these in the shower, just wet with water, rub the cloth to produce suds and you are ready to use it.</li>
            <li>But this is not a wet sheet and has to be soak before you use (by water.)</li>
            <li>I have rocesa and sensitive skin and can&#x27;t say enough about this product.</li>
            <li>My daughter has sensitive skin and these are one of the only products she can use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to pack because they are dry - ingredients activated when moistened with water and can even, if needed be used as a small wash cloth.</li>
            <li>I cut them in half because I&#x27;m a cheap bastard plus it took up half the space.</li>
            <li>They felt fine on the face and weren&#x27;t irritating but it discolored my skin something fierce.  </li>
            <li>As a flight attendant they take up little space in my toiletry bag.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know it is  good or bad</li>

            <li> So easy to use</li>
            <li> Remove makeup easily and provide some exfoliate benefit as well.</li>
            <li> They are so easy, you just run them under water and rub them together to activate the soap, and then cleanse.</li>
            <li> I wear extended-wear foundation and that stuff doesn&#x27;t come off easily, but these cloths have no problem with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Easily packable.</li>

            <li> Great for travel - I constantly forget to pack face wash</li>
            <li> I got these free when a drug store was giving away Olympic sets with purchases.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe my luck in getting such a great price as I did.  </li>
            <li> Light.</li>
            <li> I have used these facial cloths for years, and they are great for my skin.</li>
            <li> The facial cloths arrived in great condition.  </li>
            <li> Seems to do a great job at removing eye makeup, and all in all works better than wet makeup remover wipes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They feel like cloth, soft, and are a good size.  </li>
            <li> and I never had totally clean skin.</li>
            <li> They leave my face feeling, and looking, clean while retaining moisture in the skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to travel light, no extra bottles to tote around.</li>
            <li> and they bubble and clean, but</li>
            <li> I felt like it didn&#x27;t really clean my face</li>
            <li> : They leave your face feeling squeaky clean without being too harsh.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> They are also great for those who love to travel--one less liquid item to worry about!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about taking special soaps or cleansers with me.</li>
            <li> They are just what I had meant to order and the fact that there were two boxes instead of 1 made the order really special.  </li>
            <li> When I saw Amazon had them as a subscribe and save option I signed up right away!</li>
            <li> Good for removing make up and are sanitary since each cloth can only be used once.</li>
            <li> They all did an adequate job, but I never felt like my face was really clean.  </li>
            <li> My skin face feels so clean and fresh after using this.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find these in the local stores any more - so getting them online and on the subscription is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Amazon shipped this out to me SUPER fast!!</li>
            <li> $8 for 66 sheets is already pretty good, but I cut each sheet in quarters and use it as part of both my my morning and evening routine, and have enough for over 4 months.</li>
            <li> Once you add water, the clothes easily remove make up and dirt gently with olay cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I love these cloths, especially for travel, because they&#x27;re easy to pack and use.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel tight or anything a great product.</li>
            <li> It is good i bought 4 units of 33 each one, but it wasn&#x27;t what i expected, i wanted to try something new but the expenses of shipping and taxes were more than i would pay for it again.</li>
            <li> You just add a little water and move around with your hands to lather it up then wash your face with it then after I find it better to rinse it out and use warm water with the cloth and wash the soap off face then</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are great to use for travelling too - I can pack a few in a ziplock bag, and have them with me when needed.</li>
            <li> I love how it foams, and love how its not too rough on the skin.</li>
            <li> I am using a fresh cloth every time I wash my face.</li>
            <li> Use them for your kids too when traveling-- sensitive formula is safe for them also.</li>
            <li> It is rare to find them in the store</li>
            <li> Maybe they don&#x27;t make the Sensitive Skin any more?  </li>
            <li> I love the convenience of ordering them through Amazon, because they are not always available in the local stores.</li>
            <li> they leave a fresh feeling.  </li>
            <li> The texture of the Sensitive variety of these facial cloths is better than the other varieties (in my opinion) and does a wonderful job of getting dirt and makeup off my face.  </li>
            <li> This product make my skin feel clean, soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> They are gentle enough for sensitive skin, which I have, but do a great job of cleaning off all make-up, including eye.  </li>
            <li> I love these clothes because they remove all of my makeup and leave my skin feeling fresh and clean without being over dry.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin they might be too strong for my skin lupus and rosacea.</li>
            <li> Nice to find it for such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> After using these , just 1 towelette , I run a clean cotton pad with just toner, and it is clean, no make up leftovers, plus it is so gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> These little cloths do a good job of removing mascara, too.</li>
            <li> My job can get me a little dirtier than I would like and this is a good way for me to wash my face during the day.</li>
            <li> Love these facial cloths</li>
            <li> I love these facial cloths.</li>
            <li> With these cloths I just wet them with warm water, wipe them all over my face, throw them away, and follow up with a damp washcloth to get rid of the remaining cleanser.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth and soft, but your eyes would be irritated if you try to cleanse your eye make up.</li>
            <li> : These are my favorite facial cloths because they aren&#x27;t pre-moistened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love these facial cloths.  </li>
            <li> Have been using them for years and am happy that they are so easy to get on Amazon since my local store is usually out.</li>
            <li> These facial cloths are very effective at taking  make up off and also don&#x27;t irritate skin or leave it dry.</li>
            <li> they make your skin feel so clean and soft.</li>
            <li> and it makes my skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I use them in the morning and find that they work well for my sensitive skin -- non-drying, non-irritating and leave my skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li> I go out every night pretty much.</li>
            <li> I used the Neutrogena one for a long time and really satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Then, once your face is clean, you run the cloth under water for a few seconds to remove the remainder of soak and most of the makeup, and wipe the soap off your face.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and these cleansing cloths do the trick.</li>
            <li> These facial cloths really remove makeup and they don&#x27;t have any strong perfumy smell.</li>
            <li> Thanks Olay</li>
            <li> Very convenient for travel, also.</li>

            <li> this works very well to remove dirt and make up.</li>
            <li> I think they really do the job well.</li>
            <li> Works very well and is very convenient.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Mom.</li>
            <li> I liked them so much that they are now my only facial cleanser</li>
            <li> Add water when you&#x27;re ready to use them.</li>
            <li> Sudsy, gentle, thorough -</li>
            <li> Cleans my face very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fast way to wash your face and get all the make-up off.  </li>
            <li> Very timely delivery with no problems.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> They lather up nicely and help exfoliate without being harsh.</li>
            <li> I had hoped for something I could clean on the go, without making a big production and needing a towel.</li>
            <li> They clean waterproof sunscreen, mascara and eyeliner without extra product intervention like eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> have worked for a dermatologist for many years, and these are the cloths we recommend, hands down.</li>
            <li> I really wanted something a little more substantial.</li>
            <li> so I often cut it in half :)</li>
            <li> I like these for travel because they are dry and clean my face very well after wetting the cloth.  </li>
            <li> Then, I tried the Olay daily facial cloths, and really love them.  </li>
            <li> My most recent order of this item resulted in receiving one (not three) package of the Gentle Cleaning cloths (not Sensitive Skin).  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these cloths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> so it saves me a little bit more money then going to a walgreens or CVS.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more sensitive/not as abrasive as using a wipe</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out skin and leaves it feeling clean and polished</li>
            <li> Wow, two for 1, don&#x27;t find that much anymore.  </li>
            <li> Like many other people, my skin does not respond well to soap or many of the other facial cleansers and body washes on then market.  </li>
            <li> I use the sensitive formula and follow up with moisturizer and get frequent positive comments on my complexion/skin.</li>
            <li> I keep the packet in the shower and just wet one while showering and wipe my face clean.</li>
            <li> and I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> and I have very sensitive, combo skin.</li>
            <li> skin is very soft now too.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I had no problem with Neutrogena&#x27;s one, and I don&#x27;t think that my eyes are very sensitive..</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin fealing clean, never tight or dry.</li>
            <li> Even when my skin is irritated due to my eczema breakouts, this cloth is gentle enough to cleanse without causes major dryness and more irritation.  </li>
            <li> I first began using Olay facial cleansers for travel because they are so easy to  pack and take up so little space in my luggage.  </li>
            <li> They take the make up and any other residue off and leave your face feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I thought these were going to be the cloths you can use right out of the package, but they&#x27;re dry - not pre-moistened.</li>
            <li> I am a woman of a certain age and these facial clothes help keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li> What I can say is that these cleansing cloths seem to clear up my skin overnight.</li>
            <li> Just to be clear, these cloths do not exfoliate.</li>
            <li> However, I would break out completely if I didnt remove all my foundation and blush.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so this does the trick, and it does not break me out at all.</li>
            <li> When I wake up in the morning, the blemish is completely gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also teaching my daughter to wash her face with these since they are for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these cloths for years and years, and I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I do have some adult acne, and these cloths do not aggravate it.</li>
            <li> They get all my makeup off yet are gentle enough not to break me out</li>
            <li> I use it for complete skin care twice a day, can be use for all types of skin condition.</li>
            <li> if you have sensitive skin the product is for you</li>
            <li> another reviewer mentioned, they&#x27;re also a life-saver if you&#x27;re a frequent flyer.  </li>
            <li> The Olay Sensitive</li>
            <li> As someone with sensitive skin, I won&#x27;t take a chance with a knock-off product on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This wouldn&#x27;t be an issue at all except that it irked me because it&#x27;s something I&#x27;m putting on my face (sensitive skin) and don&#x27;t want it tampered with.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use these everyday, I tend to alternate my skin regime, but I do love these as: a &#x27;go to&#x27; when I don&#x27;t care to go through a three step process.</li>
            <li> They did a mediocre job of cleaning, but not as good as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> and I get clean without making a mess of the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> overpowering scent, doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes, doesn&#x27;t make a mess, gets my skin clean.  </li>
            <li> They clean my face and don&#x27;t leave my skin feeling tight or itchy  the way some cleansers or soaps do.  </li>
            <li> I actually rip one of these in half to use over two washings, as there is more than enough lather and square footage (inchage?)</li>
            <li> prefer wet cloths - if you like dry then they are fine</li>
            <li> Wet it with hot water and hold it directly by the eyes..</li>
            <li> These Sensitive 4-in-1 Daily Facial Cleansing Cloths work very well with my extremely sensitive skin which is prone to contact dermatitis (allergic rash and burning).  </li>
            <li> Normal daily cleaning and drying with a towel is all the exfoliating a person needs.  </li>
            <li> and they were just as big of a pain in the butt as using normal soap and a washcloth.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that I am using a new, sanitary clothe on my face each time, therefore alleviating any concern as to whether it has been sanitized well enough to impede the spread of bacteria, as there is with a fabric clothe.  </li>
            <li> I am a 21 year old female.</li>
            <li> I use these in the shower, just wet with water, rub the cloth to produce suds and you are ready to use it.</li>
            <li> But this is not a wet sheet and has to be soak before you use (by water.)</li>
            <li> I have rocesa and sensitive skin and can&#x27;t say enough about this product.</li>
            <li> My daughter has sensitive skin and these are one of the only products she can use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to pack because they are dry - ingredients activated when moistened with water and can even, if needed be used as a small wash cloth.</li>
            <li> I cut them in half because I&#x27;m a cheap bastard plus it took up half the space.</li>
            <li> They felt fine on the face and weren&#x27;t irritating but it discolored my skin something fierce.  </li>
            <li> As a flight attendant they take up little space in my toiletry bag.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know it is  good or bad</li>
            <li> The Olay cleansing cloths clean without irritating your sking.</li>
            <li> and they last me twice as long.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re different than wipes in that the cloth is dry.  </li>
            <li> My face actually cleared up, they don&#x27;t dry out your skin and they remove makeup!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using wipes to remove makeup at night for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I actually cut them in half, so they last twice as long.</li>
            <li> Other brands of this type of facial cleansing clothe have been rough on my skin and left my face dry.  </li>
            <li> They have a very slight texture to provide some exfoliation and they leave your skin soft but not oily.</li>
            <li> When moistened the cloths remove all makeup - but you have to scrub a little on the eyes to remove mascara or heavy eyeliner, which I don&#x27;t use very often.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> This product is different with other make cleansing wipes.</li>
            <li> I suggest you also occasionally use Olay moisturizer if your face feels a little dry especially in winter</li>
            <li> Sensitive Skin facial wipes and have a hard time finding wipes that my skin can handle.</li>
            <li> pat dry.  </li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t dry out on you.</li>
            <li> I have been using the olay dry cloths for years now.</li>
            <li> so it can&#x27;t dry up.  </li>
            <li> and these do not irritate or overly dry my face at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years to wash my face (almost) every night and even though I&#x27;ve tried a few different brands, I keep coming back to these.  </li>
            <li> Am not sure why stores don&#x27;t seem to carry the sensitive ones any longer.  </li>
            <li> The cloths are so big that I cut them in half</li>
            <li> If washing at the sink, only half of the cloth is needed....</li>
            <li> The cloth is a little scrubby, which I like - enough to feel like you&#x27;re exfoliating your skin but not using sandpaper on it.</li>
            <li> You have to get them wet</li>
            <li> your face and hair etc are all wet</li>
            <li> No need to try and keep the package closed to keep them moist.</li>
            <li> I have to be careful with everything I put on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Gently but thoroughly removes makeup without irritating my skin.  </li>
            <li> I am really not sure how these are 4 in 1, it feels like regular soap to me....</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t anything wrong with these cloths as a whole.</li>
            <li> I am pretty  old, although I hate to admit it.</li>
            <li> So sensitive that I have actually broken out from Burts Bees</li>
            <li> I like soap and water for cleansing my face and these are an easy solution since I hate wet washcloths hanging around.</li>
            <li> addendum:  for those people that say these are too sudsy, add LESS water.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for less than a week.</li>
            <li> And less &amp;#34;liquid&amp;#34; to worry about when flying.</li>
            <li> They are a bit pricey -- ordering them on &amp;#34;subscribe and save&amp;#34; has previously helped, but now the pricing structure has changed and it looks like I will be paying more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it does a decent job of lathering and cleaning, but for the price and the 4 in 1 claims I am not impressed</li>
            <li> These are a little pricey</li>
            <li> Product was what I ordered; the boxes were a little bit torn/bent up though.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it every day but every few days</li>
            <li> These area a staple for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> The order arrives within a few days.</li>
            <li> I have quite a few allergies.  </li>
            <li> used to be pretty bad about washing my face every night, and the problem was</li>
            <li> There have been times when I&#x27;ve noticed a small emerging pimple as I&#x27;m washing my face before bed.</li>
            <li> No more leaking soapy bottles.</li>
            <li> but I see the price has risen by at least $5</li>
            <li> so maybe it just interacts poorly with these wipes.</li>
            <li> I have use these for years and was unable to find then in the stores.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> Then it&#x27;s bye bye and into the trash; the difficult job of trying to removing makeup from a fabric clothe does not exist.  </li>
            <li> They stopped carrying it which made me really sad bc</li>
            <li> It was difficult to find in stock thank goodness for AMAZON!</li>
            <li> Bad</li>
            <li> I hated splashing water on my face - it would just get everywhere.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I ended up throwing these away because they smelled awful.</li>
            <li> I have terrible skin.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These are the best for travelers - light weight and good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Perfect for make up removal including eye make up. Doesn&#x27;t dry out skin and leaves it feeling clean and polished</li>
            <li> These facial cloths are great. I don&#x27;t even need a speacial eye makeup remover. Does a great job and keeps my face cloths from getting stained with makeup.</li>
            <li> I am a 21 year old female. I go out every night pretty much. And when I get home I just wanna crash into bed with my makeup on. However, I would break out completely if I didnt remove all my foundation and blush. This is so easy to get rid of your foundation and wash your face off. I have sensitive skin, so this does the trick, and it does not break me out at all. I love it!!!!! I will repurchase this month after month. I love how it foams, and love how its not too rough on the skin. I get it in the pack of 2 - so it saves me a little bit more money then going to a walgreens or CVS. Amazon shipped this out to me SUPER fast!!</li>
            <li> I had to get rid of these.  They felt fine on the face and weren&#x27;t irritating but it discolored my skin something fierce.  Something in this that makes my skin look burnt.</li>
            <li> prefer wet cloths - if you like dry then they are fine</li>
            <li> I love these they are so great on my face and I have very sensitive skin.  You just add a little water and move around with your hands to lather it up then wash your face with it then after I find it better to rinse it out and use warm water with the cloth and wash the soap off face then pat dry.  I like to use these at the sink before or after my shower instead of in the shower just seems to feel better on my face that way.  These are a little pricey but I keep buying them now because they make my face feel so much better after using them.  I suggest you also occasionally use Olay moisturizer if your face feels a little dry especially in winter I don&#x27;t use it every day but every few days or so I use moisturizer after cleaning my face with the Olay wipes .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear much make-up, so I can&#x27;t comment on how good it is at removing. What I can say is that these cleansing cloths seem to clear up my skin overnight. There have been times when I&#x27;ve noticed a small emerging pimple as I&#x27;m washing my face before bed. When I wake up in the morning, the blemish is completely gone. Also, I run the cloth over and around my eyes with no irritation or stinging, which is nice.  The cloth is a little scrubby, which I like - enough to feel like you&#x27;re exfoliating your skin but not using sandpaper on it. I follow up using Olay&#x27;s Regenerating Serum and sometimes their vitamin moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love these facial cloths</li>
            <li> These are great, I use them all the time, plenty of cleaner and I like that I am using a fresh cloth every time I wash my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these facial cleansers for years.  They take the make up and any other residue off and leave your face feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li> This product make my skin feel clean, soft and smooth. Doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel tight or anything a great product. Thanks Olay</li>
            <li> Nice gentle cleansing and then throw it away.  So easy to use and it does a good job of cleansing the face gently.</li>
            <li> I love these cloths to remove mascara!  I&#x27;m also teaching my daughter to wash her face with these since they are for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have use these for years and was unable to find then in the stores.&lt;br /&gt;They are very good for anyone who has sensitive to soap.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find these in the local stores any more - so getting them online and on the subscription is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I have tried many products to remove my make up (foundation, powder  and I never had totally clean skin. After using these , just 1 towelette , I run a clean cotton pad with just toner, and it is clean, no make up leftovers, plus it is so gentle on my sensitive skin. I love it and will buy more.</li>
            <li> addendum:  for those people that say these are too sudsy, add LESS water.&lt;br /&gt;I have worked for a dermatologist for many years, and these are the cloths we recommend, hands down. They are gentle enough for sensitive skin, which I have, but do a great job of cleaning off all make-up, including eye.  You will not have to use an eye make-up remover at all.&lt;br /&gt;The fact that these do not exfoliate is all the better.  This is not indicated for anyone, and if you have acne, it will exacerbate it. Normal daily cleaning and drying with a towel is all the exfoliating a person needs.  I have used these cloths for probably 9 years, and people comment on how nice my skin looks all the time.&lt;br /&gt;If there were more than 5 stars, these would earn them.&lt;br /&gt;BTW, Hoda of the Today Show says she can never get the last bit of mascara off, and always has the remnants of it left on her pillow.  These are for you, Hoda!</li>
            <li> I have been using these for almost 10 years. I like soap and water for cleansing my face and these are an easy solution since I hate wet washcloths hanging around. I use the sensitive formula and follow up with moisturizer and get frequent positive comments on my complexion/skin. I am pretty  old, although I hate to admit it. These little cloths do a good job of removing mascara, too. I used to get them at Costco until they disappeared from their shelves so I was very happy to find them on Amazon auto-ship.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and these face cloths are the best!  They are also great for those who love to travel--one less liquid item to worry about!</li>
            <li> I ended up throwing these away because they smelled awful. I&#x27;ve used the brand for years (purchased in a brick and mortar store) without issues, but the boxes I received this time were just off.</li>
            <li> I love these facial cloths. I keep the packet in the shower and just wet one while showering and wipe my face clean.</li>
            <li> Love these. My skin feels so refreshed when I use these</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these cloths for years and years, and I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin. I do have some adult acne, and these cloths do not aggravate it. Very convenient for travel, also. I love seeing all the makeup I&#x27;m removing when I use the cloth!</li>
            <li> I have used these face cloths for a number of years and have found nothing that compares to the effectiveness, quality and price.</li>
            <li> These are the best facial wash cloths I&#x27;ve ever had. Been using them for 3 years! They get all my makeup off yet are gentle enough not to break me out and I have very sensitive, combo skin. LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
            <li> Love these. Been using them for years. Remove makeup easily and provide some exfoliate benefit as well. Great for traveling -- no need to soil your hostess&#x27;s washcloths or carry cleanser with you. Use them for your kids too when traveling-- sensitive formula is safe for them also.</li>
            <li> These are the only cloths I have found that don&#x27;t cause irritation on my skin.  It is rare to find them in the store so it&#x27;s great that Amazon carries them.  One more item to put on my Subscription List!</li>
            <li> These facial cloths are very effective at taking  make up off and also don&#x27;t irritate skin or leave it dry.</li>
            <li> Good product. Lathers well.</li>
            <li> I use one of these on my face every day as I shower.  I just dampen the clothe enough to release the cleanser, but not wash it away.  This leaves enough cleanser in the sturdy netted material to lather my face and remove all types of makeup, plus wash my neck.  Then it&#x27;s bye bye and into the trash; the difficult job of trying to removing makeup from a fabric clothe does not exist.  They leave my face feeling, and looking, clean while retaining moisture in the skin.  I like the fact that I am using a new, sanitary clothe on my face each time, therefore alleviating any concern as to whether it has been sanitized well enough to impede the spread of bacteria, as there is with a fabric clothe.  These are also wonderful with which to travel.  Other brands of this type of facial cleansing clothe have been rough on my skin and left my face dry.  I definitely recommend the daily use of these Olay Facial Cloths.</li>
            <li> I love these clothes because they remove all of my makeup and leave my skin feeling fresh and clean without being over dry.</li>
            <li> I like these because you add the water to them so they don&#x27;t dry out on you. great for a quick refresh</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for less than a week. It leaves my skin noticeably softer and brighter looking. Seems to do a great job at removing eye makeup, and all in all works better than wet makeup remover wipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the value is amazing. $8 for 66 sheets is already pretty good, but I cut each sheet in quarters and use it as part of both my my morning and evening routine, and have enough for over 4 months. Awesome!</li>
            <li> These are the best thing I have found to really clean my face while not overly drying my skin out.  I actually cut them in half, so they last twice as long.</li>
            <li> These are great to clean your face with out drying it out. I gave some to my daughter and she loves them too.</li>
            <li> They feel like cloth, soft, and are a good size.  They&#x27;re sudsier than I like.  Just ok.</li>
            <li> I love taking these wherever I go.  Once you add water, the clothes easily remove make up and dirt gently with olay cleanser.  The towelettes are also very nice because they have a nice texture on one side and are smooth on the other.</li>
            <li> The best wipes to get mascara and makeup off!!!  Wet it with hot water and hold it directly by the eyes.. Mascara comes off</li>
            <li> I use this nightly to remove my makeup and it works amazingly.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very soft now too.</li>
            <li> Excellent for the skin. I use it for complete skin care twice a day, can be use for all types of skin condition.</li>
            <li> Great for travel - I constantly forget to pack face wash and now I don&#x27;t have to worry about it!  This lathers up to an amazing extent.  I actually rip one of these in half to use over two washings, as there is more than enough lather and square footage (inchage?) to use across two applications.</li>
            <li> As a flight attendant they take up little space in my toiletry bag. It&#x27;s good to travel light, no extra bottles to tote around.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin. So sensitive that I have actually broken out from Burts Bees Sensitive Skin facial wipes and have a hard time finding wipes that my skin can handle. My Aunt purchased these for me to try and I LOVE them. My face actually cleared up, they don&#x27;t dry out your skin and they remove makeup! You can use them to wash your face.. run them under water and then use them to rinse the cleanser off. I use them daily. When I saw Amazon had them as a subscribe and save option I signed up right away!</li>
            <li> I have been using the olay dry cloths for years now. I really love the 4-1 cloths. they make your skin feel so clean and soft. Also great for removing make-up</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use these everyday, I tend to alternate my skin regime, but I do love these as: a &#x27;go to&#x27; when I don&#x27;t care to go through a three step process. They are so easy, you just run them under water and rub them together to activate the soap, and then cleanse. After that, just moisturize with whatever you choose to use.&lt;br /&gt;It only takes one at a time, and they always have a sufficient lather.&lt;br /&gt;Hope that helps.</li>
            <li> These area a staple for everyday use.  When moistened the cloths remove all makeup - but you have to scrub a little on the eyes to remove mascara or heavy eyeliner, which I don&#x27;t use very often.&lt;br /&gt;Love these cloths!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years! My skin face feels so clean and fresh after using this. It takes mascara off too, if it&#x27;s not waterproof. I use these in the shower, just wet with water, rub the cloth to produce suds and you are ready to use it. My skin feels perfect, not dry at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years to wash my face (almost) every night and even though I&#x27;ve tried a few different brands, I keep coming back to these.  The texture of the Sensitive variety of these facial cloths is better than the other varieties (in my opinion) and does a wonderful job of getting dirt and makeup off my face.  I do use eye makeup remover to take off mascara and eye makeup, but otherwise these cloths are enough.  I wear extended-wear foundation and that stuff doesn&#x27;t come off easily, but these cloths have no problem with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to be pretty bad about washing my face every night, and the problem was I hated splashing water on my face - it would just get everywhere.  With these cloths I just wet them with warm water, wipe them all over my face, throw them away, and follow up with a damp washcloth to get rid of the remaining cleanser.  It eliminates the splashing and I get clean without making a mess of the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No overpowering scent, doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes, doesn&#x27;t make a mess, gets my skin clean.  Perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow-up:  My most recent order of this item resulted in receiving one (not three) package of the Gentle Cleaning cloths (not Sensitive Skin).  Maybe they don&#x27;t make the Sensitive Skin any more?  Between that and only getting one package instead of three, I returned it.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive face, and I&#x27;ve Always use this product works great. Now my teenage son its hooked on it. Like the value packet works well for the both of us using it.</li>
            <li> These are the best face cloths to use.  I have never had a problem with my sensitive skin and they are great for traveling.</li>
            <li> My son uses these. He doesn&#x27;t shower daily in the winter, but I do insist he washes his face. He cant stand fragrance so we tried these and he seems to really like them.</li>
            <li> These are really good face cloths. I have sensitive skin they might be too strong for my skin lupus and rosacea.</li>
            <li> i use to buy this at costco in a 4 pack and i loved it. They stopped carrying it which made me really sad bc this works very well to remove dirt and make up. the box came differently than how i remembered it but i have been using it and it works great.</li>
            <li> I got these free when a drug store was giving away Olympic sets with purchases. I was happy to see that they were fragrance free because I have sensitive skin but they still made my skin burn and I got cysts after.They do take my makeup off though.  I use help me by philosophy which has retinol in it so maybe it just interacts poorly with these wipes. I am sure these are great for some people but I am going back to my regenerist wipes. I love them!</li>
            <li> This worked great to clean my face and remove all make up easily.  I bought this for a backpacking trip to Europe a and it was perfect, not liquid to take up precious liquid space on carry on, not moist so it can&#x27;t dry up.  I will definitely be using this again for all future trips.</li>
            <li> Just to be clear, these cloths do not exfoliate. I bought them thinking they were the sturdy cloths with one rough side and one soft. They&#x27;re just the flimsy cloths with the holes throughout. There isn&#x27;t anything wrong with these cloths as a whole. They didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. They did a mediocre job of cleaning, but not as good as I&#x27;d hoped. I really wanted something a little more substantial. They work in a pinch.</li>
            <li> This product is different with other make cleansing wipes. I used the Neutrogena one for a long time and really satisfied with it. But this is not a wet sheet and has to be soak before you use (by water.) It&#x27;s smooth and soft, but your eyes would be irritated if you try to cleanse your eye make up. I had no problem with Neutrogena&#x27;s one, and I don&#x27;t think that my eyes are very sensitive.. I would use this only for my face make up.. and don&#x27;t think that I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> was the best deal but I see the price has risen by at least $5</li>
            <li> Great for Travel. No more leaking soapy bottles. And less &amp;#34;liquid&amp;#34; to worry about when flying. It was difficult to find in stock thank goodness for AMAZON!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and years and have always purchased it in the stores.  I couldn&#x27;t believe my luck in getting such a great price as I did.  I will do it again</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know it is  good or bad but my wife only uses only this one.&lt;br /&gt;So I only buy this I did not ask she does not make comments&lt;br /&gt;and she is happy with it</li>
            <li> I like these for travel because they are dry and clean my face very well after wetting the cloth.  I have very sensitive skin and these do not irritate or overly dry my face at all.  I love the convenience of ordering them through Amazon, because they are not always available in the local stores.</li>
            <li> These cloths remove all the makeup and dirt from my pores. The cloths are so big that I cut them in half and they last me twice as long. I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I Use this especially while going on a trip, it weighs nothing and it makes my skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I think they really do the job well. Unlike others, I am a man and do not need this to remove make-up. My job can get me a little dirtier than I would like and this is a good way for me to wash my face during the day. Works very well and is very convenient.</li>
            <li> I thought these were going to be the cloths you can use right out of the package, but they&#x27;re dry - not pre-moistened. You have to get them wet and they bubble and clean, but your face and hair etc are all wet - it&#x27;s just like using face wash. I had hoped for something I could clean on the go, without making a big production and needing a towel.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Cleans perfectly, exfoliates without any harshness, fantastic for picky, sensitive skin. Exceeds expectations and the price is great!</li>
            <li> The Olay cleansing cloths clean without irritating your sking. They clean waterproof sunscreen, mascara and eyeliner without extra product intervention like eye makeup remover. I have rocesa and sensitive skin and can&#x27;t say enough about this product. It leaves my skin fealing clean, never tight or dry.</li>
            <li> I have terrible skin. Thanks, Mom. I bought these for a European trip. Light. Easily packable. My skin loved them. I cut them in half because I&#x27;m a cheap bastard plus it took up half the space. I keep a couple in a baggy in my purse for emergencies of face or injury. I also stashed some in my bug-out bag for the zombie apocalypse/tornado/fire/flood/myhousefallsoffthecliff. Great product! Will sell for food in case of the aforementioned emergencies.</li>
            <li> I first began using Olay facial cleansers for travel because they are so easy to  pack and take up so little space in my luggage.  I liked them so much that they are now my only facial cleanser whether at home or on the go.  They do a good job of removing makeup including mascara with no irritation to skin or eyes.</li>
            <li> I carry these when traveling, and they do an excellent job of removing all traces of makeup and leave my skin feeling really soft!</li>
            <li> Very refreshing feeling of clean.</li>
            <li> This Olay cleansing cloth is almost as good as the Mary Kay brand.</li>
            <li> I have used these facial cloths for years, and they are great for my skin. The order arrives within a few days.</li>
            <li> I am really not sure how these are 4 in 1, it feels like regular soap to me.... And it does a decent job of lathering and cleaning, but for the price and the 4 in 1 claims I am not impressed</li>
            <li> I love these cloths, especially for travel, because they&#x27;re easy to pack and use.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about taking special soaps or cleansers with me.</li>
            <li> I swear by these. I have super sensitive skin and these cleansing cloths do the trick. Good for removing make up and are sanitary since each cloth can only be used once. I do agree that the size is a bit big so I often cut it in half :)</li>
            <li> if you have sensitive skin the product is for you</li>
            <li> So convenient and scent free!</li>
            <li> It is good i bought 4 units of 33 each one, but it wasn&#x27;t what i expected, i wanted to try something new but the expenses of shipping and taxes were more than i would pay for it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for yrs. They are great, They remove dirt &amp; make-up easily, your skin feels clean &amp; soft. If washing at the sink, only half of the cloth is needed....does the same job &amp; saves $$. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product for sensitive skin. They lather up nicely and help exfoliate without being harsh. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These are awesome! No need to try and keep the package closed to keep them moist. Add water when you&#x27;re ready to use them. Much better for travel. They have a very slight texture to provide some exfoliation and they leave your skin soft but not oily. I still add my moisturizer afterwards. I don&#x27;t use these to remove mascara but it does remove eyeshadow and residue left from the mascara remover. I will definitely buy these again.</li>
            <li> I have quite a few allergies.  These Sensitive 4-in-1 Daily Facial Cleansing Cloths work very well with my extremely sensitive skin which is prone to contact dermatitis (allergic rash and burning).  I&#x27;m so happy with this product that I put it on my Subscribe and Save list.</li>
            <li> These facial cloths really remove makeup and they don&#x27;t have any strong perfumy smell. That&#x27;s a perfect combination as far as I am concerned</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like these.  I felt like it didn&#x27;t really clean my face and they were just as big of a pain in the butt as using normal soap and a washcloth.</li>
            <li> I love these cloths.  Like many other people, my skin does not respond well to soap or many of the other facial cleansers and body washes on then market.  I have to be careful with everything I put on my skin.  Even when my skin is irritated due to my eczema breakouts, this cloth is gentle enough to cleanse without causes major dryness and more irritation.  I highly recommend these cloths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As another reviewer mentioned, they&#x27;re also a life-saver if you&#x27;re a frequent flyer.  No liquid soaps to worry about in your carry-on or being squished and spilled in your check luggage.</li>
            <li> The Olay Sensitive 4-in-1 Daily Facial Cloths work so well for me.  They clean my face and don&#x27;t leave my skin feeling tight or itchy  the way some cleansers or soaps do.  This is a very good product.</li>
            <li> best facial cleanser ever!  have been using it for years.  It&#x27;s a wonderful product for anyone with sensitive skin or for anyone with a sensitive nose.  Virtually odorless and works wonders in removing all makeup.</li>
            <li> These daily facial cloths were recommended by my dermatologist. I use them in the morning and find that they work well for my sensitive skin -- non-drying, non-irritating and leave my skin feeling clean. They are a bit pricey -- ordering them on &amp;#34;subscribe and save&amp;#34; has previously helped, but now the pricing structure has changed and it looks like I will be paying more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also work well when traveling. Easy to pack because they are dry - ingredients activated when moistened with water and can even, if needed be used as a small wash cloth.</li>
            <li> The facial cloths arrived in great condition.  They are just what I had meant to order and the fact that there were two boxes instead of 1 made the order really special.  Wow, two for 1, don&#x27;t find that much anymore.  Thank you, I will be ordering again soon.</li>
            <li> Have used these for years and still find them to be the best facial cloths.  Am not sure why stores don&#x27;t seem to carry the sensitive ones any longer.  Am just happy that Amazon has them available.  Gently but thoroughly removes makeup without irritating my skin.  Would recommend them to anyone looking for a product like this.</li>
            <li> Great product always leaves my skin feeling clean but not dry.</li>
            <li> Well pleased with product and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these cleansing cloths for some time.  Really love them.  Sudsy, gentle, thorough - they leave a fresh feeling.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for awhile. Nice to find it for such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Love to use these whipes.  Cleans my face very well.</li>
            <li> Love these! I use them every day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought these from Amazon several times, because my local drugstore (CVS) insists on stocking only their store brand and not the Olay brand.  As someone with sensitive skin, I won&#x27;t take a chance with a knock-off product on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clothes work well to take off all makeup, or to cleanup after I&#x27;ve worked in the garden.&lt;br /&gt;They are great to use for travelling too - I can pack a few in a ziplock bag, and have them with me when needed.</li>
            <li> I use these cloths every morning and night. They work so much better than your fingers, and I like the fact that I don&#x27;t have tons of washcloths lying around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good: They leave your face feeling squeaky clean without being too harsh.&lt;br /&gt;The Bad: They are too big. To save money, I cut them into fourths.&lt;br /&gt;The Comparison: These are my favorite facial cloths because they aren&#x27;t pre-moistened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fast way to wash your face and get all the make-up off.  It&#x27;s also not drying. Good product.</li>
            <li> Product was what I ordered; the boxes were a little bit torn/bent up though. This wouldn&#x27;t be an issue at all except that it irked me because it&#x27;s something I&#x27;m putting on my face (sensitive skin) and don&#x27;t want it tampered with. I would however, reccomend the foaming face wash as an alternative. It&#x27;s a little more sensitive/not as abrasive as using a wipe and it does the job getting make up off.</li>
            <li> Oh yesâ€¦ This is so nice on the face</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL PRODUCT. I am a woman of a certain age and these facial clothes help keep my skin clear. I ran to Amazon when Costco stopped carrying them. Thank the HEAVENS for Amazon!  Love this product and the vendor was wonderful. Very timely delivery with no problems.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Love these facial cloths.  Have been using them for years and am happy that they are so easy to get on Amazon since my local store is usually out.</li>
            <li> My daughter has sensitive skin and these are one of the only products she can use.  They are great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using wipes to remove makeup at night for a long time.  I&#x27;ve tried just about every brand.  I never found one I liked more than others.  They all did an adequate job, but I never felt like my face was really clean.  Then, I tried the Olay daily facial cloths, and really love them.  I feel like my face is a lot cleaner after using them.  They&#x27;re different than wipes in that the cloth is dry.  They&#x27;re meant to run under water for just a second, activating the soap.  Then, once your face is clean, you run the cloth under water for a few seconds to remove the remainder of soak and most of the makeup, and wipe the soap off your face.</li>
