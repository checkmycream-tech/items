            <li>I love this brush n</li>
            <li>Glad that I did</li>
            <li>sigma brushes are fabulous!</li>
            <li>and I love the curvature.</li>
            <li>I counld not imagine if the single brush could do so much, perfect concealing brush, can reach any place under eye and around the nose, would definately recommend and be purchasing every sigma brushes :)</li>
            <li>My brush came quickly and works amazing.</li>
            <li>Fits under my eyes easily.</li>
            <li>Love this angled brush... perfect for applying concealer to the dark undereye circles and great for getting into the inner corners of eyes!</li>
            <li>Works great for under the eyes, sides of nose and pretty much anywhere else</li>
            <li>Flawless skin, not cakey and less product being used!</li>
            <li>love this brush it puts color right where you want it</li>
            <li>Love it - will get another when this gets old - is perfect for undereye makeup - those dark circles, you know?!</li>
            <li>Yes, the hype is true.</li>
            <li>I also feel that I can use lighter strokes to do my concealer compared to the flat brush I used to use, which is good news for not stretching my under-eye skin.</li>
            <li>I do wish i got the flat top brush instead because the top bristles on the angle will cause the concealer to streak.  </li>
            <li>But the flat top brush may work better for blending concealer.</li>
            <li>Sigma are my new favorite brushes.</li>
            <li>Well sigma is my new favorite brand of brushes...</li>
            <li>SOFT!!!!</li>

            <li>it deposits the color of my concealer really well.  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t bother me that much because I like that the color of my concealer is saturated.</li>
            <li>It works really well.  </li>
            <li>This brush is very versatile,,,,, can be used for eye shadow, concealer, eyeshadow primer.....</li>
            <li>, I just use the other, more dense edges away from the angled bristles.  </li>
            <li>The right tools make all the difference, especially when it comes to makeup application.  </li>
            <li>This is my first sigma brush but definitely not last!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got soft and somewhat fluffy bristles which makes applying concealer really easy.</li>
            <li>The bristles are dense yet still soft.  </li>
            <li>Its still a soft and dense brush.  </li>
            <li>They are so soft and the brushes do not shed.</li>
            <li>It looks so professional.</li>
            <li>brissels are soft and don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li>Best brush you could use for concealer or to apply eye base cream.</li>

            <li> But it&#x27;s a bit hard to apply cream concealer directly from the pan; instead, I dab some on on my skin with my fingers and blend with this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For years I used to dot on concealer with my finger to hide my blemishes and most of the time it looked cakey because of excessive layering and poor blending but then after using this brush it is now in my everyday foundation routine!  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t shead and are thick and soft</li>
            <li> It works especially well in small areas along the sides of the nose</li>
            <li> I also tried using this to do over all concealer on my nose, cheek and forehead area, works well for that too, but maybe a little bit too small.</li>
            <li> I just tap this brush on my blemishes a few times and VOILA!</li>
            <li> The bristles are firm, yet not scratchy or irritating.  </li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong with Sigma brushes.</li>

            <li> Loving this brush!! So glad that I made the decision to purchase it!  Sigma are my new favorite brushes. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Sigma never disappoints! My brush came quickly and works amazing. Happy I got one that was made in the USA because I heard that are switching but its wonderful!</li>
            <li> Yes, the hype is true. This brush is amazing. It&#x27;s perfect for stippling in the concealer around the nose/eye area. This is my first sigma brush but definitely not last!</li>

Anyways, the best concealer brush I have ever tried, highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The bristles are dense yet still soft.  Its perfect for the under eye area.  I like that it deposits the color of my concealer really well.  I find that I still have to blend the color out with a fluffier brush or my fingers but it doesn&#x27;t bother me that much because I like that the color of my concealer is saturated.</li>
            <li> I use this brush to blend out the concealer under my eyes.  It works really well.  I do wish i got the flat top brush instead because the top bristles on the angle will cause the concealer to streak.  Its nothing I can&#x27;t fix, I just use the other, more dense edges away from the angled bristles.  Its still a soft and dense brush.  But the flat top brush may work better for blending concealer.</li>
            <li> Love sigma brushes! I only use the sigma brushes because they are great quality!</li>
            <li> The right tools make all the difference, especially when it comes to makeup application.  I use this brush to blend in contouring. It works especially well in small areas along the sides of the nose etc. I would definitely recommend this brush to others.</li>
            <li> Its very good for the concealer</li>
            <li> A really soft and incredible concealer brush! It is easy to use, washes nicely, and blends out concealer without lifting the product away. I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>

            <li> I bought this item as a gift for my wife which  works as a make-up master and she was very satisfied to use sigma brushes</li>
            <li> I counld not imagine if the single brush could do so much, perfect concealing brush, can reach any place under eye and around the nose, would definately recommend and be purchasing every sigma brushes :)</li>
            <li> Great brush for placing under eye concealer!</li>
            <li> I start using this brush for concealing my under eye area. Like the others precision brushes, it&#x27;s another must have. Highly recommend to everyone that want to have a flawless finish.</li>
            <li> Well sigma is my new favorite brand of brushes... This brush is very versatile,,,,, can be used for eye shadow, concealer, eyeshadow primer..... I love this brush n glad that I bought it because I was skeptical about buyin this particular brush... Glad that I did</li>
            <li> sigma brushes are fabulous!</li>
            <li> Love this angled brush... perfect for applying concealer to the dark undereye circles and great for getting into the inner corners of eyes!</li>
            <li> SOFT!!!! No shedding when I moved the brush hair to see. Fits under my eyes easily. Handle have a nice thickness.</li>
            <li> i was suprised at how well they work didn&#x27;t shead and are thick and soft&lt;br /&gt;i saw it on ytube and had to try  mac doesn&#x27;t have a bruch like this</li>
            <li> I thought I had good brushes until I received the Sigma brushes. I have a brush for every type of application. They are so soft and the brushes do not shed. The case is the icing on the cake. It looks so professional. I am very happy with my purchase. I have returned for additional brushes.</li>
            <li> Works great for under the eyes, sides of nose and pretty much anywhere else you want to use it. You really can&#x27;t go wrong with Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> I bought this to apply under-eye concealer and I love the curvature. It fits perfectly underneath my eyes! But it&#x27;s a bit hard to apply cream concealer directly from the pan; instead, I dab some on on my skin with my fingers and blend with this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in summary, good brush to blend, but not apply!</li>
            <li> I keep this brush in my makeup bag. It picks up my shadows perfectly and applies it where I want the color. I haven&#x27;t had any fallout from the bristles at all. The bristles are firm, yet not scratchy or irritating.  It washes and dries great. The only concern I have is that I have had other Sigma brushes separate (the handles), so I am worried that it may happen at some point, but for now, the brush performs as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using sigma brushes for over a year now and I just love it! Superior quality and inferior price &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Best brush you could use for concealer or to apply eye base cream. brissels are soft and don&#x27;t shed. Need a Sigma store in the Phoenix area.</li>
            <li> Love it - will get another when this gets old - is perfect for undereye makeup - those dark circles, you know?!</li>
