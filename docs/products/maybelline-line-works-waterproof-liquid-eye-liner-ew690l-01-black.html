            <li>so happy</li>
            <li>It goes on great.</li>
            <li>I use to always buy my eyeliner at the mall, I saw this and tried it and loved it, one great Product from Mableline.</li>
            <li>Thinking this eyeliner would be good since it was GREAT from the &#x27;50s to the &#x27;80s.</li>
            <li>It has the perfect consistency with a precise applicator.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved it.</li>
            <li>This is my FAVORITE eyeliner, I have been using it for years!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t seem to find it in stores anymore, but I am happy that it is still available online.</li>
            <li>and they asked for some kind of code or something, which I didn&#x27;t have because I threw all the packaging away.</li>
            <li>It is also true to its name of being WATERPROOF!!</li>
            <li>Has a wonderful pointed tip--not a brush, making application clean and straight.</li>
            <li>im able to purchase it here.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this Maybelline eye liner for years and hadn&#x27;t been able to find it anywhere.</li>
            <li>The one and only eye liner with the perfect felt tip applicator.</li>
            <li>Ive been buying this eyeliner for more than 10 yrs</li>
            <li>Well, every time I went there to pick up more they were sold out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased the same eye liner from the drugstores since and it&#x27;s been perfect</li>
            <li>if eyeliner is the signature of ur make up style (mine is) then this will become ur favorite eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I 100% guarantee u will love this liner.</li>
            <li>When I received it in the mail I was very excited.</li>
            <li>it last all day long and has an awesome tip to get the perfect wing shape.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I&#x27;ve been using this exact product for a good 8 years...</li>
            <li>Because this eyeliner is suppose to be waterproof, I would expect it to be more water resistant and hold up better in the humidity by not fading, running, or smudging as easily.  </li>
            <li>Some of the others, however, were fine.</li>
            <li>This is a relatively inexpensive product, and a great starter product for those just getting used to liquid eyeliner or for those just learning to use make-up.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, only eyeliner I trust.</li>
            <li>So, I bought Revlon&#x27;s colorstay and it lasted allday without flaking,chipping or fading and it costs more but its worth the money.</li>
            <li>, bought it for her, she was happy and she loves this specific brand name and model..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with my purchases up until my most recent one.</li>
            <li>I was told by a misinformed employee at my local drug store that this eye liner was being discontinued and they wouldn&#x27;t be getting more in, so decided to order SEVERAL because this is the best liner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I usually loved this eyeliner and bought it from amazon frequently, especially since they discontinued it in stores.</li>
            <li>No mess, no fuss, very easy to control and apply.</li>
            <li>But, still worth the purchase if you can&#x27;t find it in stores.</li>
            <li>For those who are curious-the top black/brown park unscrews and is a wand with a fine brush at the end, and the bottom holds the product, similar to old inkwells.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m so sad that they are discontinued everywhere, and I&#x27;m hoping that if I leave great reviews everywhere that Maybelliner will bring it backkk!!!</li>
            <li>I love it because it&#x27;s the only one with an applicator that works for lining the inside of my eye.</li>
            <li>You have better control the way the top-handle is made and fits into your hand making it easier to apply, and it stays on until you wash it off with some type of facial cleanser or make-up remover.  </li>
            <li>your eyes not looking like you have on too much!  </li>
            <li>I actually like this mascara a lot, and prefer this one over many others bc of the ability to control the line.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s truly waterproof and yet not flaky, creates a nice solid black line and is very controllable with that nice pointy tipped</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite liquid eye liner for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li>It worked fine the first day i had it, but from the second day on, it had no pigment in it at all.</li>
            <li>I assumed if it was the exact same liner as I&#x27;ve always used it would be fine.</li>
            <li>This gives a nice shade that blends into my eyelashes very well when using black mascara.</li>
            <li>Since the product is discontinued, the products being sold from this seller are most likely part of a very old stock of the product.</li>
            <li>The brush itself is medium tipped, and does fan/flatten out over time, but this is still more thin than most pencil eye liners I have tried.</li>
            <li>When sweating a lot, or on particularly humid days-I have noticed that this eyeliner contributes to the raccoon eyes that certain mascaras will give you.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner glides on with ease, gives me the fine point definition I desire, and literally STAYS PUT ALL DAY LONG.  </li>
            <li>I love the dark black color and smooth consistency that is all just right for me.</li>
            <li>I bought more than one and each one last a long time.</li>
            <li>The tip is just right so that I can steadily draw a clean line inside my eye; all other applicators i&#x27;ve tried have the flimsy brush kind that gets alll over my eye if i try to line inside my eye and even other brands with felt tips are too soft and are messy to use.</li>
            <li>well the formula apparently has changed a whole lot.</li>
            <li>The black component of this eyeliner is very pigmented and not dulled down by glitter of any kind.</li>
            <li>Although I no longer use makeup frequently, when I used this every day the bottle lasted about 6 weeks-and by the end the brush was noticeably wider.  </li>
            <li>One of the eyeliners I received arrived completely seperated, and therefore had no pigment</li>
            <li>This is a quality product, if you are not a makeup expert this eyeliner will make you look like a professional did your eyes.</li>
            <li>But for some reason, mine must have been old,</li>
            <li>I use brown, not black:</li>
            <li>It is veryyyy long-lasting, through sweating all night dancing at clubs or lasting all through my normal day, it does not smudge or fade.</li>
            <li>It goes on thin and smooth and in a single stroke, making the lines clean and</li>
            <li>Im sorry to say this item doesn&#x27;t work, the regular eyeliner works really good.</li>

            <li> Im sorry to say this item doesn&#x27;t work, the regular eyeliner works really good.</li>
            <li> bc they dried out very quickly (even though the cover was closed tight....).</li>
            <li> I exclusively use liquid eyeliner and never stuck with eyeliner pencil for any length of time, so I cannot give a comparison between the long lasting effectiveness, color, etc.</li>
            <li> The color is not dark enough, and if you don&#x27;t apply it dark enough, it looks grey.</li>
            <li> The flat black/long lasting/easy to use liner made this my go-to every-day liner.</li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t feel like going to the trouble to get the seller to believe I needed new ones.</li>
            <li> I feel as if it was old and separated because it did not go on black and was running.</li>
            <li> Sadly, because of this experience I will be trying out some other eyeliners because I don&#x27;t feel like taking the risk of buying more seperated ones.</li>
            <li> This mascara is so watery, and while it stays on for a long time without smudging, creasing, or anything else.</li>
            <li> and you need several coats; well this generally isn&#x27;t the case in the past and still to this day in my experience.</li>
            <li> I see some other complainants say it was grey</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the last 3x I bought this product the eyeliner was very liquidy and had no pigmentation at all.</li>
            <li> but it was a watery grey mess.</li>
            <li> Bought it for a friend, apparently in &amp;#34;Dallas Texas&amp;#34; it is getting somewhat hard to find these ?</li>
            <li> After receiving it from amazon on time, my only complaint is the eyeliner seems old or a little dryer than usual.</li>
            <li> they both were extremely watered down.....</li>
            <li> I ordered black and the packaging says black</li>
            <li> It was not cheap</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t order it folks; it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> For a liquid eyeliner, the consistency is a little on the thin side (compared to other liquid eyeliners I have tried, Revelon, Lancome, etc).</li>
            <li> I am forced to buy this online because stores don&#x27;t carry it like they used to.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this eyeliner in any stores anymore which is really disappointing since I have used this eyeliner for SO long.</li>
            <li> NOW maybelline liners price and NO good.</li>
            <li> I got tired of wasting time and gas</li>
            <li> I ended up buying a new eyeliner worst product ever</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used expensive liquid eyeliners like Clinique, Lancome, and Mac and by the end of the day they made me look like a racoon and faded.</li>
            <li> Never again will I buy an expensive eyeliner.</li>
            <li> My reading is flawed.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I just got a bad batch or what.</li>
            <li> it was still just as bad.</li>
            <li> Now it doesn&#x27;t even show up on my eye. :(</li>

            <li> This eyeliner is the best! It&#x27;s truly waterproof and yet not flaky, creates a nice solid black line and is very controllable with that nice pointy tipped applicator!&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t ordered this from Amazon yet, but I&#x27;m just reviewing because this is my FAVORITEEE liquid eyeliner of all time!!! And I&#x27;m so sad that they are discontinued everywhere, and I&#x27;m hoping that if I leave great reviews everywhere that Maybelliner will bring it backkk!!! I have used it for yearsss, and I haven&#x27;t found anything with the same applicator!! I love it because it&#x27;s the only one with an applicator that works for lining the inside of my eye. The tip is just right so that I can steadily draw a clean line inside my eye; all other applicators i&#x27;ve tried have the flimsy brush kind that gets alll over my eye if i try to line inside my eye and even other brands with felt tips are too soft and are messy to use. It is also true to its name of being WATERPROOF!! It is veryyyy long-lasting, through sweating all night dancing at clubs or lasting all through my normal day, it does not smudge or fade. I love the dark black color and smooth consistency that is all just right for me. I WISH THEY kept selling it in stores!!! Why was it discontinued???!?!?! Please bring it back, Maybelline!!!!!</li>
            <li> I used this one for yrs but could no longer find it in stores. Tried others but wasnt to happy with the results, im so happy im able to purchase it here. It goes on great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 10 years now and I love it.  I just can&#x27;t believe they don&#x27;t sell it at CVS or Target anymore.  I hope this product wont discontinue online.</li>

For a liquid eyeliner, the consistency is a little on the thin side (compared to other liquid eyeliners I have tried, Revelon, Lancome, etc). Although the eyeliner does not crack or stress like some eyeliners I see women wearing, it essentially fades away after wearing all day. When sweating a lot, or on particularly humid days-I have noticed that this eyeliner contributes to the raccoon eyes that certain mascaras will give you. Because this eyeliner is suppose to be waterproof, I would expect it to be more water resistant and hold up better in the humidity by not fading, running, or smudging as easily.

            <li> I bought this eyeliner thinking it was excellent like the one in the &#x27;70s well the formula apparently has changed a whole lot. I bought this from the drugstore. I&#x27;ve used expensive liquid eyeliners like Clinique, Lancome, and Mac and by the end of the day they made me look like a racoon and faded. Never again will I buy an expensive eyeliner. Thinking this eyeliner would be good since it was GREAT from the &#x27;50s to the &#x27;80s. I tried it after one hour my eyelids had smudged, the line on my lids was cracked they peeled and started falling into my eyes. That was day one. I figured they changed the formula so I through it away. It was not cheap NOW maybelline liners price and NO good. So, I bought Revlon&#x27;s colorstay and it lasted allday without flaking,chipping or fading and it costs more but its worth the money. I will NEVER buy Maybelline again. I don&#x27;t know why they changed the formula from the &#x27;80s but that was a BIG mistake. Do not buy this liner unless you want your liner to flake off and fall into your eyes.</li>
            <li> This mascara is so watery, and while it stays on for a long time without smudging, creasing, or anything else. The color is not dark enough, and if you don&#x27;t apply it dark enough, it looks grey.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite liquid eye liner for as long as I can remember. Once Maybelline discontinued selling it in stores, I turned to amazon and began ordering it online in bulk (about 4 to 5 eyeliners at a time). I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with my purchases up until my most recent one. Since the product is discontinued, the products being sold from this seller are most likely part of a very old stock of the product. One of the eyeliners I received arrived completely seperated, and therefore had no pigment and I had to throw it out. Some of the others, however, were fine. Sadly, because of this experience I will be trying out some other eyeliners because I don&#x27;t feel like taking the risk of buying more seperated ones. I will miss this product!</li>
            <li> I am forced to buy this online because stores don&#x27;t carry it like they used to.  Although the quality is not quite the same as when it is found in stores; buying online is cheaper and a guaranteed way to receive this eyeliner when I need it. After receiving it from amazon on time, my only complaint is the eyeliner seems old or a little dryer than usual. But, still worth the purchase if you can&#x27;t find it in stores. I purchased two at a time for about 4 dollars each.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely go through amazon again for this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> This is not the same quality as when I purchased it in stores. I feel as if it was old and separated because it did not go on black and was running.</li>
            <li> I usually loved this eyeliner and bought it from amazon frequently, especially since they discontinued it in stores. Unfortunately, the last 3x I bought this product the eyeliner was very liquidy and had no pigmentation at all. I won&#x27;t bother buying this product again.</li>
            <li> Ive been buying this eyeliner for more than 10 yrs it is the best i dnt why maybelline stop making it</li>
            <li> This is my FAVORITE eyeliner, I have been using it for years! There was a time where I could not find it in the stores, so I came to Amazon (since they always have everything).</li>
            <li> This is the best eyeliner ever made. It has the perfect consistency with a precise applicator. I can&#x27;t seem to find it in stores anymore, but I am happy that it is still available online.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner glides on with ease, gives me the fine point definition I desire, and literally STAYS PUT ALL DAY LONG.  I have used this eyeliner for years and will never use another again!  I LOVE IT!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> the product is terrific.  My reading is flawed.  I use brown, not black: no fault of the seller.</li>
            <li> I like this eye liner by Maybelline and this packaging.  They changed it and it seems I can only find it on line -- but it&#x27;s the &#x27;tip&#x27; that makes this work so well because the way it is made allows it to go on so well.  You have better control the way the top-handle is made and fits into your hand making it easier to apply, and it stays on until you wash it off with some type of facial cleanser or make-up remover.  It goes on thin and smooth and in a single stroke, making the lines clean and your eyes not looking like you have on too much!  No racoon eyes, here!</li>
            <li> This is a quality product, if you are not a makeup expert this eyeliner will make you look like a professional did your eyes. Totally recommended</li>
            <li> Bought it for a friend, apparently in &amp;#34;Dallas Texas&amp;#34; it is getting somewhat hard to find these ?&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, bought it for her, she was happy and she loves this specific brand name and model..</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 eyeliners...they both were extremely watered down.....it wouldn&#x27;t even show up on my eye. I ended up buying a new eyeliner worst product ever</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I just got a bad batch or what. But I&#x27;ve used this liner for years and the only place that carries it around here is Walmart. Well, every time I went there to pick up more they were sold out. I got tired of wasting time and gas so I looked online and found it here. I bought 2 because I knew I would run out before I could get to the store and when I opened it up and tried to use it, it was like water. Literally no pigment at all stuck to my lid and when I tried shaking it, and testing on my hand it was still just as bad. I didn&#x27;t try the second one. I messaged the seller and told them my problem and they asked for some kind of code or something, which I didn&#x27;t have because I threw all the packaging away. I assumed if it was the exact same liner as I&#x27;ve always used it would be fine. But I didn&#x27;t feel like going to the trouble to get the seller to believe I needed new ones. So I just ate the money. Go buy this at the store.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I&#x27;ve been using this exact product for a good 8 years... I was told by a misinformed employee at my local drug store that this eye liner was being discontinued and they wouldn&#x27;t be getting more in, so decided to order SEVERAL because this is the best liner I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve always loved it. The flat black/long lasting/easy to use liner made this my go-to every-day liner. Well, all the eyeliners I received were garbage! I ordered black and the packaging says black but it was a watery grey mess. I couldn&#x27;t even use it. I&#x27;ve purchased the same eye liner from the drugstores since and it&#x27;s been perfect so I don&#x27;t know what this order was all about. I see some other complainants say it was grey and you need several coats; well this generally isn&#x27;t the case in the past and still to this day in my experience. Don&#x27;t order it folks; it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I actually like this mascara a lot, and prefer this one over many others bc of the ability to control the line.  But for some reason, mine must have been old, bc they dried out very quickly (even though the cover was closed tight....).</li>
            <li> Im sorry to say this item doesn&#x27;t work, the regular eyeliner works really good. Everytime I go to the beach I come out of the water and its smudging and not there anymore, not buying again.</li>
            <li> this is the best eyeliner ever invented. if eyeliner is the signature of ur make up style (mine is) then this will become ur favorite eyeliner. i use this item on a daily basis and use it for the &amp;#34;cat eyes&amp;#34; style. it last all day long and has an awesome tip to get the perfect wing shape. I 100% guarantee u will love this liner.</li>
