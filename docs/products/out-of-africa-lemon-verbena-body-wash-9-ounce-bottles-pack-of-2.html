            <li>It&#x27;s natural, it smells delicious and it helps others in purchasing.  </li>
            <li>One of the lady nurses suggested this (love those 40yr vets, they know all the tricks</li>
            <li>, you know you do :) ).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already ordered more.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Would love to see soap and bubble bath by this company.  </li>
            <li>What more to ask.</li>
            <li>I bought one of these to test, then ordered 2 more.</li>
            <li>but it hasn&#x27;t in too many months.  </li>
            <li>I just love the scent.</li>
            <li>I love how this has no parabens and sulfates.</li>
            <li>If it would ever come back in stock, it would be lovely!!!</li>
            <li>This is a really high quality product for a great price.  </li>
            <li>This is a really high quality product for a great price when you catch it on sale.</li>
            <li>the smell is so nice and fresh</li>
            <li>Just love the smell and the clean, smooth feeling of my skin when I use them.</li>
            <li>It was given to me as a fit.  </li>
            <li>a great product.&lt;br /&gt;5 stars, would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>My sensitive skin feels so good after I shower with this stuff...</li>
            <li>Lovely scent and had the right amount of lather and moisturizing effect on skin.</li>
            <li>Have been using for several years now and love, love, love it</li>
            <li>This is the first time after many many years that I&#x27;ve found a body wash that actually smells nice hours after the shower.</li>
            <li>I would describe the &amp;#34;lemon verbena&amp;#34; scent as a very soft citrus/herbal fragrance, perfect for summertime and those who live in very humid climates.  </li>
            <li>i have very sensitive skin and this product works great for my sensitive skin as well as gives me a very fresh and clean feel.</li>
            <li>Really really :)</li>
            <li>but it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>no bad reactions at all.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is nice and functional with a simple flip-top lid.  </li>
            <li>Smells Great-Leaves skin feeling fresh</li>
            <li>the smell is so nice and fresh, and it lathers a ton so it lasts for a really long time.  </li>
            <li>Reminiscent of the one used in the showers at Bliss Spa but even better since it&#x27;s a more natural option.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to find in at my local supermarket, but they phased it out.  </li>
            <li>I personally use the  Lemon Verbena and I absolutely love the scent.  </li>
            <li>It reminds me of a lotion that I used to buy at Bath and Body Works called Limelight that they introduced when the store first opened.  </li>
            <li>I will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>I have come back and bought 6 more twin packs gave a lot away</li>
            <li>so I will have to be back to buy more</li>
            <li>and when I use this shower gel, I don&#x27;t even need to apply lotion afterwards because the shower gel is so rich and creamy and leaves my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li>I usually avoid buying shampoo or soap that have overwhelming fruity scent, but this has very fresh citrus scent which is not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s really runny.</li>
            <li>All I wanted was a body wash that really smelled like lemons.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s is very lemon-limey.  </li>
            <li>This shower gel works well for me and leaves me moisturized for the whole day.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>so you have to remove the cap, bang in on the tub, squeeze the bottle and too much always comes out.</li>
            <li>It is crisp and refreshing and cools me down in the blazing heat.  </li>
            <li>Used to be really nice and thick, didn&#x27;t have to use as much to lather.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This is so moisturizing that you can just use this high quality shower butter and skip the separate moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended vs all the other stuff you can buy in retail stores plus the name is cool!</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin clean and fresh without feeling dried out.</li>
            <li>so it works well on dry skin brining it back to life or maintains healthy skin.</li>
            <li>It lathers very well with small amount of liquid and washes off easily.</li>
            <li>(everything I fall in love with eventually disappears and will usually get replaced with something that doesn&#x27;t work as well).  </li>
            <li>It also last forever as you don&#x27;t need much to do the job!</li>
            <li>Well, the product itself is better than average but big problem is &#x27;delivery&#x27;.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also all natural and vegan (if that sweetens the pot for you).</li>
            <li>This by far</li>
            <li>The scent is natural and not chemical smelling.</li>
            <li>I love lemon/lime smells and this deliveries, and it lathers a ton just use a little bit and it lasts for a really long time.</li>
            <li>Has the same great smell, but really disappointed.</li>

            <li> too much trouble for me.</li>

            <li> They changed the formula. Used to be really nice and thick, didn&#x27;t have to use as much to lather. Now it&#x27;s really runny. Has the same great smell, but really disappointed. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the Out of Africa Lemon Verbena products.  Just love the smell and the clean, smooth feeling of my skin when I use them.</li>
            <li> I received this delightful body wash as a gift years ago and my skin is thankful every time I shower!</li>
            <li> When you work with body fluids for a living, you take your ol&amp;#34; factory pleasures when you can. All I wanted was a body wash that really smelled like lemons. And this does. One of the lady nurses suggested this (love those 40yr vets, they know all the tricks, you know you do :) ). This is a keeper. I&#x27;ve already ordered more.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great...the smell is so nice and fresh, and it lathers a ton so it lasts for a really long time.  My skin feels so good since I&#x27;ve started using it.  It contains 20% shea butter, as opposed to maybe 2 or 5% in other soaps.  This is a really high quality product for a great price.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I use this shower gel every day.  I used to be able to find in at my local supermarket, but they phased it out.  Now I buy the bottles on Amazon.  I stock up like crazy cause I don&#x27;t know when they are going to be taken off the market (everything I fall in love with eventually disappears and will usually get replaced with something that doesn&#x27;t work as well).  I have terribly dry and cracked skin and when I use this shower gel, I don&#x27;t even need to apply lotion afterwards because the shower gel is so rich and creamy and leaves my skin so soft.  These are pricy, but you need so little every time you shower.  I use a shower puff and I only need to apply an amount the size of a nickle on the puff and it lathers like crazy.  Someone wrote on here that they aren&#x27;t too crazy about the scent.  I personally use the  Lemon Verbena and I absolutely love the scent.  It&#x27;s is very lemon-limey.  It reminds me of a lotion that I used to buy at Bath and Body Works called Limelight that they introduced when the store first opened.  The scent lasted only a few months and then disappeared.  Back then, their lotions actually worked well, but over the years their ingredients have cheapened and they don&#x27;t moisturize like they used to.  But I digress.  This shower gel works well for me and leaves me moisturized for the whole day.  It&#x27;s also all natural and vegan (if that sweetens the pot for you).</li>

            <li> I have been looking all over for this scent  but could only find extremely overpriced items. This was nicely priced, a good size and a nice pleasant lingering fragrance without being too overpowering.  I will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> Lovely scent and had the right amount of lather and moisturizing effect on skin. A pity they don&#x27;t have a bigger sized bottle.</li>
            <li> Love the feel, the smell and the moisturizing results! The bottles are a little small but they come two to a pack! Will definitely keep using!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Beautiful scent without being over the top.  Great lather.  Would love to see soap and bubble bath by this company.  I will order this again, and again, and again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural, it smells delicious and it helps others in purchasing.  What more to ask.</li>
            <li> I really like it.  It was given to me as a fit.  I love the smell and it is very pleasant o use.  A dream</li>
            <li> This by far the best body wash  I have ever tried in years I have come back and bought 6 more twin packs gave a lot away so I will have to be back to buy more I can never run our of this it is totally awesome BUY IT YOU WILL TOTATLY LOVE IT!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought one of these to test, then ordered 2 more. I usually avoid buying shampoo or soap that have overwhelming fruity scent, but this has very fresh citrus scent which is not overpowering at all. It lathers very well with small amount of liquid and washes off easily. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> They have changed the formula.  It is watery and runny.  You have to use a lot to create any lather at all, although now you can put a pump on the bottle and it will go through.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> Smells Great-Leaves skin feeling fresh</li>
            <li> Love this body wash and the smells is very wonderful. It leaves my skin clean and fresh without feeling dried out.</li>

            <li> This is a really nice, luxurious wash.  The scent is natural and not chemical smelling.</li>
            <li> This is so moisturizing that you can just use this high quality shower butter and skip the separate moisturizer.  It also last forever as you don&#x27;t need much to do the job!</li>
            <li> My husband &amp; I love this body wash! Reminiscent of the one used in the showers at Bliss Spa but even better since it&#x27;s a more natural option.</li>
            <li> nice scent and lather</li>
            <li> i am very satisfied with this product and will continue to purchase it. i have very sensitive skin and this product works great for my sensitive skin as well as gives me a very fresh and clean feel.</li>
            <li> Have been using for several years now and love, love, love it</li>
            <li> I just love the scent. This is the first time after many many years that I&#x27;ve found a body wash that actually smells nice hours after the shower. I&#x27;m really happy with this body wash. Really really :)</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim and I must say, this body wash is da bomb!  My sensitive skin feels so good after I shower with this stuff...no bad reactions at all.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is nice and functional with a simple flip-top lid.  The liquid itself is creamy and silky; a little goes a long way.  I would describe the &amp;#34;lemon verbena&amp;#34; scent as a very soft citrus/herbal fragrance, perfect for summertime and those who live in very humid climates.  It is crisp and refreshing and cools me down in the blazing heat.  I can&#x27;t say whether all of the ingredients are all-natural but it is still a great product.&lt;br /&gt;5 stars, would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Well, the product itself is better than average but big problem is &#x27;delivery&#x27;. Doesn&#x27;t oome with a pump so i used one from another bottle of product.  sorry, it won&#x27;t go through the pump.  so you have to remove the cap, bang in on the tub, squeeze the bottle and too much always comes out. too much trouble for me.</li>
            <li> I love how this has no parabens and sulfates. Not a big fan of the smell but it goes away quickly.</li>
