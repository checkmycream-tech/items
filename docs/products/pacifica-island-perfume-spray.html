            <li>This is an amazing scent!!  </li>
            <li>The Indian Coco Nut fragrance is a beautiful summer fragrance.  </li>
            <li>The Pacifica coconut nectar perfume that my mother in law bought at the store smells beautiful.</li>
            <li>This is a great alternative for my daughter</li>
            <li>lol...</li>

            <li>This is a surprisingly &amp;#34;delicious&amp;#34; smelling perfume and I have lots of compliments every time I wear it.  </li>
            <li>I tried hers and loved it.</li>
            <li>Alone this is a sophisticated version of cherry chapstick and Hawaiian tropic suntan lotion - great for capturing those youthful summer memories but</li>

            <li>AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Pacifica is a wonderful, ethical brand that I trust.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I own both the roll-on and spray versions, and I have to say I prefer the spray.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t enjoy smelling like suntan lotion, you should probably avoid; however, I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li>Come back to it every spring and find it&#x27;s a perfect warm weather  scent.</li>
            <li>very cheap smelling...would not recommend.</li>
            <li>Love  the fact they are a company that is committed to non-animal testing and use no harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>smells ok if you want to wear something like your vanilla car freshener...</li>
            <li>love love love it.</li>
            <li>smells like coconut and vanilla my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of coconut.</li>
            <li>I purchased the sample kit and love the roll on perfume and lotion.</li>
            <li>I love this and will never use anything else...</li>
            <li>I love the smell of coconut, and love the smell of this perfume.  </li>
            <li>Love it and can&#x27;t get it in stores anymore</li>
            <li>I love the smell of it-</li>
            <li>My husband gets headaches from most perfumes.</li>
            <li>I love coconut</li>
            <li>I love all coconut scents, and this is a pretty good one.</li>
            <li>So this is a a very good, relatively inexpensive alternative for me.  </li>
            <li>It still smells like sweet mystical coconuts to me!</li>
            <li>I love the beachy, sweet scent of this perfume.  </li>
            <li>love the smell and sweet coconut air about it.</li>
            <li>Very fresh, clean and sexy in an understated way.</li>
            <li>Luckily he doesn&#x27;t when I wear this!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s playful and light.</li>
            <li>i love coconut scents and was looking for a good one that i could wear daily.  </li>
            <li>The entire Pacifica line is available with samples at Whole Foods, so it was great to be able to smell them all before buying.</li>
            <li>Love the scent so much.</li>
            <li>I really like it because most people who have smelled it on me have called it &amp;#34;yummy&amp;#34;  -- which I like.</li>
            <li>Probably good for a younger person.</li>
            <li>but I feel this is too candy sweet to wear alone.  </li>
            <li>and it came out way too sweet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased the solid perfume of this scent and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my third bottle and buy it from a vendor on Amazon and have been very pleased.</li>
            <li>its not really unpleasant, but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mostly vanilla (which is very nice), with the coconut adding a faint hint of the exotic.</li>
            <li>I really hope Pacifica releases their full product line in this scent!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite scent by far!</li>
            <li>Anyone who wants a genuine fragrance of coconut should purchase this product.  </li>
            <li>I love it because it&#x27;s everything I expected and more.</li>
            <li>Glad it came in a spray although I keep roll on version in my purse for a quick add on later in the day.  </li>
            <li>I am sensitive to most perfumes but this one I can wear with no negative effect.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the soft scent.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not expensive.</li>
            <li>Pacifica Perfume doesn&#x27;t post any even remotely negative results on their website so be aware you won&#x27;t get a fair review analysis from their site.</li>
            <li>it has a bit more of a cherry smell and less coconut than I expected but its awesome none the less ^.^ thanks.xx</li>
            <li>This is much sweeter than I thought it was going to be.</li>
            <li>and this really smells like it</li>
            <li>We love the scent and goes on with just the right amount of spray to linger a few hours.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that perfumey/soapy chemical smell a lot of other bath products and perfumes have, so I love it.</li>
            <li>So when I saw it on Amazon for several dollars cheaper than the store I was excited.</li>
            <li>I have bought this particular perfume 2x now.</li>
            <li>Most perfumes are much more expensive</li>
            <li>Like most Pacifica scents, it doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li>/&gt;It isn&#x27;t very long lasting (which is fine because I like spraying a bunch on whenever I feel like it) and my mother says that it really does smell like Play-Doh.</li>
            <li>Smells like coconut and vanilla, and very natural too.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t wear many of them anyway because I&#x27;m usually allergic to some of the ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I first got it at Target which only had one promotion set up, and then they stopped carrying it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this scent in general, but smell the spray perfume in person before ordering!</li>
            <li>As long as the price doesn&#x27;t go up too much!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It seems to last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Notes of cherry, vanilla, coconut, vetiver and ambrosia flower, this is a great layering base to amp up the sultriness of other Pacifica fragrances.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t to crazy about the lip balm, it&#x27;s more like a gloss.</li>

            <li> It stays on for a long time and I get compliments when I wear it.  </li>
            <li> When i received the perfume it had a dark yellow tint to it.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely fashion, as expected.</li>
            <li> Shipped faster than expected.</li>
            <li> so she is not inhaling chemicals from other neutral brands on the market.</li>
            <li> This has an odd odor that reminds me (and others) of play-doh.</li>
            <li> It smells a little like toasted coconut --</li>
            <li> I just wish it lasted a little longer on my body.</li>
            <li> The scent seems to stick around a little longer.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wear it because of the weird scent.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> this perfume is terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the scent so much. Wish it lasted longer though.</li>
            <li> Smells like a tropical summer. It&#x27;s just amazing</li>
            <li> I have bought this particular perfume 2x now. It smells a little like toasted coconut -- it&#x27;s not quite sunscreen smell, but it&#x27;s close. I really like it because most people who have smelled it on me have called it &amp;#34;yummy&amp;#34;  -- which I like. It&#x27;s playful and light. Probably good for a younger person. I recommend it though, the scent lasts all day :D</li>
            <li> This has an odd odor that reminds me (and others) of play-doh. its not really unpleasant, but I can&#x27;t wear it because of the weird scent.</li>
            <li> I love it! I only wish the bottle was bigger! It smells fantastic and it&#x27;s the perfect scent for summer.</li>
            <li> Smells like coconut and vanilla, and very natural too. It&#x27;s not that perfumey/soapy chemical smell a lot of other bath products and perfumes have, so I love it. I only gave it four stars since it doesn&#x27;t last a long time. I carry it in my bag to re-spray occasionally if I want. If you like coconut, this is a must! I really hope Pacifica releases their full product line in this scent!</li>
            <li> I love all coconut scents, and this is a pretty good one. Pacifica is a wonderful, ethical brand that I trust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t very long lasting (which is fine because I like spraying a bunch on whenever I feel like it) and my mother says that it really does smell like Play-Doh. This will be a drawback only when I meet someone who does not like the scent of Play-Doh. It still smells like sweet mystical coconuts to me!</li>
            <li> Anyone who wants a genuine fragrance of coconut should purchase this product.  I love it because it&#x27;s everything I expected and more.</li>
            <li> I wear this almost every day, often layering it with another fragrance. It&#x27;s mostly vanilla (which is very nice), with the coconut adding a faint hint of the exotic. Very fresh, clean and sexy in an understated way. Like most Pacifica scents, it doesn&#x27;t last long so I recommend carrying around the solid perfume or the roll-on for touch-ups.</li>
            <li> We love the scent and goes on with just the right amount of spray to linger a few hours. This is a great alternative for my daughter so she is not inhaling chemicals from other neutral brands on the market.</li>
            <li> Love  the fact they are a company that is committed to non-animal testing and use no harmful chemicals. The Indian Coco Nut fragrance is a beautiful summer fragrance.  Come back to it every spring and find it&#x27;s a perfect warm weather  scent.</li>
            <li> Smells like heaven but doesnt stay on too long.. I always get complements</li>
            <li> smells ok if you want to wear something like your vanilla car freshener...lol...i did not return it, i use as air freshener now!</li>
            <li> I cannot get enough. Have to limit myself to 2 sprays since the smell is so wonderful. love love love it.</li>
            <li> this perfume is terrible. i love coconut scents and was looking for a good one that i could wear daily.  As someone else has said...this perfume smells  like cherry cough syrup...also the scent doesnt last long. very cheap smelling...would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to most perfumes but this one I can wear with no negative effect. I enjoy the soft scent. I just wish it lasted a little longer on my body.</li>
            <li> smells like coconut and vanilla my favorite.  I get lots of compliments when I wear it and it&#x27;s not expensive.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent by far! Arrived in a timely fashion, as expected. The only thing I would suggest is a cap for the bottle.</li>
            <li> The scent has zero staying power.  Pacifica Perfume doesn&#x27;t post any even remotely negative results on their website so be aware you won&#x27;t get a fair review analysis from their site. You can try it for yourself, if you don&#x27;t rate a 4 or 5 out of five your review will never appear on pacificaperfume.com. not all products areade in USA eye pencils are one example.</li>
            <li> This is a surprisingly &amp;#34;delicious&amp;#34; smelling perfume and I have lots of compliments every time I wear it.  Most perfumes are much more expensive and I can&#x27;t wear many of them anyway because I&#x27;m usually allergic to some of the ingredients.  So this is a a very good, relatively inexpensive alternative for me.  I first got it at Target which only had one promotion set up, and then they stopped carrying it.  I&#x27;m on my third bottle and buy it from a vendor on Amazon and have been very pleased.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of coconut. I purchased the sample kit and love the roll on perfume and lotion. I wasn&#x27;t to crazy about the lip balm, it&#x27;s more like a gloss.Also the Tuscan Orange Blood smells great I&#x27;m gonna give the body wash a try</li>
            <li> This. Smells. AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I love this and will never use anything else... As long as the price doesn&#x27;t go up too much!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of coconut, and love the smell of this perfume.  If you don&#x27;t enjoy smelling like suntan lotion, you should probably avoid; however, I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li> This goes well with my coconut bath gel, body spray and body lotion.  If you like the smell of coconut then this will work well.</li>
            <li> Notes of cherry, vanilla, coconut, vetiver and ambrosia flower, this is a great layering base to amp up the sultriness of other Pacifica fragrances.  I use the [[ASIN:B005LX73BK Pacifica 8 oz Body Butter Tube - Indian Coconut Nectar]], [[ASIN:B00599SC3E Pacifica Indian Coconut Nectar Body Wash]] and [[ASIN:B004885RQC Pacifica Indian Coconut Nectar Roll-on Perfume]] as a building block for the [[ASIN:B001C55PAC Pacifica Mediterranean Fig Perfume]] and [[ASIN:B001C53IFQ Pacifica Tahitian Gardenia 1.2 oz Tahitian Gardenia Spray Perfume]] but I feel this is too candy sweet to wear alone.  Alone this is a sophisticated version of cherry chapstick and Hawaiian tropic suntan lotion - great for capturing those youthful summer memories but nothing I would want to wear all day.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing scent!!  A very clean and coconutty scent - love it!!</li>
            <li> This is much sweeter than I thought it was going to be. I almost can&#x27;t stand it. The coconut nectar scent just didn&#x27;t mesh well with my skin scent and it came out way too sweet.</li>
            <li> I love the beachy, sweet scent of this perfume.  I own both the roll-on and spray versions, and I have to say I prefer the spray.  The scent seems to stick around a little longer.  The entire Pacifica line is available with samples at Whole Foods, so it was great to be able to smell them all before buying.</li>
            <li> love the smell and sweet coconut air about it. The only problem is that is doesn&#x27;t last. After a short amount of time the smell is gone so I am searching for another longer lasting scent.</li>
            <li> Love this scent!  It stays on for a long time and I get compliments when I wear it.  Glad it came in a spray although I keep roll on version in my purse for a quick add on later in the day.  Shipped faster than expected.</li>
            <li> Love it and can&#x27;t get it in stores anymore</li>
            <li> When i received the perfume it had a dark yellow tint to it. I didn&#x27;t have time to return it since i was leaving to europe the next day but beware.</li>
            <li> Yummy, just wosh it lasted longer</li>
            <li> The Pacifica coconut nectar perfume that my mother in law bought at the store smells beautiful. I tried hers and loved it. So when I saw it on Amazon for several dollars cheaper than the store I was excited. However what I received today in the mail smells like alcohol and it makes my skin burn. I am very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> This arrived only two days after I placed my order and it was shipped! I love the smell of it- it has a bit more of a cherry smell and less coconut than I expected but its awesome none the less ^.^ thanks.xx</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased the solid perfume of this scent and loved it.  The spray perfume I received smelled quite different though.  There is an unmistakeable smell of cough syrup or something similar that has a overly-sweet, medicine smell.  I&#x27;m not sure if this is normally how the spray perfume smells or if I received an old bottle. I highly recommend this scent in general, but smell the spray perfume in person before ordering!</li>
            <li> My husband gets headaches from most perfumes. Luckily he doesn&#x27;t when I wear this! The fragrance is wonderful and summery! The fragrance is lite, so you will want the roll on with you for longer days.</li>
            <li> very lovely, I get complements all the time. It seems to last a long time.  I love coconut and this really smells like it</li>
