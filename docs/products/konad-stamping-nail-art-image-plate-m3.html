            <li>I love this brand of stamping nail art.</li>
            <li>Its all well worth the money!!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to order it, but mine doesn&#x27;t work at all!  </li>
            <li>They never disappoint, will recommend this brand for first time users, stamping is a quick and easy way to create or recreate beautiful nail designs</li>
            <li>It does take some practice but is fairly easy to use.</li>
            <li>Make sure when you are using the plates that you also purchase the Special Konad polish to use with the plates.</li>
            <li>an amazing purchase and exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>The plate is perfectly fine</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re perfect sizing for little fingernails.</li>
            <li>I really like the plate, stamps nicely onto nail and</li>
            <li>I liked them so much when I saw the work she had done that I want to buy some plates</li>
            <li>These designs are great for any teen.</li>
            <li>I really like these designs on this plate especially the hearts and the stars because they are a perfect combination!</li>
            <li>I love these Konad plate took me a while to get it right</li>
            <li>So I got this the mail and was so excited to try it.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for little 2 yr old fingernails.</li>
            <li>She is having fun designing everyone&#x27;s nails.  </li>
            <li>Works great and cute designs I use with the konad nail polishes only my other nail polishes don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a matter of right application.  </li>
            <li>I love stamping with Konad, but this plate really only has one or two usable images.</li>
            <li>the designs are very cute!&lt;br /&gt;Perfect addition to my collection!</li>
            <li>I have used the Konad Nail Art plate and find that they are well made and are shallow enough to get excellent prints to transfer,  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This kit worked reasonably well.</li>
            <li>its so cute and works well with the konad stamp or any other brand of stamps.</li>
            <li>Much better than the other brand I have tried.</li>
            <li>The stencils are deep enough to make a suitable design on the nail.</li>
            <li>The image was a little light on the nail but worked fine and made a complete image for me.</li>
            <li>and I personally prefer the Konad special polish.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for ages 13 and up unless the child has an adult helping them when they first try to learn how to use it.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest it to anyone with children/teens, or even for oneself learning to use nail stamping.</li>
            <li>these work a little better than some of the bundled plates.</li>
            <li>2013 comeptitive season nails are going to be epic thanks to this.</li>
            <li>I used the two tiny flower images and the stars and they turned out pretty.</li>
            <li>but this was my first stamping kit and with no prior experience</li>
            <li>They very deep so the stamps aren&#x27;t very in depth!</li>
            <li>If the image won&#x27;t show up on your stamper, try roughing up the stamper just a little by sanding it with a fine fingernail file.  </li>
            <li>with a three year old daughter and working full time, a simple solid color works for me now.</li>
            <li>Certainly, my least favorite of all the plates.</li>
            <li>My sister has this product (obviously it isn&#x27;t the exact same).  </li>
            <li>I have used the large bow, and I imagine the large flower would work as well, but the remaining images are too small to stamp with clarity.</li>
            <li>Disappointed since my other Konad plates work wonderfully.</li>

            <li> She LOVES it, &amp; I like it because it&#x27;s instantly dry!  </li>
            <li> It was fairly easy but a little tedious to learn how to use.  </li>
            <li> The smaller prints do not show and it is really frustrating to have to keep having to redo the same print.</li>
            <li> images are very small and hard to see from far away, a little trouble getting the image to show up</li>
            <li> and i do not think the designs are too small at all.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s too slick it won&#x27;t pick up the image.</li>
            <li> Totally useless.</li>
            <li> even though now that i think about it it was silly of me to buy plates that were not in a set.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> This product was horrible, I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>

            <li> None of the graphics would print on the nail.  This product was horrible, I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love it. Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> images are very small and hard to see from far away, a little trouble getting the image to show up</li>
            <li> Their plates and designs are really awesome. Make sure when you are using the plates that you also purchase the Special Konad polish to use with the plates. You will get some really great results when you use their special polish. I have tried regular polish with the plates and I personally prefer the Konad special polish. Its all well worth the money!!</li>

            <li> I love stamping with Konad, but this plate really only has one or two usable images. I have used the large bow, and I imagine the large flower would work as well, but the remaining images are too small to stamp with clarity. Even on a child&#x27;s finger, why would they want a spot of paint if no one could tell it was supposed to be a heart? Certainly, my least favorite of all the plates.</li>
            <li> Slightly difficult to use and clean-up is more time consuming that I would like for a nail product.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
            <li> i love it. its so cute and works well with the konad stamp or any other brand of stamps. makes cute designs.</li>
            <li> My sister has this product (obviously it isn&#x27;t the exact same).  I was so excited to order it, but mine doesn&#x27;t work at all!  Very disappointed.  Glad it didn&#x27;t cost a lot, but I sure wish it worked.</li>
            <li> I really like these designs on this plate especially the hearts and the stars because they are a perfect combination! It is a good price as well. Received it earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> I bought this plate for the two star designs but ended up using a lot of the others as well! A really nice stamping plate to have (esp for you star and bow lovers out there)</li>
            <li> It did it&#x27;s job ! Arrived on time.  Works like a charm each and every time it is put to use.</li>
            <li> The image was a little light on the nail but worked fine and made a complete image for me. Much better than the other brand I have tried.</li>
            <li> The original Konad plates are the best.  If the image won&#x27;t show up on your stamper, try roughing up the stamper just a little by sanding it with a fine fingernail file.  If it&#x27;s too slick it won&#x27;t pick up the image.</li>
            <li> I thought I would get Konad since they are a reliable company for nail art plates but this one falls short. Disappointed since my other Konad plates work wonderfully. The designs on this one does not even transfer to the stamper. Totally useless.</li>
            <li> I have used the Konad Nail Art plate and find that they are well made and are shallow enough to get excellent prints to transfer,  This was just too cute!  Thanks</li>
            <li> These, like every thing else I have ordered from this company, are Great!  Stamp Wonderfully!.</li>

            <li> This kit worked reasonably well. I used the two tiny flower images and the stars and they turned out pretty. They do run a bit on the smaller side but this was my first stamping kit and with no prior experience, I would say it was an easy to use kit and the results were good.</li>
            <li> an amazing purchase and exactly what I needed. If only I had gotten it before I left for competition. I paint my nails to match my team&#x27;s leotards at gymnastics meets. 2013 comeptitive season nails are going to be epic thanks to this.</li>
            <li> nice designs for any occasion</li>
            <li> i dont regret buying this plate. even though now that i think about it it was silly of me to buy plates that were not in a set. these work a little better than some of the bundled plates.</li>
            <li> So I got this the mail and was so excited to try it. The designs are so cute. You can use them on the corner of your nail or layer them. I really love it.</li>
            <li> I love these Konad plate took me a while to get it right but I love it... I needed practice practice with these..</li>
            <li> Used a credit card to get the access off. The stencils are deep enough to make a suitable design on the nail. I&#x27;m 27 and to be honest, esp. with a three year old daughter and working full time, a simple solid color works for me now. Cute for teens though.</li>
            <li> This was my very first stamping plate purchase, and after seeing videos on youtube, I knew that getting a &amp;#34;Konad&amp;#34; plate was the best choice.  I am happy with my purchase, and I plan on getting more.</li>

            <li> It took a few tries and some Youtube tutorials, but I figured out how to properly stamp my nails pretty. I&#x27;m a middle school teacher and I get complements all the time and have girls begging me to do there nails... I don&#x27;t of course!</li>
            <li> I gave this plate to my daughter as a part of a Christmas gift, as the matter of fact, I bought her 2, different designs of course!  She loves them, her nails look like salon made!  I liked them so much when I saw the work she had done that I want to buy some plates myself!!!&lt;br /&gt; There is one plate for Christmas nails too!</li>
            <li> GREAT QUALITY, A+,item as described.</li>
