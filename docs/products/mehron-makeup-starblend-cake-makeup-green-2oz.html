            <li>Very good product!</li>
            <li>I dressed as Gamora from Guardians of the Galaxy for Halloween and this makeup was perfect!</li>
            <li>and it was so beautifully pigmented!</li>
            <li>Arrived on time in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>I went as the Wicked Witch of the West and the shade was perfect.  </li>
            <li>got my picture taken more times than I can remember!!!!</li>
            <li>Very very good</li>
            <li>Good makeup!</li>
            <li>I covered my face with a bit of water and this face paint, and it had great coverage.</li>
            <li>Great make-up.</li>
            <li>This is great face paint.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This works great with a smoothy blender, WITHOUT WATER..</li>
            <li>it went on great</li>
            <li>Love it, covers well looks great!!</li>
            <li>Quite good.</li>
            <li>I am using this for Elphaba Thropp for a WICKED production as I can&#x27;t afford the MAC version, and it works just as good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really good color for this.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure which brand to use, but I am extremely happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Used it for Frankenstein at Halloween and liked the fact that it didn&#x27;t streak nor did it go on blotchy.  </li>
            <li>I have used it as an eyeshadow for Halloween and that worked out nicely.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply and easily came off with soap and water.  </li>
            <li>The end result looked pretty good.  </li>
            <li>The top layers will flake off or rub off easily</li>
            <li>Great product, especially for boys faces since they often don&#x27;t like the kind of face paint that goes on wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is also very true to color.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the price and very true to the color in the picture!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s easy to wash</li>
            <li>Easy to wash off as well,</li>
            <li>Also, it came off easily.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good on my skin (very sensitive skin) and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>people thought I was really playing Elphaba!!!</li>
            <li>Other makeup blend/mix well on top of the product nicely too!</li>
            <li>I applied with a makeup sponge starting very lightly and then added more as I went.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased and will look for Mehron in the future.</li>
            <li>Mixed with a bit of water, this is great for a realistic &amp;#34;witch&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t yet speak for the staying power because I&#x27;ve only done test runs, but it looked amazing.</li>
            <li>(If you are having trouble with it because you did use water, google painted party starblend repair and she has a great video on how to fix it.)</li>
            <li>If my face were brushing up against more people then it might have needed touch ups, but it held up much better than I expected.</li>
            <li>We could turn half the school into aliens with this stuff :o)</li>
            <li>You will get a deeper color, better blend, and more coverage if you use a little water on a sponge when applying.</li>
            <li>This is easy to apply and looks professional.</li>
            <li>Just... because it&#x27;s such a fine powder, it gets everywhere!</li>
            <li>This make up survived a hot Halloween in Texas.</li>
            <li>It comes as a powdery cake, kind of like eye shadow and you can use it dry for a more translucent effect or wet for opaque.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much.  </li>
            <li>I think I thought this would be a better coverage when it was wet...</li>
            <li>The makeup is a cake makeup (somewhat like a pressed powder) and very lightweight.</li>
            <li>It applied much better wet.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of layers to get a deep, vibrant color and therefore remains comfortable on the skin.</li>
            <li>Contoured with a bit of white face cream makeup, buffed it together, and it looks very professional and clean.</li>
            <li>Works really well and gets my approval for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this makeup.</li>
            <li>Definitely high quality</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t played with it much, but layering will surely help the transparency wet or dry.</li>
            <li>Also like the fact that I could make it as light or as dark as I cared to.  </li>
            <li>I was really surprised at how well this makeup worked.  </li>
            <li>Great makeup, dried a little darker than expected, but if I had tried it out beforehand wouldn&#x27;t have been an issue.</li>
            <li>The color in the picture is exactly what I get when I use it wet.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;ll say this in case it actually helps someone: This is extremely powdery, thin, and requires a ton of applying to get good coverage.</li>

            <li> so I expected to have to touch up several times but only once in about a nine hour day.  </li>
            <li> It is powder, not liquid, and stays dry.  </li>
            <li> After trying the dry method.</li>
            <li> I wore it for about 7 hours, and I only used a little bit of Mehron&#x27;s antiperspirant setting powder over it.</li>
            <li> I ended up using the wet application method...</li>
            <li> I ended up scooping some out and smashing it into a powder like form and mixing it with a heavy concealer.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Mehron StarBlend Face Paint in Green G for Halloween.</li>
            <li> My daughter needed to look like an alien and this did the trick.  </li>
            <li> You can layer it on thick for an opaque effect or lighter for just a green tint.  </li>
            <li> it was kinda hard to put on, but I am not a make up artist.  </li>
            <li> However, the case arrived broken.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research and was still confused, as I don&#x27;t&#x27; work with colors often at all.</li>

            <li> Love it, covers well looks great!!</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply and easily came off with soap and water.  Used it for Frankenstein at Halloween and liked the fact that it didn&#x27;t streak nor did it go on blotchy.  Also like the fact that I could make it as light or as dark as I cared to.  Very good product!</li>
            <li> I dressed as Gamora from Guardians of the Galaxy for Halloween and this makeup was perfect! I ended up scooping some out and smashing it into a powder like form and mixing it with a heavy concealer. I then applied it with a sponge and it was so beautifully pigmented! I wore the costume to a Halloween party and the makeup stayed on all night. I would highly recommend this makeup. It is well worth the price and very true to the color in the picture!</li>
            <li> Perhaps I am not using it correctly... but this doesn&#x27;t cover and my face broke out after words. I have used it as an eyeshadow for Halloween and that worked out nicely. But I would not recommend it for the face.</li>
            <li> My daughter needed to look like an alien and this did the trick.  I would recommend this.  It doesn&#x27;t take much.  We could turn half the school into aliens with this stuff :o)</li>
            <li> Mixed with a bit of water, this is great for a realistic &amp;#34;witch&amp;#34; skin color. I covered my face with a bit of water and this face paint, and it had great coverage. Contoured with a bit of white face cream makeup, buffed it together, and it looks very professional and clean. Works really well and gets my approval for sensitive skin! Other makeup blend/mix well on top of the product nicely too!</li>
            <li> This make up survived a hot Halloween in Texas. I wore it for about 7 hours, and I only used a little bit of Mehron&#x27;s antiperspirant setting powder over it. If my face were brushing up against more people then it might have needed touch ups, but it held up much better than I expected. It is also very true to color. I put it on in layers to build intensity. I would use this product again.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time in perfect condition. The color in the picture is exactly what I get when I use it wet. It comes as a powdery cake, kind of like eye shadow and you can use it dry for a more translucent effect or wet for opaque. I haven&#x27;t played with it much, but layering will surely help the transparency wet or dry. Very very good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I used it for Calliope from Homestuck)</li>
            <li> Great makeup, dried a little darker than expected, but if I had tried it out beforehand wouldn&#x27;t have been an issue. Definitely high quality and I&#x27;d use this brand again.</li>
            <li> Quite good. They can be applied evenly if you take time and the bottom layers will last. The top layers will flake off or rub off easily but it&#x27;s easy to wash off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only warning is that some of my friends washed their hands after they applied and left their skin yellow for a day. I didn&#x27;t have that problem so it might be a reaction with some soaps.</li>
            <li> Great make-up. I am using this for Elphaba Thropp for a WICKED production as I can&#x27;t afford the MAC version, and it works just as good. However, the case arrived broken. Amazon refunded my money.</li>
            <li> I think I thought this would be a better coverage when it was wet...it was kinda hard to put on, but I am not a make up artist.  Still I won our company costume party (I came as Elphaba) and my make up lasted all day.  It is drying and I couldn&#x27;t wait to get home and take it off.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Mehron StarBlend Face Paint in Green G for Halloween. This is easy to apply and looks professional. You will get a deeper color, better blend, and more coverage if you use a little water on a sponge when applying. I wasn&#x27;t sure which brand to use, but I am extremely happy with this purchase. The makeup is a cake makeup (somewhat like a pressed powder) and very lightweight. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of layers to get a deep, vibrant color and therefore remains comfortable on the skin.</li>
            <li> This is great face paint.  It is powder, not liquid, and stays dry.  You can layer it on thick for an opaque effect or lighter for just a green tint.  I went as the Wicked Witch of the West and the shade was perfect.  Easy to wash off as well, and when I put it on the backs of my hands it didn&#x27;t smear off on everything.  Good makeup!</li>
            <li> I got this to use for my Gamora cosplay. It&#x27;s a really good color for this. I ended up using the wet application method... After trying the dry method. It applied much better wet. I can&#x27;t yet speak for the staying power because I&#x27;ve only done test runs, but it looked amazing.</li>
            <li> Bought this for costuming as SheHulk. I did a lot of research and was still confused, as I don&#x27;t&#x27; work with colors often at all. So, I&#x27;ll say this in case it actually helps someone: This is extremely powdery, thin, and requires a ton of applying to get good coverage. It&#x27;s good on my skin (very sensitive skin) and is easy to clean. Just... because it&#x27;s such a fine powder, it gets everywhere!</li>
            <li> Daughter plan to use for Halloween next year and she approves</li>
            <li> Great product, especially for boys faces since they often don&#x27;t like the kind of face paint that goes on wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works great with a smoothy blender, WITHOUT WATER.. (If you are having trouble with it because you did use water, google painted party starblend repair and she has a great video on how to fix it.)</li>
            <li> I was really surprised at how well this makeup worked.  I am by no means an expert at application so I was a bit hesitant to even try.  I applied with a makeup sponge starting very lightly and then added more as I went.  The end result looked pretty good.  I have very oily skin so I expected to have to touch up several times but only once in about a nine hour day.  Also, it came off easily.  All in all I&#x27;m very pleased and will look for Mehron in the future.</li>
            <li> 5 stars all the way baby!!! it went on great and it last on all night!!!! dress as WICKED from the Broadway show!!! people thought I was really playing Elphaba!!! got my picture taken more times than I can remember!!!!</li>
