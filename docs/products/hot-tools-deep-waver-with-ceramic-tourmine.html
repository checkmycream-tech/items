            <li>Its absolutely fantastic !</li>

            <li>pleased at all that it broke so soon.</li>
            <li>so I was so happy that I could use it and have it actually look good.</li>
            <li>She was doing a tutorial on this product &amp; I fell in love with it just watching how her hair turned out.  </li>
            <li>top of the shipping costs you will be charged another £17 in customs charges.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and works great.</li>
            <li>Better than any I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I love that there is a lock on it.</li>
            <li>i love that it creates beautiful big waves.</li>
            <li>This waver is nice and was great when I had long hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first one I have purchased and it really gives me beautiful waves.</li>
            <li>But it works and its easy to use.tip:</li>
            <li>It also looks great the second day</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy such a great product.</li>
            <li>I always took great care of it, used it only 2 times, kept it underneath the sink.</li>
            <li>Its a great product if you want to have a deep wave in your hair.</li>
            <li>It did a very nice job except I got to use it only twice</li>
            <li>Love my new toy!!!</li>
            <li>I have been growing out my very fine, straight, and now thinning hair in attempt to reach shoulder length for the first time in my 44 years, before I lose any more of it.  </li>
            <li>It gives my VERY VERY straight hair a beautiful lasting wave.  </li>
            <li>It heats up super quick and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Super nice and easy, I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>This waver works much better than a normal triple barrel iron and works a lot faster.  </li>
            <li>my hair is really thick, so i can adjust the heat and get it to the exact heat that will work for my hair and it leaves it beautiful!</li>
            <li>The product heats up fast and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews, but I honestly had given up on ever looking pretty again, and I think I&#x27;ve got a few more good years as long as tools like this are in my arsenal!  ;</li>
            <li>but this large crimp look looks fab!</li>
            <li>It looked like I had literally twice as much hair, and a cool, modern style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend using both a mousse on your wet hair, and then some kind of styling spray before putting the wave in, that seems to help the curl take and hold.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I saw this Deep Waver on youtube from one of the beauty gurus that I love to watch.  </li>
            <li>Things to be aware of if you buy from the USA and want to use this product in the UK:&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>I love this deep waver.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this deep waver.</li>
            <li>it can get extremely hot which will damage and burn your hair like after the 4th time doing it</li>
            <li>I actually burn myself much more easily with the triple barrel than I do with this deep wave iron.  </li>
            <li>I had never even heard of a deep wave iron until I saw my hairdresser wearing these gorgeous, deep, large, bent waves in her hair</li>
            <li>is a very high voltage product,</li>
            <li>I also have a triple barrel iron I picked up at a beauty supply that same day, and it makes tighter S-waves, which look a little frizzier when finished, but I love that, too, since it plumps everything up and masks most of my thinning problem.  </li>
            <li>I can only imagine how fabulous it would be on longer, thicker hair than mine.  </li>
            <li>So I am very dissapointed was of money</li>
            <li>I was surprised; it did crimp!!!</li>
            <li>il super simple &amp;agrave; utiliser ,je l&#x27;ai achet&amp;eacute;</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product...</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMended</li>
            <li>never thought this would work on my very fine hair, or that I would get the results I do as a total amateur, but you can get real salon style with this wave iron.  </li>
            <li>That wave held most of it&#x27;s shape the rest of the day, and half of it through the next day.  </li>
            <li>I have long hair and it looks really pretty and adds a lot of volume and shine to your hair.  </li>
            <li>found that the Toni&amp;Guy one sold in the UK produces the same results and is much cheaper.</li>
            <li>It let me get those curls in my hair that I always strive for with my regular curling iron in way less than half the time, and my hair looked better too.  </li>
            <li>You may still need to do a little &#x27;something&#x27; for the roots (single iron or just a volume-enhancing blow dry) if you have fine hair like  </li>
            <li>Works great on all hair, short, long, thin, thick...</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Its absolutely fantastic ! Warming up quickly and making a beautiful beach waves, adding a super shine to your hair. Very happy I bought it.</li>
            <li> Love this!  It let me get those curls in my hair that I always strive for with my regular curling iron in way less than half the time, and my hair looked better too.  You may still need to do a little &#x27;something&#x27; for the roots (single iron or just a volume-enhancing blow dry) if you have fine hair like  I do, because this doesn&#x27;t get quite close enough to your scalp to get volume there, but it&#x27;s still a great, great product.</li>
            <li> Amazing!  Works great on all hair, short, long, thin, thick...an all around great product. This waver works much better than a normal triple barrel iron and works a lot faster.  It also looks great the second day (I actually prefer it that way!)</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and not only did it take forever to ship she used it once and it just shut off and won&#x27;t work. Very disappointed in this product to say the least!!</li>
            <li> Love my new toy!!! Creates amazing waves that hold all day and adds a nice shine to your hair! If you&#x27;re looking for beautiful beach waves, look no further, this is a great product!</li>
            <li> I have to tell you that i have tried many wavers, and this one is by far the best one i have tried.. my hair is really thick, so i can adjust the heat and get it to the exact heat that will work for my hair and it leaves it beautiful! I highly recommend this product...</li>
            <li> I purchased the deep waver as a Christmas gift for my 2 teenage daughters.  They LOVE it!  It heats up super quick and is easy to use. They found it is best to separate your hair, top and bottom layer. Pin the top hair up and wave the bottom hair, then do the outer top layer.  The waves hold super good.  They look great even after a night of sleep.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy such a great product.</li>
            <li> I am not pleased that this item stopped working after only about 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;I turn it on and it does not heat up. I always took great care of it, used it only 2 times, kept it underneath the sink. Besides it not working now, when it did work, it worked great. I loved the waves that it added to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Not pleased at all that it broke so soon.</li>
            <li> I love this thing!  I had never even heard of a deep wave iron until I saw my hairdresser wearing these gorgeous, deep, large, bent waves in her hair that made her look a little 1940s glam.  I have been growing out my very fine, straight, and now thinning hair in attempt to reach shoulder length for the first time in my 44 years, before I lose any more of it.  Blown out straight with a brush, even with the color and highlight body boost, it still just looks limp and stringy, the reality of my genetics and hormones, I guess.  I asked my stylist to hit it with the iron she used on her hair, and I could not believe the difference.  That wave held most of it&#x27;s shape the rest of the day, and half of it through the next day.  It looked like I had literally twice as much hair, and a cool, modern style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This iron was the closest I could find to what she used on me, and it seems to recreate the look, though it&#x27;s tricky doing the back on myself.  I also have a triple barrel iron I picked up at a beauty supply that same day, and it makes tighter S-waves, which look a little frizzier when finished, but I love that, too, since it plumps everything up and masks most of my thinning problem.  I actually burn myself much more easily with the triple barrel than I do with this deep wave iron.  I&#x27;d recommend using both a mousse on your wet hair, and then some kind of styling spray before putting the wave in, that seems to help the curl take and hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never thought this would work on my very fine hair, or that I would get the results I do as a total amateur, but you can get real salon style with this wave iron.  I can only imagine how fabulous it would be on longer, thicker hair than mine.  I rarely write reviews, but I honestly had given up on ever looking pretty again, and I think I&#x27;ve got a few more good years as long as tools like this are in my arsenal!  ;</li>
            <li> il super simple &amp;agrave; utiliser ,je l&#x27;ai achet&amp;eacute; pour une utilisation en France donc besoin d&#x27;un adaptateur mais tr&amp;egrave;s facile &amp;agrave; trouver ici !! sinon je le recommande , il est super !!</li>
            <li> Simply put.. Even a caveman can do it. Easiest tool, I suck at styling my hair/ doing anything to it besides up in a ponytail so I was so happy that I could use it and have it actually look good. I suck at using curling irons too. Must have!</li>
            <li> This is the best new hair product in a while!  It gives my VERY VERY straight hair a beautiful lasting wave.  I can sleep on it and brush it out the next day and it&#x27;s still beautiful!</li>
            <li> I saw this Deep Waver on youtube from one of the beauty gurus that I love to watch.  She was doing a tutorial on this product &amp; I fell in love with it just watching how her hair turned out.  I have long hair and it looks really pretty and adds a lot of volume and shine to your hair.  I don&#x27;t really like the small crimpers but this large crimp look looks fab!</li>
            <li> Things to be aware of if you buy from the USA and want to use this product in the UK:&lt;br /&gt;On top of the shipping costs you will be charged another £17 in customs charges.&lt;br /&gt;This is a very high voltage product, 300 watts so you will also require a voltage converter to cover this amount which if you do not already have one can set you back another £30 to £40!!&lt;br /&gt;I found that the Toni&amp;Guy one sold in the UK produces the same results and is much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I love this deep waver. It&#x27;s the first one I have purchased and it really gives me beautiful waves. I recommend hair spray or mouse (preferably with heat protection)so the waves remain in place for a longer period. Also don&#x27;t leave this on a surface that can burn while it&#x27;s on. I left it on my bed and it burned it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this deep waver. Heats up fast and works great. Better than any I have ever used. Definitely get this.</li>
            <li> this is a 1 of a kind product! it gives perfect waves! especially if you have a long hair! HIGHLY RECOMMended</li>
            <li> I have long Asian straight hair and it has been super difficult when crimping or curling it. I wanted to try this  product to see if it can crimp my hair. I was surprised; it did crimp!!! And the best thing of them all, the curls lasted all night. I love this product! The product heats up fast and is easy to use. I love that there is a lock on it. Its a great product if you want to have a deep wave in your hair. Super nice and easy, I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> It did a very nice job except I got to use it only twice and the thing wouldn&#x27;t heat up no more completely stoped working, and I had it for one month  and don&#x27;t have the receipt to exchange it. So I am very dissapointed was of money</li>
            <li> Estou muito satisfeita não s&amp;oacute; com o produto que comprei na Amazon.con, que de fato &amp;eacute; perfeito, mas tamb&amp;eacute;m pela seriedade que vocês tratam seus clientes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moro no Brasil, na cidade de Recife, foi a primeira vez que comprei em um site fora do Brsil e estou impressionada com a eficiência de vocês.O produto chegou antes de informado o que me deixou extremamente feliz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indico a Amazon.con a todos, e com certeza este &amp;eacute; o in&amp;iacute;cio de uma eterna relação.</li>
            <li> i love that it creates beautiful big waves. the downside of that is that it burns your hair like crazy!!! it can get extremely hot which will damage and burn your hair like after the 4th time doing it (yea its that bad) it gives your hair a disgusting burnt smell as well. But it works and its easy to use.tip: buy heat protection spray for your hair.</li>
            <li> This waver is nice and was great when I had long hair. If you have short hair it doesnt work because the waves are to big .</li>
