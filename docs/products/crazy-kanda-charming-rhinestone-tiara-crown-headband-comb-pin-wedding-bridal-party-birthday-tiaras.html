            <li>Much more than expected, the tiara was simply beautiful.  </li>
            <li>but the crown was bueatiful however cheaply made cuz</li>
            <li>Great quality - really big!</li>
            <li>We used this for homecoming queen, and it is absolutely beautiful, it&#x27;s quite heavy, and better made than crowns</li>
            <li>I know that this will be well received &amp; it was well worth the $!</li>
            <li>It is well assembled and is large and beautiful yet not too big that it will fall off or be unbalanced on a teens head.  </li>
