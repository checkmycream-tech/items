            <li> This is the BEST BB cream for WOC with brown or deep skin tones!  I plan to get all the colors at some point :) I was unsure which color to get as this product is N/A in local stores for me.  So I got Medium Dark first and loved it for the summer!  The Medium Dark has more of a red undertone which is amazing and gives my skin a natural glow! It did not really look like makeup either.  People complimented my skin not my makeup and I have hyperpigmentation from acne scars.  Eventually, I also purchased Medium and Light Medium as well.  Medium is a match for me now as the weather has gotten colder.  I love how the BB cream can provide full coverage and does not show up ashy.  You don&#x27;t need much--a little goes a long way. Will definitely be stocking up on these BB creams!  I would have never wasted all the $ I spent on Dermablends, Lancôme, CG, Maybelline, etc. This gives the best coverage for a fraction of the price!  I should gotten this a LONG time ago....</li>
            <li> Good coverage but I wish I could find a product  with a better oil control feature. Also I don&#x27;t care for the red undertone in the color but I know some people may prefer it.</li>
            <li> Very good just what I needed</li>
            <li> Will order just the dark next time because the med/dark was too light for me. I do like the coverage and texture of this product.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!!!!</li>
            <li> First, it is very difficult to find a bb cream for dark complexion let alone multifunction.  Ruby Kiss has hit the mark without the added oil.</li>
            <li> I like how it covers and a little goes a long way. I don&#x27;t like that it rubs off easily.</li>
            <li> I like this bb cream and before this I wasn&#x27;t really sold on the power of bb creams. But this bb cream is amazing. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or sticky. It does conceal and provide a smooth surface for the foundation. I apply it with an angled foundation brush and blend it in real good. Sometimes I even just wear it by itself with pressed powder, bc it is medium to full coverage, and it&#x27;s buildable. Also a lot goes a long way. Truly a dime sized amount will cover your whole face. I got it in shade medium/dark, but I think medium would have been best for me. Bc my skin is just a shade lighter. Over all I&#x27;d say get it! You will be pleased!</li>
            <li> love the color. Great for summer, coverage light to medium</li>
            <li> I absolutely Love this product. I&#x27;ve tryed so many that did not live up to their claims. This product is everything they say it is. I have very dry sensitive skin. This doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin its Moisturizing without being heavy and coverage is great. It last throughout the day with minimal retouching. Try it you won&#x27;t regret it!!!!</li>
            <li> Really really good bb.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, this product  blends in very well with my skin color and it&#x27;s you&#x27;re not so shinny..</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product. The price can&#x27;t be beat. It&#x27;s perfect for my skin tone, and it&#x27;s better than any high-end brand BB cream out there, and gives you more product. I&#x27;d pay twice as much as the retail amount for this product. It&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> Light and coverful concealer and foundation in one.</li>
            <li> Love it.. Blends with my skin perfectly</li>
            <li> Best coverage using this product. I receive many compliments every time I wear it. No need for other products, it gives full coverage concealing my dark heads &amp; has a smooth finish. It blends in so well with my skin making me look like I have naturally glowy even skin tone. Love the dewy finish. Love love everything about this product. The best I&#x27;ve used by far. Shipped in a timely manner. Would definitely  recommend.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much, but gave it a low rating due to the price gauging. Go on EBAY and buy it for $9.00 w/ free shipping! I can&#x27;t stand venders that over charge items they know are not that expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I digressed, back to the review.  The shade I purchased was Med-Dark, and it matched my skin tone (I&#x27;m a NW43 - NW45  in MAC foundations &amp;178 in MUFE HD foundation) perfectly! This product is light weight &amp; very versatile because you can wear it alone w/ or w/o a setting powder, or as a primer.  I use this product to camouflage my under-eye dark circles. I layer it gradually and blend with my fingers until I achieve the coverage I desire. I then set it with a finely milled powder and complete my face regime.</li>
            <li> oh my this BB cream can double as a foundation,its nice you can wear it alone with out powder and foundation and its works wonders but in order for it to last you may need to get a fix it spray from sacha or NYX and you are good to go.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a lover of BB creams ..Because I. Can&#x27;t always wear my good stuff everyday.. I got medium to dark and this is worth every dime.. Will order again!!!</li>
            <li> I read so many reviews on this bb cream and at first I was so excited to purchase but it was a total disappointment for me. I got this in a medium dark and It looked like a dark to me. The few times I applied it on my face I ended up looking like a greasy mess. I have oily skin so you can imagine how greasy I looked, I looked like I just dipped myself in oil. There is this weird red undertone to this bb cream that just did not look flattering at all. I would recommend it if you&#x27;re into looking dewy but for me it&#x27;s a no.</li>
            <li> I wear this in the summer because it&#x27;s so light, yet has enough coverage to look like foundation. Definitely stocking up!!</li>
            <li> I like that I got it on time and the color go&#x27;s good on my skin color you have to pick your skin color for it to look good on your face</li>
            <li> This bb cream is so perfect, it has a thick but not too thick consistancy, leave a great satin skin like finish, it has like medium to full coverage. It&#x27;s very buildable and it just makes me look radiant!&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised because most bb creams especially for us darker skinned women have very little coverage it don&#x27;t come in our shade. I got the medium dark shade and it&#x27;s perfect it literally turns the color of my skin when I put it on. I threw out my foundation I&#x27;m only going to use this! I&#x27;ll need to order some more soon&lt;br /&gt;I LOVVVEEE IT</li>
