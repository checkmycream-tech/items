            <li>but it could be better....</li>
            <li>Sponge works well and is holding up pretty good.</li>
            <li>Loved it so much I bought another one!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very cool sponge butt</li>
            <li>I prefer to use a gel or light pomade for better hold.</li>
            <li>Perfect works as expected!</li>
            <li>it breaks apart easily</li>
            <li>It came so quick!</li>

            <li>The sponge is comfortable and didn&#x27;t cause my hair to become entangled.</li>

            <li>but it&#x27;s still worth five stars</li>
            <li>I used it immediately and saw r2esults right away.</li>
            <li>Definitely works best with hair that is slightly damp.  </li>

            <li>Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li>Gets the job done real talk</li>
            <li>I found that the sponge worked on my sons hair which is much shorter than mine, but it did not work on my length of hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>

            <li>Really did the job..</li>
            <li>it really works...</li>
            <li>Well I only had about 2 1/2 inches of hair on my head and it had fun tugging at the bit of hair I had.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s twisted the hair good in certain places</li>
            <li>We already have to order a new one</li>
            <li>the product does exactly what is expected, my teenage son loves it!</li>
            <li>I wish the top of the sponge wasn&#x27;t a cut out After a couple of week&#x27;s of use the sponge started to crumble, leaving behind tiny pieces of the material in my hair.</li>
