            <li>The smells are amazing.</li>
            <li>have to say that sweetsation customer service is amazing.  </li>
            <li>but this product is really nice.</li>
            <li>It feels so nice to apply, if I could</li>
            <li>AND IT SMELLS GOOD, COULD ASK FOR A BETTER TONER</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a nice toner</li>
            <li>WHat is also nice is that the company does not promise miricales like most companies.</li>
            <li>Toner (the best toner ever used, clearly minimises pores)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can feel the ingredients working right away, and it&#x27;s great to know that they are all organic and healthy.  </li>
            <li>very light smell &amp;</li>
            <li>One does NOT notice remarkable results right away.  </li>
            <li>a huge fan and am so pleased I found this skin care line!</li>
            <li>The toner feels great going on and is not over drying which is great since I started using it in December when the air is very dry.  </li>
            <li>I just started using this product, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>The toner is a refreshing addition to my face washing regimen.</li>
            <li>Applying the toner is probably my favorite part of washing my face.</li>
            <li>and I am glad I stumbled along this company.</li>
            <li>It makes my girl&#x27;s face more brighter and clearer.</li>
            <li>I love this toner.</li>
            <li>I ordered this toner because I love so many products in this line</li>
            <li>Truly enjoying taking care of my skin.</li>
            <li>YUMMY LOVE</li>
            <li>THE SMELL LOVE</li>
            <li>To make matters better, the toner is organic.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get any better than that.</li>
            <li>does a way better job than wasting money on these products.</li>
            <li>like the sweetsation line products and will buy more of them.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love their products.</li>
            <li>Their customer service is also top notch.</li>
            <li>I recently reordered the serum, like I said before, their company if spectacular!!!!</li>
            <li>Granted the ingredients are gentler and more preferable in this product.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>I really love this toner which makes my face evenly toned</li>
            <li>I began noticing my skin looking and feeling better, almost immediately after I began using their products.</li>
            <li>also really really love this product because it is organic.</li>
            <li>The smell is wonderfully refreshing and cooling.</li>
            <li>However, after thoroughly reviewing all the reviews on sweetsation products, I have decided to give it a go, and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I am so looking forward to trying more Sweetsation Therapy organic products.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend all the Sweetsation products to every woman who is looking for great skin products without all the chemicals.</li>
            <li>This toner is awesome - my skin looks healthier and younger since I&#x27;ve been using the Sweetsation products and the toner is a huge part of that equation.  </li>
            <li>I use it daily as part of my skin care routine, along with the Lumi*Essence, I*light and moisturizer with sunscreen (which smells lightly and delightfully like chocolate).  </li>
            <li>I have used so many products in my life and this product if by far the best ther is out in the world of do it your self at home, hahaha.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The most important factors about these products are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(Extremely, important when many jobs are going overseas.  </li>
            <li>This is an awesome tonic for someone like me who is looking for products that are environmental friendly and gentle and pure for the skin.  </li>
            <li>(Such an overwhelming joy to use)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely cool to even be able to  make a statement like that.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t thank you enough for your beautiful line and the lifetime of irritation and eczema that they soothe and take away, even throughout my pregnancy.</li>
            <li>My skin is super sensitive to break outs, and I am just so happy this has not made me break out and</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this toner after washing my face.  </li>
            <li>free skin care  products for a while and found Sweetsation and decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>The Vitamin C helps fight free radicals and sun damage.</li>
            <li>I can tell when I skip this step because the rest of my regime does not go on as smoothly as it should.</li>
            <li>I use this with the Lumi*Essence Organic Advanced Skin Brightening / Whitening Repair Treatment</li>
            <li>IT FEELS SMOOTH</li>
            <li>I like this alcohol free organic product.</li>
            <li>I like that the products are made with great, all-natural ingredients and the fact that they actually work.</li>
            <li>Its really good to see that the products offered are for your health, naturally derived, with no gimmicks.</li>
            <li>For a year I was looking for good natural toners for my teenager.</li>
            <li>So far so good,</li>
            <li>am really happy with my purchase and going to try more of their other products too.</li>
            <li>The texture is very light, which is great for summer, but I think a little bit too light in colder seasons.</li>
            <li>Best of all, I am reassured that this toner is good for me and my skin with its all natural ingredients and organic qualities, none of the harsh chemicals that get absorbed into my bloodstream.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased this when I found out</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I recommend this toner 100% over the many others I have tried simply because this one is effective on doing what a toner is suppose to do.</li>
            <li>my skin felt clean, refreshed, and even hydrated.  </li>
            <li>feeling fresh &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>It is 3/4 full and opened.</li>
            <li>When i tried this toner my skin felt fresh , clean .</li>
            <li>I was pregnant, but I plan to continue using this line even after the bambino arrives....</li>
            <li>Judging from the level content in the bottle, I can &#x27;guesstimate&#x27; it to last me two (2) more months, perhaps even more.</li>
            <li>This toner is very gentle, non-drying, lightly scented and well-absorbed.  </li>
            <li>From the very first time I applied this product to my face</li>
            <li>I will be ordering my third bottle as I am very satisfied with this toner.</li>
            <li>I have been buying this toner for the last 2 years or so and love it!  </li>
            <li>My face is getting supple and smooth without large pores.</li>
            <li>I found what I need, and that is the same as what most woman need; a product that works and is healthy, a product that can be used for a very long time and not cause harm but give nice results.</li>
            <li>but since I start gently wiping over my skin with the toner, my FACE SKIN is BRIGHTER, CLEANER, CLEARER, FREE from ACNE,!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>What the company does promise is healthy products, and they are quite possibly the healthiest available.</li>
            <li>Research proves this</li>
            <li>When I received my item, I also received a couple free samples of their other items, which I thought was nice.</li>
            <li>It immediately makes my face feel so clean, smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>Love this product so far and hope it keep doing wonders to my skin like I believe it will after what I&#x27;ve experienced in the past 2 days alone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And my face looks clean and glowing because the toner lighten blemishes and brighten my whole face and neck</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice anything special</li>
            <li>I see no difference whatsoever from this product other than it works ok for making sure all my makeup came off and my skin is ok to apply my next steps.</li>
            <li>If you are on the fence, definitely give it a try, it is worth it :)</li>
            <li>I think I have tried everything on the market, but the first time I used this product, I knew it was for me.  </li>
            <li>The face foam I use first then apply this toner with a cotton ball or cotton pad</li>
            <li>I really like this toner!</li>
            <li>So I read several articles that stated that Vitamin C was healthy for your skin and was looking for an introduction product to start me on my path.</li>
            <li>This is the first one that doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write reviews generally speaking, but I couldn&#x27;t resist due to the joy these products have brought to my life and the fact that all the company activities are founded and based in United States of America.  </li>
            <li>I used to only use a face wash and face lotion and now decided to add a toner and serum, and am so glad I picked this toner because I am very prone to acne and have pretty oily skin.</li>
            <li>I use the toner and it makes my skin feels so clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and get break-out so easily from what I use.&lt;br /&gt;This is gentle but keeps my skin soft and clear.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>This item seemed to have lots of positive reviews and was in my price range, so I decided to give it a shot.</li>
            <li>I am confident that I will continue using this product for a LONG time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I do have dry skin, so it probably won&#x27;t be any problem for most people.</li>
            <li>and I can really see a difference, immedietly perks up my skin and brightens it.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>Very Berry face Scrub</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice and difference or improvement with this product.</li>
            <li>I ordered lots of products for her, but it didn&#x27;t work very well untill meeting C*Bella Organic Toner.</li>
            <li>We really like this product.</li>
            <li>It shrank my pores, and brightened my complexion leaving me with a very youthful glow.</li>
            <li>I like it so much because it works so well on brightening my face and reducing enlarged pores.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fast; I did not expect it.</li>
            <li>I also have very acne prone skin and these products don&#x27;t cause me to break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t see much of a difference or improvement with my skin from using this product.</li>
            <li>This is really working.</li>
            <li>I see my face much clearer now.  </li>
            <li>It is light colored when you just open the bottle and gets darker after a while.  </li>
            <li>Two of the most important are that your health will not be affected, if anything improved, and they last longer that other products that you need twice as much.</li>
            <li>I use this toner along with other sweetsation products and I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>I had some problems with my order in the past and the owner of the company went above and beyond to make sure I was satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I started using it about a month ago and still have a lot left, a lot goes a really long way which is nice to see.</li>
            <li>use C*Bella products only and this line is more economical than other organic products I bought from Wholefoods.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>Face Wash (lovely, simple and plentiful - will last for months on end)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>I had never used a toner until purchasing this and now, I will never be without this particular one.  </li>
            <li>I have only used it for two days now, morning and before bed, and have to say this leaves my skin feeling so clean and soft!</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t want to buy a toner with alcohol because I&#x27;ve heard it is bad for your skin, so when I read the ingredients I was very excited to see all the good and natural stuff in this product!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and will buy it again.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I have olive skin, my pigmentation is high.</li>
            <li>I need little bit more materialization&lt;</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and is super gentle.</li>
            <li>My skin felt soft &amp; hydrated,  and ready for Q*Lumière Organic Day crème with Cucumber.</li>
            <li>They are very patient and answered all my questions professionally.</li>
            <li>I am not all into ant-aging and the normal woman stuff</li>
            <li>(clinique 7 day daily scrub cleanser) and evening cleanses and my face always feels so fresh and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li>It smelled nice and did not affect my skin negatively which is always a plus.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Afterwards I do my normal care</li>
            <li>I have better skin tone after using this for a month everyday.</li>
            <li>Her skin is easily irrupted and has lots of blemish, dark pore.</li>
            <li>(I also wish that I&#x27;d received some free samples of other Sweetsation Therapy products like some here have mentioned that they have received)</li>
            <li>Again, if you are looking for a new skincare regime, please give these products a try.  </li>
            <li>I have only been using this product for about 2-3 weeks, but if the ingredients are any indicator, I should be seeing good results within a few months of daily cleansing.</li>
            <li>This toner helped to not only exfoliate and deep clean</li>
            <li>the toner works very well and does not dry out your skin.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is huge and will last for a very long time.  </li>
            <li>I especially needed it for my nose area which has a lot of large pores.  </li>
            <li>Little bit light texture.  </li>
            <li>I had been looking for natural and preservative( paraben and phalates )</li>
            <li>I have to say for ordering this product so far for one week of use i can notice the difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have not had any problems using sweetsationtherapy.  </li>
            <li>It smells natural.</li>
            <li>My skin used to be so sensitive and adult acne prone.</li>
            <li>far I like it.</li>
            <li>actually seems to be really helping my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve decided that toners go very well with my facial routine</li>
            <li>Skin Brightener (Slow, safe and effective)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend</li>
            <li>My skin has never been so fresh and moisturized without the burning/stinging feeling I get from other products.</li>
            <li>I do understand that fine products come in small quantities, but-</li>
            <li>the fact that it is all natural is a major bonus in my book.  </li>
            <li>The cost is worth the freedom from skin irritation and unpredictable results from retail products on grocery or drug store shelves.</li>
            <li>way I use the toner is, I put the toner on 2 circle cotton and gently wipe your face all over through neck every single day and night.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I barely leave reviews for products</li>
            <li>i am big fan of natural organic products .</li>
            <li>I noticed the difference in my skin when I was going through my photos on my phone, where I really noticed that my skin brightened and my dark spots disappeared from old photos to recent ones.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty good skin, which I often receive compliments on, but I had a little bit of uneven skin tone with small dark spots on my forehead, and they have completely vanished.  </li>
            <li>As a male, it can be difficult to find an effective toner.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and sometimes toners will dry my skin out and/or irritate it.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I have always been hesitant to purchase skin products because it is so difficult to find products that actually do what they promise, not to mention that it is such a hassle to return them online.</li>
            <li>I apply the C*Bella after cleansing my face and neck with pure Black soap w/shea butter.</li>

            <li> I think skin turns to bright.  </li>
            <li> good to use with either day or night cream.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and loved the \\&quot;C*Bella Organic Brightening Toner with Vitamin C and Enzymes\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to use this toner before I apply the day cream on face.</li>
            <li> my aesthetician I see once a month says I have good regime to take care of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This toner is very effective and does a great job removing any dirt or makeup that my cleanser wasn&#x27;t able to take off.</li>
            <li> The smell is beautiful and I love the way it feels when I put it on my face.</li>
            <li> All the sweet sensation products are awesome.</li>
            <li> Love that it is organic and it smells great.  </li>
            <li> This is yet another Sweetsation Therapy product I am very pleased with...</li>
            <li> and I am very pleased with this.</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> I am so in love with their products!</li>
            <li> so luxuriously healthy!</li>
            <li> I love it!.</li>
            <li> and when I started using the Sweetsation Therapy products and I saw all the amazing reviews about the toner I thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> The results are amazing.  </li>
            <li> The smells are amazing.</li>
            <li> have to say that sweetsation customer service is amazing.  </li>
            <li> but this product is really nice.</li>
            <li> It feels so nice to apply, if I could</li>
            <li> AND IT SMELLS GOOD, COULD ASK FOR A BETTER TONER</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a nice toner</li>
            <li> WHat is also nice is that the company does not promise miricales like most companies.</li>
            <li> Toner (the best toner ever used, clearly minimises pores)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can feel the ingredients working right away, and it&#x27;s great to know that they are all organic and healthy.  </li>
            <li> very light smell &amp;</li>
            <li> One does NOT notice remarkable results right away.  </li>
            <li> a huge fan and am so pleased I found this skin care line!</li>
            <li> The toner feels great going on and is not over drying which is great since I started using it in December when the air is very dry.  </li>
            <li> I just started using this product, and I love it.  </li>
            <li> The toner is a refreshing addition to my face washing regimen.</li>
            <li> Applying the toner is probably my favorite part of washing my face.</li>
            <li> and I am glad I stumbled along this company.</li>
            <li> It makes my girl&#x27;s face more brighter and clearer.</li>
            <li> I love this toner.</li>
            <li> I ordered this toner because I love so many products in this line</li>
            <li> Truly enjoying taking care of my skin.</li>
            <li> YUMMY LOVE</li>
            <li> THE SMELL LOVE</li>
            <li> To make matters better, the toner is organic.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get any better than that.</li>
            <li> does a way better job than wasting money on these products.</li>
            <li> like the sweetsation line products and will buy more of them.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love their products.</li>
            <li> Their customer service is also top notch.</li>
            <li> I recently reordered the serum, like I said before, their company if spectacular!!!!</li>
            <li> Granted the ingredients are gentler and more preferable in this product.</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> I really love this toner which makes my face evenly toned</li>
            <li> I began noticing my skin looking and feeling better, almost immediately after I began using their products.</li>
            <li> also really really love this product because it is organic.</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderfully refreshing and cooling.</li>
            <li> However, after thoroughly reviewing all the reviews on sweetsation products, I have decided to give it a go, and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I am so looking forward to trying more Sweetsation Therapy organic products.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend all the Sweetsation products to every woman who is looking for great skin products without all the chemicals.</li>
            <li> This toner is awesome - my skin looks healthier and younger since I&#x27;ve been using the Sweetsation products and the toner is a huge part of that equation.  </li>
            <li> I use it daily as part of my skin care routine, along with the Lumi*Essence, I*light and moisturizer with sunscreen (which smells lightly and delightfully like chocolate).  </li>
            <li> I have used so many products in my life and this product if by far the best ther is out in the world of do it your self at home, hahaha.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The most important factors about these products are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Extremely, important when many jobs are going overseas.  </li>
            <li> This is an awesome tonic for someone like me who is looking for products that are environmental friendly and gentle and pure for the skin.  </li>
            <li> (Such an overwhelming joy to use)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely cool to even be able to  make a statement like that.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t thank you enough for your beautiful line and the lifetime of irritation and eczema that they soothe and take away, even throughout my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> My skin is super sensitive to break outs, and I am just so happy this has not made me break out and</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this toner after washing my face.  </li>
            <li> free skin care  products for a while and found Sweetsation and decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> The Vitamin C helps fight free radicals and sun damage.</li>
            <li> I can tell when I skip this step because the rest of my regime does not go on as smoothly as it should.</li>
            <li> I use this with the Lumi*Essence Organic Advanced Skin Brightening / Whitening Repair Treatment</li>
            <li> IT FEELS SMOOTH</li>
            <li> I like this alcohol free organic product.</li>
            <li> I like that the products are made with great, all-natural ingredients and the fact that they actually work.</li>
            <li> Its really good to see that the products offered are for your health, naturally derived, with no gimmicks.</li>
            <li> For a year I was looking for good natural toners for my teenager.</li>
            <li> So far so good,</li>
            <li> am really happy with my purchase and going to try more of their other products too.</li>
            <li> The texture is very light, which is great for summer, but I think a little bit too light in colder seasons.</li>
            <li> Best of all, I am reassured that this toner is good for me and my skin with its all natural ingredients and organic qualities, none of the harsh chemicals that get absorbed into my bloodstream.  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased this when I found out</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I recommend this toner 100% over the many others I have tried simply because this one is effective on doing what a toner is suppose to do.</li>
            <li> my skin felt clean, refreshed, and even hydrated.  </li>
            <li> feeling fresh &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> It is 3/4 full and opened.</li>
            <li> When i tried this toner my skin felt fresh , clean .</li>
            <li> I was pregnant, but I plan to continue using this line even after the bambino arrives....</li>
            <li> Judging from the level content in the bottle, I can &#x27;guesstimate&#x27; it to last me two (2) more months, perhaps even more.</li>
            <li> This toner is very gentle, non-drying, lightly scented and well-absorbed.  </li>
            <li> From the very first time I applied this product to my face</li>
            <li> I will be ordering my third bottle as I am very satisfied with this toner.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this toner for the last 2 years or so and love it!  </li>
            <li> My face is getting supple and smooth without large pores.</li>
            <li> I found what I need, and that is the same as what most woman need; a product that works and is healthy, a product that can be used for a very long time and not cause harm but give nice results.</li>
            <li> but since I start gently wiping over my skin with the toner, my FACE SKIN is BRIGHTER, CLEANER, CLEARER, FREE from ACNE,!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> What the company does promise is healthy products, and they are quite possibly the healthiest available.</li>
            <li> Research proves this</li>
            <li> When I received my item, I also received a couple free samples of their other items, which I thought was nice.</li>
            <li> It immediately makes my face feel so clean, smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> Love this product so far and hope it keep doing wonders to my skin like I believe it will after what I&#x27;ve experienced in the past 2 days alone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And my face looks clean and glowing because the toner lighten blemishes and brighten my whole face and neck</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice anything special</li>
            <li> I see no difference whatsoever from this product other than it works ok for making sure all my makeup came off and my skin is ok to apply my next steps.</li>
            <li> If you are on the fence, definitely give it a try, it is worth it :)</li>
            <li> I think I have tried everything on the market, but the first time I used this product, I knew it was for me.  </li>
            <li> The face foam I use first then apply this toner with a cotton ball or cotton pad</li>
            <li> I really like this toner!</li>
            <li> So I read several articles that stated that Vitamin C was healthy for your skin and was looking for an introduction product to start me on my path.</li>
            <li> This is the first one that doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews generally speaking, but I couldn&#x27;t resist due to the joy these products have brought to my life and the fact that all the company activities are founded and based in United States of America.  </li>
            <li> I used to only use a face wash and face lotion and now decided to add a toner and serum, and am so glad I picked this toner because I am very prone to acne and have pretty oily skin.</li>
            <li> I use the toner and it makes my skin feels so clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and get break-out so easily from what I use.&lt;br /&gt;This is gentle but keeps my skin soft and clear.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> This item seemed to have lots of positive reviews and was in my price range, so I decided to give it a shot.</li>
            <li> I am confident that I will continue using this product for a LONG time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I do have dry skin, so it probably won&#x27;t be any problem for most people.</li>
            <li> and I can really see a difference, immedietly perks up my skin and brightens it.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Very Berry face Scrub</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice and difference or improvement with this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered lots of products for her, but it didn&#x27;t work very well untill meeting C*Bella Organic Toner.</li>
            <li> We really like this product.</li>
            <li> It shrank my pores, and brightened my complexion leaving me with a very youthful glow.</li>
            <li> I like it so much because it works so well on brightening my face and reducing enlarged pores.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s fast; I did not expect it.</li>
            <li> I also have very acne prone skin and these products don&#x27;t cause me to break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t see much of a difference or improvement with my skin from using this product.</li>
            <li> This is really working.</li>
            <li> I see my face much clearer now.  </li>
            <li> It is light colored when you just open the bottle and gets darker after a while.  </li>
            <li> Two of the most important are that your health will not be affected, if anything improved, and they last longer that other products that you need twice as much.</li>
            <li> I use this toner along with other sweetsation products and I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> I had some problems with my order in the past and the owner of the company went above and beyond to make sure I was satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I started using it about a month ago and still have a lot left, a lot goes a really long way which is nice to see.</li>
            <li> use C*Bella products only and this line is more economical than other organic products I bought from Wholefoods.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> Face Wash (lovely, simple and plentiful - will last for months on end)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> I had never used a toner until purchasing this and now, I will never be without this particular one.  </li>
            <li> I have only used it for two days now, morning and before bed, and have to say this leaves my skin feeling so clean and soft!</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t want to buy a toner with alcohol because I&#x27;ve heard it is bad for your skin, so when I read the ingredients I was very excited to see all the good and natural stuff in this product!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I have olive skin, my pigmentation is high.</li>
            <li> I need little bit more materialization&lt;</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and is super gentle.</li>
            <li> My skin felt soft &amp; hydrated,  and ready for Q*Lumière Organic Day crème with Cucumber.</li>
            <li> They are very patient and answered all my questions professionally.</li>
            <li> I am not all into ant-aging and the normal woman stuff</li>
            <li> (clinique 7 day daily scrub cleanser) and evening cleanses and my face always feels so fresh and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> It smelled nice and did not affect my skin negatively which is always a plus.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Afterwards I do my normal care</li>
            <li> I have better skin tone after using this for a month everyday.</li>
            <li> Her skin is easily irrupted and has lots of blemish, dark pore.</li>
            <li> (I also wish that I&#x27;d received some free samples of other Sweetsation Therapy products like some here have mentioned that they have received)</li>
            <li> Again, if you are looking for a new skincare regime, please give these products a try.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for about 2-3 weeks, but if the ingredients are any indicator, I should be seeing good results within a few months of daily cleansing.</li>
            <li> This toner helped to not only exfoliate and deep clean</li>
            <li> the toner works very well and does not dry out your skin.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is huge and will last for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I especially needed it for my nose area which has a lot of large pores.  </li>
            <li> Little bit light texture.  </li>
            <li> I had been looking for natural and preservative( paraben and phalates )</li>
            <li> I have to say for ordering this product so far for one week of use i can notice the difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have not had any problems using sweetsationtherapy.  </li>
            <li> It smells natural.</li>
            <li> My skin used to be so sensitive and adult acne prone.</li>
            <li> far I like it.</li>
            <li> actually seems to be really helping my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve decided that toners go very well with my facial routine</li>
            <li> Skin Brightener (Slow, safe and effective)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend</li>
            <li> My skin has never been so fresh and moisturized without the burning/stinging feeling I get from other products.</li>
            <li> I do understand that fine products come in small quantities, but-</li>
            <li> the fact that it is all natural is a major bonus in my book.  </li>
            <li> The cost is worth the freedom from skin irritation and unpredictable results from retail products on grocery or drug store shelves.</li>
            <li> way I use the toner is, I put the toner on 2 circle cotton and gently wipe your face all over through neck every single day and night.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I barely leave reviews for products</li>
            <li> i am big fan of natural organic products .</li>
            <li> I noticed the difference in my skin when I was going through my photos on my phone, where I really noticed that my skin brightened and my dark spots disappeared from old photos to recent ones.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty good skin, which I often receive compliments on, but I had a little bit of uneven skin tone with small dark spots on my forehead, and they have completely vanished.  </li>
            <li> As a male, it can be difficult to find an effective toner.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and sometimes toners will dry my skin out and/or irritate it.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I have always been hesitant to purchase skin products because it is so difficult to find products that actually do what they promise, not to mention that it is such a hassle to return them online.</li>
            <li> I apply the C*Bella after cleansing my face and neck with pure Black soap w/shea butter.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not harsh on the skin like other products I used before.</li>
            <li> No other extra irritants or blemishes appear due to its ease.</li>
            <li> The bottle also seems to be lasting a long time, you don&#x27;t need a lot for each use.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin and removes any extra make-up my cleanser didn&#x27;t get.  </li>
            <li> People often look at costs and run away, but if you really think about it, the toner and all the other products offered are not more expensive, they are cheaper in the long run for many reasons.</li>
            <li> These products are ones that I will stick with a really long time.</li>
            <li> Any skin care line is not complete without either a toner or astringent as part of the skin care regime.</li>
            <li> I like the packaging too as a little bit comes out with one pump which is enough for entire face and neck.</li>
            <li> ladies want and are expecting simple but careful packages !</li>
            <li> Because of the pricing and the size, I only use this toner every other day.</li>
            <li> I am a repeat customer and will continue buying this product for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> The toner will take away any dry skin areas to let your skin breath.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t turn my skin into a dry cracked desert.</li>
            <li> This statement may sound weird from a person who currently resides overseas, as there was little to no career growth for me there in my home of the USA; so I had to outsource my skills.  </li>
            <li> giving that I exercise often and have a very active outdoor life style (as I live in a climate that reflects 75-85 degree weather all year round).  </li>
            <li> After applying and letting it dry, my face looks and feels as if I already applied a moisturizer!</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is that if I use it everyday it tends to dry up my face.</li>
            <li> After using it for a few weeks I noticed my freckles seemed looking lighter, and overall skin tone seems to be brighter than before using the toner.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I did not see a difference from my witch hazel or other organic toners.</li>
            <li> But, the product is one which was returned by some other customer.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not right at all.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product hoping to lighten my dark spots that I have on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the products for at least 4 years and order it religiously even though I&#x27;m in Canada.</li>
            <li> These products have changed my skin in a week and a half.</li>
            <li> Any toner can do that for much less money.</li>
            <li> This toner made my freckles less noticeable and the pores that  once were enlarged are definately shirinking.</li>
            <li> i wont feel tight after using it.</li>
            <li> (I use it for my face and neck everyday) .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Waste of money, would not recommend!</li>
            <li> Thereby, the immediate results of life and glow I achieved from using a combination of sweesensations products over the past six months have been phenomenal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I utilize a small piece of cotton with about 3 to 4 medium-size drops and wipe it over my face and neck.</li>
            <li> My skin is so moisturized and no more blemishes...</li>
            <li> I am not sure if the quality of the toner is affected.</li>
            <li> I am very hard to please when it comes to skincare.  </li>
            <li> It does nothing but turn bad after few months of storage.  </li>
            <li> It was quite disappointing  </li>
            <li> My cotton pad looks dirty and I can&#x27;t even see if traces of makeup came off or not.</li>

            <li> very light smell &amp; i wont feel tight after using it. good to use with either day or night cream. feeling fresh &amp; smooth. love it!</li>
            <li> Waste of money, would not recommend!</li>
            <li> I just started using this product, and I love it.  I am very hard to please when it comes to skincare.  I think I have tried everything on the market, but the first time I used this product, I knew it was for me.  The toner feels great going on and is not over drying which is great since I started using it in December when the air is very dry.  I can feel the ingredients working right away, and it&#x27;s great to know that they are all organic and healthy.  The bottle is huge and will last for a very long time.  Again, if you are looking for a new skincare regime, please give these products a try.  You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> The toner is a refreshing addition to my face washing regimen. I am not all into ant-aging and the normal woman stuff but this product is really nice.I wish I had used it sooner. I started using it about a month ago and still have a lot left, a lot goes a really long way which is nice to see. The face foam I use first then apply this toner with a cotton ball or cotton pad and I can really see a difference, immedietly perks up my skin and brightens it. The toner will take away any dry skin areas to let your skin breath. Applying the toner is probably my favorite part of washing my face. It feels so nice to apply, if I could I was apply it all day.    These products are ones that I will stick with a really long time. The company does not push people to buy products that promise miricales. WHat is also nice is that the company does not promise miricales like most companies. Its really good to see that the products offered are for your health, naturally derived, with no gimmicks. What the company does promise is healthy products, and they are quite possibly the healthiest available. Research proves this and I am glad I stumbled along this company. I found what I need, and that is the same as what most woman need; a product that works and is healthy, a product that can be used for a very long time and not cause harm but give nice results. People often look at costs and run away, but if you really think about it, the toner and all the other products offered are not more expensive, they are cheaper in the long run for many reasons. Two of the most important are that your health will not be affected, if anything improved, and they last longer that other products that you need twice as much.</li>
            <li> This toner is very gentle, non-drying, lightly scented and well-absorbed.  A little goes a long way.  I use it daily as part of my skin care routine, along with the Lumi*Essence, I*light and moisturizer with sunscreen (which smells lightly and delightfully like chocolate).  The cost is worth the freedom from skin irritation and unpredictable results from retail products on grocery or drug store shelves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my irritated t-zone areas after my papaya face wash and it seems to help a lot!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this toner after washing my face.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin and removes any extra make-up my cleanser didn&#x27;t get.  I especially needed it for my nose area which has a lot of large pores.  My pores do look smaller since I started using it, so it&#x27;s working.  The bottle also seems to be lasting a long time, you don&#x27;t need a lot for each use.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for natural and preservative( paraben and phalates ) free skin care  products for a while and found Sweetsation and decided to try it.  I have combination skin and loved the \\&quot;C*Bella Organic Brightening Toner with Vitamin C and Enzymes\\&quot;. I kept my skin even toned without over drying it. My skin felt soft &amp; hydrated,  and ready for Q*Lumière Organic Day crème with Cucumber. I like the packaging too as a little bit comes out with one pump which is enough for entire face and neck. I highly recommend this product and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love that it is organic and it smells great.  I use it after my morning (clinique 7 day daily scrub cleanser) and evening cleanses and my face always feels so fresh and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> I have to say for ordering this product so far for one week of use i can notice the difference in my skin. I recommend this product to anyone that is thinking of buying it or will buy it in the future. I have used so many products in my life and this product if by far the best ther is out in the world of do it your self at home, hahaha. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with their products! This is the only skin care products that i would recommend to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;I am really happy with my purchase and going to try more of their other products too. Oh yes,I have to agree that their customer Service is beyond Excellent! They are very patient and answered all my questions professionally.</li>
            <li> I  use the C*Bella Organic Brightening Toner on my face as I find it helps tighten my pores and I can sometimes feel it working. Any skin care line is not complete without either a toner or astringent as part of the skin care regime. It is a critical step that is often over looked. This step closes the pores, adjusts the pH of the skin and removes any remaining cleanser or dirt from the skin. The Vitamin C helps fight free radicals and sun damage. I can tell when I skip this step because the rest of my regime does not go on as smoothly as it should.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews generally speaking, but I couldn&#x27;t resist due to the joy these products have brought to my life and the fact that all the company activities are founded and based in United States of America.  I turned 37 this year and my face was beginning to lose its glow...It was quite disappointing  giving that I exercise often and have a very active outdoor life style (as I live in a climate that reflects 75-85 degree weather all year round).  Not to mention, I only eat organic fruits and vegetables (no animals)... Thereby, the immediate results of life and glow I achieved from using a combination of sweesensations products over the past six months have been phenomenal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most important factors about these products are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  All Natural&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Made, tested, Manufactured, Owned and Represented in the United States of America (Extremely, important when many jobs are going overseas.  This statement may sound weird from a person who currently resides overseas, as there was little to no career growth for me there in my home of the USA; so I had to outsource my skills.  Thereby, any chance I have to purchase and support American made products, I will)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Customer Service is beyond Excellent (I don&#x27;t like spending money where its not valued)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Shipping overseas is not a drama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favourite Products:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Very Berry face Scrub (Such an overwhelming joy to use)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Toner (the best toner ever used, clearly minimises pores)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Face Wash (lovely, simple and plentiful - will last for months on end)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Skin Brightener (Slow, safe and effective)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend</li>
            <li> I utilize a small piece of cotton with about 3 to 4 medium-size drops and wipe it over my face and neck. The substance is not sticky or drying. Without any burning sensation or a cooling effect (which can constrict pores). The toner helps absorb any moisutrizer and allows it to settle in to the pores at a slower-pace, which in turn relieves any clogging that may occur with heavier creams. I recommend this toner 100% over the many others I have tried simply because this one is effective on doing what a toner is suppose to do. No other extra irritants or blemishes appear due to its ease. Try it, you will be hooked like me.</li>
            <li> When my MOM notices a difference in my skin, i KNOW this product must be working! I use this with the Lumi*Essence Organic Advanced Skin Brightening / Whitening Repair Treatment</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice and difference or improvement with this product.</li>
            <li> From the very first time I applied this product to my face I felt and saw results....my skin felt clean, refreshed, and even hydrated.  Best of all, I am reassured that this toner is good for me and my skin with its all natural ingredients and organic qualities, none of the harsh chemicals that get absorbed into my bloodstream.  I originally purchased this when I found out I was pregnant, but I plan to continue using this line even after the bambino arrives....so luxuriously healthy!</li>
            <li> For a year I was looking for good natural toners for my teenager. Her skin is easily irrupted and has lots of blemish, dark pore. I ordered lots of products for her, but it didn&#x27;t work very well untill meeting C*Bella Organic Toner. It makes my girl&#x27;s face more brighter and clearer. We really like this product. I recommended moms who have teenagers like me. I used it too.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome tonic for someone like me who is looking for products that are environmental friendly and gentle and pure for the skin.  This product does not cause me to break out.</li>
            <li> I love this toner. The smell is beautiful and I love the way it feels when I put it on my face. I ordered this toner because I love so many products in this line, I just felt like this would be a great product too. I was not disappointed. I have sensitive skin and have not had any problems using sweetsationtherapy.  What a great \\&quot;pick-me-up\\&quot; for your skin.  These products have changed my skin in a week and a half. It&#x27;s extremely cool to even be able to  make a statement like that. Truly enjoying taking care of my skin.</li>
            <li> YUMMY LOVE THE SMELL LOVE THE WAY IT FEELS ON MY SKIN PLUS I LIKE THE WAY IT MOISTURIZES MY SKIN IT FEELS SMOOTH AND IT SMELLS GOOD, COULD ASK FOR A BETTER TONER</li>
            <li> This toner is very effective and does a great job removing any dirt or makeup that my cleanser wasn&#x27;t able to take off. The best part is I use it every night and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and is super gentle.</li>
            <li> I really like this toner! I purchased this product hoping to lighten my dark spots that I have on my cheeks. After using it for a few weeks I noticed my freckles seemed looking lighter, and overall skin tone seems to be brighter than before using the toner. The texture is very light, which is great for summer, but I think a little bit too light in colder seasons.</li>
            <li> I have never used a toner before and when I started using the Sweetsation Therapy products and I saw all the amazing reviews about the toner I thought I would give it a try. And now I am hooked. Every morning and every morning before I apply my Sweetsation lotion I use the toner and it makes my skin feels so clean and soft. It has also improved the texture of my skin, my skin is brighter and my sun spots are going away. I highly recommend all the Sweetsation products to every woman who is looking for great skin products without all the chemicals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the C*Bella Organic Brightening Toner with Vitamin C and Enzymes two times a day along with the LaNouvel Cellular Hyaluronic acid Nutri Serum with Collagen / Elastin, Peptides, Dragon&#x27;s Blood &amp; Resveratrol and the Q&#x27;Lumiere Organic Day creme with Cucumber &amp; CoQ10 in the morning &amp; Aqua*Tica Organic Botanical Night Cream in the evening before bed.  The results are amazing.  My skin is so moisturized and no more blemishes...ever! I love it!!</li>
            <li> All the sweet sensation products are awesome. Could see the change in a weeks time. My skin was was glowing after I started using it.</li>
            <li> As a male, it can be difficult to find an effective toner. Thank goodness I found C*Bella. It shrank my pores, and brightened my complexion leaving me with a very youthful glow. I will definitely be ordering this product again. To make matters better, the toner is organic. It doesn&#x27;t get any better than that.</li>
            <li> I used the bottle up which lasted 2 months with twice daily use. I did not see a difference from my witch hazel or other organic toners. It smelled nice and did not affect my skin negatively which is always a plus.</li>
            <li> I like this toner, it cleans my pores and even diminishes wrinkles. The only problem I have is that if I use it everyday it tends to dry up my face. I do have dry skin, so it probably won&#x27;t be any problem for most people.</li>
            <li> It does nothing but turn bad after few months of storage.  Witch hazel for a buck does a way better job than wasting money on these products.</li>
            <li> I like this alcohol free organic product. It smells natural. This is the only toner I&#x27;m using now.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have sun spots or age spots. I like it so much because it works so well on brightening my face and reducing enlarged pores. It&#x27;s good to use this toner before I apply the day cream on face. My face is getting supple and smooth without large pores. And my face looks clean and glowing because the toner lighten blemishes and brighten my whole face and neck (I use it for my face and neck everyday) .&lt;br /&gt;I like the sweetsation line products and will buy more of them.</li>
            <li> I am a faithful customer of sweetsations therapy. I absolutely love their products. My skin has never been so fresh and moisturized without the burning/stinging feeling I get from other products. My skin used to be so sensitive and adult acne prone. I&#x27;ve been using the products for at least 4 years and order it religiously even though I&#x27;m in Canada. I can&#x27;t thank you enough for your beautiful line and the lifetime of irritation and eczema that they soothe and take away, even throughout my pregnancy. The sunscreen was a lifesaver for myself and my son. The smells are amazing. Make a purchase and you won&#x27;t regret it! Their customer service is also top notch. I recently reordered the serum, like I said before, their company if spectacular!!!!</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and get break-out so easily from what I use.&lt;br /&gt;This is gentle but keeps my skin soft and clear.&lt;br /&gt;Even my aesthetician I see once a month says I have good regime to take care of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I use C*Bella products only and this line is more economical than other organic products I bought from Wholefoods.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t see your skin improve drastically but over the time, you can see the difference.</li>
            <li> I see no difference whatsoever from this product other than it works ok for making sure all my makeup came off and my skin is ok to apply my next steps. Any toner can do that for much less money. Granted the ingredients are gentler and more preferable in this product. I don&#x27;t like the looks of it though. It looks like it&#x27;s gone &#x27;bad&#x27; like oxidized fruit or something. My cotton pad looks dirty and I can&#x27;t even see if traces of makeup came off or not. Maybe this won&#x27;t bother you, but it didn&#x27;t appeal to me.</li>
            <li> Love this.  Feels great, skin looks great.</li>
            <li> I really love this toner which makes my face evenly toned and it&#x27;s not harsh on the skin like other products I used before. I would recommend this toner a 5 star.</li>
            <li> I have been using the &amp;#34;C&#x27;Bella Toner &amp;#34; almost a year.&lt;br /&gt;The way I use the toner is, I put the toner on 2 circle cotton and gently wipe your face all over through neck every single day and night.&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards I do my normal care but since I start gently wiping over my skin with the toner, my FACE SKIN is BRIGHTER, CLEANER, CLEARER, FREE from ACNE,!&lt;br /&gt;I also feel my NECK is SMOOTH.&lt;br /&gt;The wrapping for the merchandise are simple but hand by care.&lt;br /&gt;Especially when it comes to cosmetics or beauty kits, we ! ladies want and are expecting simple but careful packages !</li>
            <li> This is yet another Sweetsation Therapy product I am very pleased with...the toner works very well and does not dry out your skin.  Smells great too!  I will be using this toner from now on!</li>
            <li> Just bought this product about 2 weeks ago and have been using it with the berry masque and LaNouvel Cellular Hyaluronic acid....&lt;br /&gt;So far I like it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product, c*Bella Brightening Toner, on Monday. On Wednesday, which is today, it&#x27;s delivered to me. That&#x27;s fast; I did not expect it. But, the product is one which was returned by some other customer. It is 3/4 full and opened. I am very disappointed. Argania or sweetsation, I am not going to use your return product for you. That&#x27;s not right at all.</li>
            <li> So I read several articles that stated that Vitamin C was healthy for your skin and was looking for an introduction product to start me on my path. This item seemed to have lots of positive reviews and was in my price range, so I decided to give it a shot. When I received my item, I also received a couple free samples of their other items, which I thought was nice. I began noticing my skin looking and feeling better, almost immediately after I began using their products. I also have very acne prone skin and these products don&#x27;t cause me to break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a huge fan and am so pleased I found this skin care line!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice anything special but it&#x27;s a nice toner</li>
            <li> I have been buying this toner for the last 2 years or so and love it!  It has become a staple in my beauty routine.  I have very sensitive skin and sometimes toners will dry my skin out and/or irritate it.  This is the first one that doesn&#x27;t.  My skin is left feeling refreshed, moisturized and not irritated.  I highly recommend.  I am a repeat customer and will continue buying this product for a very long time.  If you are on the fence, definitely give it a try, it is worth it :)</li>
            <li> I decided recently that I need to change and add somethings to my skin care regimen and so I bought this toner. I have only used it for two days now, morning and before bed, and have to say this leaves my skin feeling so clean and soft! I used to only use a face wash and face lotion and now decided to add a toner and serum, and am so glad I picked this toner because I am very prone to acne and have pretty oily skin. My skin is super sensitive to break outs, and I am just so happy this has not made me break out and actually seems to be really helping my skin. Love this product so far and hope it keep doing wonders to my skin like I believe it will after what I&#x27;ve experienced in the past 2 days alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really really love this product because it is organic. I really didn&#x27;t want to buy a toner with alcohol because I&#x27;ve heard it is bad for your skin, so when I read the ingredients I was very excited to see all the good and natural stuff in this product! I barely leave reviews for products I purchase but I was just so happy with how this product made my skin feel after using it that I felt as if I needed to tell everyone!</li>
            <li> I use this toner along with other sweetsation products and I LOVE it.  I&#x27;ve decided that toners go very well with my facial routine and I feel like it is making a difference in my skin.  You can&#x27;t beat the ingredients that is in it and the fact that it is all natural is a major bonus in my book.  I am confident that I will continue using this product for a LONG time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that sweetsation customer service is amazing.  I had some problems with my order in the past and the owner of the company went above and beyond to make sure I was satisfied.  It truly changed my opinion of what I thought the customer service was and I am very appreciative that some companies still know that customer satisfaction is how your company stays successful!!</li>
            <li> I like it.  I think skin turns to bright.  I need little bit more materialization&lt;br /&gt;with it.  Little bit light texture.  I like there policy of eco-recycle bottle also&lt;br /&gt;natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t see much of a difference or improvement with my skin from using this product. i know all products react differently to different skins so take it with a grain of salt.</li>
            <li> This toner helped to not only exfoliate and deep clean but it didn&#x27;t turn my skin into a dry cracked desert. The smell is wonderfully refreshing and cooling.</li>
            <li> I am really happy I gave this toner a try. I have olive skin, my pigmentation is high. This toner made my freckles less noticeable and the pores that  once were enlarged are definately shirinking. I love it!. I&#x27;m on my second bottle.</li>
            <li> i been using this product for a while now . i am big fan of natural organic products . When i tried this toner my skin felt fresh , clean . My skin is glowing now , my pores are smaller , i feel 10 years younger</li>
            <li> This is really working. I have better skin tone after using this for a month everyday. I&#x27;m still using it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I had been under some extra stress and, of course, breakouts follow leaving mark &#x3D;(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a three (3) weeks since I started using this product.  One does NOT notice remarkable results right away.  But now I do see them.  Just like anything that is organic, it takes time to have an effect on/in your body, so be patient if you want to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I see my face much clearer now.  I use it twice daily, am &amp; pm.&lt;br /&gt;* I have oily skin and not over drying has occurred nor any side effects or allergic reactions&lt;br /&gt;* While I use a variety of facial cleansers and acne creams (all organic) I believe this tonic has helped greatly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend it and I will purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. Judging from the level content in the bottle, I can &#x27;guesstimate&#x27; it to last me two (2) more months, perhaps even more.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I have always been hesitant to purchase skin products because it is so difficult to find products that actually do what they promise, not to mention that it is such a hassle to return them online. However, after thoroughly reviewing all the reviews on sweetsation products, I have decided to give it a go, and I am so glad I did. I noticed the difference in my skin when I was going through my photos on my phone, where I really noticed that my skin brightened and my dark spots disappeared from old photos to recent ones. I have a pretty good skin, which I often receive compliments on, but I had a little bit of uneven skin tone with small dark spots on my forehead, and they have completely vanished.  I will be ordering my third bottle as I am very satisfied with this toner.</li>
            <li> So far so good, a great product.&lt;br /&gt;Good to use during pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommended it to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for about 2-3 weeks, but if the ingredients are any indicator, I should be seeing good results within a few months of daily cleansing.</li>
            <li> This toner is awesome - my skin looks healthier and younger since I&#x27;ve been using the Sweetsation products and the toner is a huge part of that equation.  Used to think toner was an optional step in cleansing but no longer do since using this one.</li>
            <li> The C*Bella Organic Brightening Toner with Vitamin C and Enzymes, 6 oz, arrived about 3 or 4 days sooner than the estimated arrival time and I am very pleased with this. The packaging was excellent. The toner itself is delightful. I use Dickinson&#x27;s Pore Perfecting Toner twice a day on my face and neck. That is my go to facial toner. The C*Bella will be my second facial toner that I rely on for beauty purposes. I apply the C*Bella after cleansing my face and neck with pure Black soap w/shea butter. My skin becomes so supple and I immediately feel my face tighten in a wonderful way. After applying and letting it dry, my face looks and feels as if I already applied a moisturizer! It smells like delicious berries and I recommend this facial toner for anyone&#x27;s beauty purposes. This is a 5 star product. If I could change anything about this product It would be the size. How about an 8 or 10 oz bottle? I do understand that fine products come in small quantities, but- that is my wish. (I also wish that I&#x27;d received some free samples of other Sweetsation Therapy products like some here have mentioned that they have received) Because of the pricing and the size, I only use this toner every other day. I use the Dickinson&#x27;s every day. I am so looking forward to trying more Sweetsation Therapy organic products. *I am LC from NC*</li>
            <li> This is the only Sweetsation product that I didn&#x27;t give a four stars.  It&#x27;s because for somereason the color of the toner changes overtime.  It is light colored when you just open the bottle and gets darker after a while.  I am not sure if the quality of the toner is affected.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love C*Bella Brightening Toner!!  It immediately makes my face feel so clean, smooth and soft.  I can tell such a difference in my skin when I forget to apply it.  I had never used a toner until purchasing this and now, I will never be without this particular one.  I am so happy that I came across the reviews of Sweetsation&#x27;s products on Amazon!  I am now in love with this line of skincare!!  I like that the products are made with great, all-natural ingredients and the fact that they actually work.</li>
