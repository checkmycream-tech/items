            <li>Okay.. bought this product after hearing that it helps hair grow.  </li>

            <li>It is stronger and more lusterous.  </li>
            <li>and I was told to leave on my hair for an hour or more..</li>
            <li>love this oil</li>
            <li>the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me because I love exotic spicy smells, but I can understand why some can&#x27;t get used to it.</li>
            <li>Be sure to protect anything you rest your hair on.</li>
            <li>I love castor oil.</li>
            <li>WOMEN&#x27;S LONG HEALTHY AND BEAUTIFUL HAIR!!!</li>
            <li>and I am so excited!</li>
            <li>My hair is so strong and healthy.</li>
            <li>&quot; LOL, I couldn&#x27;t believe my ears from all the wow&#x27;s that my family and friends were saying.</li>
            <li>while there are a lot of good things in this product, and i really wanted to try it</li>
            <li>I can easily comb my hair without worries of clumps of hair loss.</li>
            <li>ALso what i like about this product is that it does not leave the hair greasy for the product absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li>(Reminds me of the scent of strong maple syrub marriaged with fragrant overtones.)</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair nurished and strong.</li>
            <li>The smell is so strong that I couldn&#x27;t sleep.  </li>
            <li>Will try to use them up as time permits to free under sink area.</li>
            <li>I purchased the product primarily for use on my 10-year-old daughter&#x27;s hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li>It nourrishes your hair and let them smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>but it will be light wieght</li>
            <li>and you can have light curls</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it was cheap enough for me to be able to just throw out without shedding too many tears.  </li>
            <li>Significant Hair  growth since using this product.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been searching for all natural products, and making my own as well.</li>
            <li>Her hair is amazingly soft and feels strong and healthy.  </li>
            <li>Next, I rinsed it all out with warm water, then, I used the Shakakai shampoo/conditioner twice to a third time to give it a good clean.</li>
            <li>It was not unpleasant, however, it lingered a bit.</li>
            <li>it makes my hair smooth and soft!!!!</li>
            <li>I originally made a review for this product when I first bought this product</li>
            <li>I used the Shakakai oil all over my entire scalp doing a circular massaging motion on my entire scalp with the oil, This stuff smells like some strong seasoning spices and curry lol,</li>
            <li>SINCE THE AGE OF 9 YEARS OLD HAS FOUND ITS MIRICLE FOR GROWTH NOW!!!!!</li>
            <li>I always drift right back to Hesh because I reap the fruits of my labor with strong healthy looking hair that doesn&#x27;t shed when I rinse the product out like</li>
            <li>I have only used this product for a month and the results are amazing..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this oil since 11/07/14 on weekdays only and it seems to be working nicely.</li>
            <li>I really love this oil because it makes my hair soft and shiny, it has a distinct odor</li>
            <li>I still wanna be as natural still but be able to manage it.</li>
            <li>before rinsing the Shakakai oil out, I took two table spoons of the Sulfur Sublimed Powder and mixed it with a cup of warm water, I stired it up for a while until the powder was all dissolved.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give the oil a chance but best believe I am back on my grind oiling my hair every other night and doing my powder mixes once a week.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants long beautiful hair!</li>
            <li>my hair is so much stronger and full.</li>
            <li>but it does stink very very much.</li>
            <li>The texture is light and the scent is both masculine and feminine.</li>
            <li>I definitely have more hair growth...</li>
            <li>I have seen some growth...but will write a better review at a much later time.  </li>
            <li>I use this in addition to the paste every couple of days, and my hair is really thanking me for it!</li>
            <li>Ok, I&#x27;ve ordered it recently and started using it as soon it arrived.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hello, I&#x27;m back! :)</li>
            <li>I used the oil consistently for a month.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;ll pay more attention.</li>
            <li>but first I decided to try to leave it on during the day when I am at home.</li>
            <li>I read up on a few articles that the oils in this product is great for those who have gone natural from hair relaxing.</li>
            <li>The smell of this oil was strong at first but all of a sudden</li>
            <li>it keeps my hair lovely long, well nourished and manageable.</li>
            <li>HOW DO THE INDIAN WOMEN GET THIER HAIR TO BE SOOOO LONG AND HEALTHY???</li>
            <li>I love long hair and love to care for long hair.</li>
            <li>The scent is strong and lasting, but the benefits from the oil exceed the smell in my opinion.</li>
            <li>WOW could this stuff really be working?!!</li>
            <li>And it does promote fast hair growth.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve really laid off the oil except for henna mixes.  </li>
            <li>The oil isn&#x27;t greasy on the hair but the fragrance is very pungent.</li>
            <li>if applied to much.</li>
            <li>So it is much to soon to say if this product works and promotes hair growth.</li>
            <li>Even if I trim my ends, my hair continues to grow so much.</li>
            <li>and it looks soo much longer.</li>
            <li>This Herbal Hair Oil made my hair very manageable.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product in September 2009 after doing intense research on Ayurvedic type hair products.</li>
            <li>its shiny and grows fast.</li>
            <li>The powders are quite messy but effective.</li>
            <li>I make a paste every 4 days with the powders mixed in with my conditioners and I am so excited at how my hair is progressing.     </li>
            <li>The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me since I&#x27;m already familiar with similar smells because of my Caribbean background.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who wants their hair to be longer and</li>
            <li>This product works fine for your hair if they are dry, however it says to put it on and leave it on overnight...</li>
            <li>The smell of this product is way to strong and can be very over powering, which is a major set back.  </li>
            <li>This product is decent.</li>
            <li>I mainly used it on my frizz, and split ends &amp; it helps.</li>
            <li>It really does condition the hair from root to tip leaving it very soft</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them both.</li>
            <li>Very misleading if you think you&#x27;re getting All Natural Ingredients.</li>
            <li>The one thing that I wanted was for my hair to be HEALTHY not necessary long anymore.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not negatively affecting my hair at all.</li>
            <li>, I am actually wearing it right now.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s also doing wonders for new growth as well.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft it feels like silk !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found so far!</li>
            <li>Usually I am not a fan of mineral oil being in my hair products</li>
            <li>, I did know that heat can damage your hair, infact, I put NO heat on my hair at all for yeeeeaars, i always kept my scalp and ends greased, ive done hot oil treatments every 6 months, I only used no-lye olive oil perms once a year becuase</li>
            <li>I want to use it for hot oil treatments, since it went so  well for pre pooing and my deep conditioning treatments.</li>
            <li>has an unusual smell but is not smelly its like an organic type of oil and is light and i apply to scalp and its sleek and will work as a hair strand seperater i apply and flat iron it leaves hair shiny and lays the hair not really a thickener</li>
            <li>and so I went and grabbed my laptop and set down and googled it (for real!!!).</li>
            <li>If you use a hot comb or flat iron, the oil protects the hair well from heat damage.    </li>
            <li>whenever I use this my hair turns to a rich black.  </li>
            <li>After using this oil in my hair twice..it has given life back to my hair, now it&#x27;s very manageable again &amp; soft.</li>
            <li>i have naturally texturized hair</li>
            <li>so far I think this stuff works like it should.</li>
            <li>and so it breaks frequently.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and shiny</li>
            <li>Oh and another thing, while using this oil my hair had COMPLETELY stopped shedding...COMPLETELY.</li>
            <li>I can tell it&#x27;s getting soft again already.</li>
            <li>I use it as my prepoo and it lets my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>I am 26years old now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a blatino with.combi hair; the Africans,puerto ricans,and Cubans we&#x27;re just wild.</li>
            <li>When my hair was natural I used it after shampooing to twist or braid out.</li>
            <li>Made my hair extremely soft.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>It made my hair really soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t speak to the efficacy of the product, because i didn&#x27;t try it, but if you&#x27;re looking for an all natural, plant-based product, this is not it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been natural for over two years and my hair is pretty long</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know why some people hate the smell so much, I love it.</li>
            <li>Can be used as a hot oil treatment and works well if you use it to blow dry.</li>
            <li>When I first tried the oil it was overwhelming because I was a little heavy handed with my application.</li>
            <li>Iam natural African American hairWorks very well grows hair and nice on dry hands and feet add a few drops to lotion for skin</li>
            <li>saying, \\&quot;WOW your hair was just at you shoulders three weeks ago and now its down to your upper back, how do you keep it so healthy, what type of products are you using on</li>
            <li>only negative thing I must say is that the smell is very strong</li>
            <li>One thing I like about the oil is that it makes my hair soft and easy to manage in the morning and even at two weeks I am starting to notice less hair breakage, which is a major plus.</li>
            <li>My hair was right above shoulder length when I started using the product, and now it is past my shoulders full and thick, and I&#x27;m constantly getting compliments on how healthy my hair looks.    </li>
            <li>a major growth spurt that&#x27;s still going!  </li>
            <li>The next morning I shampoo it out and condition my hair like normal.</li>
            <li>The shipping cost is very high, but the bottle lasts very long.</li>
            <li>I was natural for about three years until I had my hair permed last month.  </li>
            <li>Be careful not to use too much product, it will make hair greasy.</li>
            <li>And not only is it growing but it is growing HEALTHY&amp; LONG but also THICK AND RAPIDLY.</li>
            <li>I am an African American women who one day cut off all my relaxed ends and decided to become natural.</li>
            <li>I cannot wait for the results, it is definitely all natural and I will definitely recommend this oil to friends and family.</li>
            <li>Next I put that mixture all on my scalp massaging it in that same circular soft motion on my scalp.</li>
            <li>im an african american with natural hair..</li>
            <li>I a few drops in hot oil treatments, just to use because I paid for it.</li>
            <li>it leaves my hair really dry, and every time i use it my hair gets weak and it is breaking a lot more than before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 100% black and this thing is REALLY making my hair grow..</li>
            <li>The scent is quite strong and unpleasant at first..</li>
    </ol>

            <li> the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me because I love exotic spicy smells, but I can understand why some can&#x27;t get used to it.</li>

            <li> My hair is so strong and healthy.</li>
            <li> &quot; LOL, I couldn&#x27;t believe my ears from all the wow&#x27;s that my family and friends were saying.</li>
            <li> while there are a lot of good things in this product, and i really wanted to try it</li>
            <li> I can easily comb my hair without worries of clumps of hair loss.</li>
            <li> ALso what i like about this product is that it does not leave the hair greasy for the product absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li> (Reminds me of the scent of strong maple syrub marriaged with fragrant overtones.)</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair nurished and strong.</li>
            <li> The smell is so strong that I couldn&#x27;t sleep.  </li>
            <li> Will try to use them up as time permits to free under sink area.</li>
            <li> I purchased the product primarily for use on my 10-year-old daughter&#x27;s hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li> It nourrishes your hair and let them smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li> but it will be light wieght</li>
            <li> and you can have light curls</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it was cheap enough for me to be able to just throw out without shedding too many tears.  </li>
            <li> Significant Hair  growth since using this product.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been searching for all natural products, and making my own as well.</li>
            <li> Her hair is amazingly soft and feels strong and healthy.  </li>
            <li> Next, I rinsed it all out with warm water, then, I used the Shakakai shampoo/conditioner twice to a third time to give it a good clean.</li>
            <li> It was not unpleasant, however, it lingered a bit.</li>
            <li> it makes my hair smooth and soft!!!!</li>
            <li> I originally made a review for this product when I first bought this product</li>
            <li> I used the Shakakai oil all over my entire scalp doing a circular massaging motion on my entire scalp with the oil, This stuff smells like some strong seasoning spices and curry lol,</li>
            <li> SINCE THE AGE OF 9 YEARS OLD HAS FOUND ITS MIRICLE FOR GROWTH NOW!!!!!</li>
            <li> I always drift right back to Hesh because I reap the fruits of my labor with strong healthy looking hair that doesn&#x27;t shed when I rinse the product out like</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for a month and the results are amazing..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil since 11/07/14 on weekdays only and it seems to be working nicely.</li>
            <li> I really love this oil because it makes my hair soft and shiny, it has a distinct odor</li>
            <li> I still wanna be as natural still but be able to manage it.</li>
            <li> before rinsing the Shakakai oil out, I took two table spoons of the Sulfur Sublimed Powder and mixed it with a cup of warm water, I stired it up for a while until the powder was all dissolved.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give the oil a chance but best believe I am back on my grind oiling my hair every other night and doing my powder mixes once a week.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants long beautiful hair!</li>
            <li> my hair is so much stronger and full.</li>
            <li> but it does stink very very much.</li>
            <li> The texture is light and the scent is both masculine and feminine.</li>
            <li> I definitely have more hair growth...</li>
            <li> I have seen some growth...but will write a better review at a much later time.  </li>
            <li> I use this in addition to the paste every couple of days, and my hair is really thanking me for it!</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;ve ordered it recently and started using it as soon it arrived.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hello, I&#x27;m back! :)</li>
            <li> I used the oil consistently for a month.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;ll pay more attention.</li>
            <li> but first I decided to try to leave it on during the day when I am at home.</li>
            <li> I read up on a few articles that the oils in this product is great for those who have gone natural from hair relaxing.</li>
            <li> The smell of this oil was strong at first but all of a sudden</li>
            <li> it keeps my hair lovely long, well nourished and manageable.</li>
            <li> HOW DO THE INDIAN WOMEN GET THIER HAIR TO BE SOOOO LONG AND HEALTHY???</li>
            <li> I love long hair and love to care for long hair.</li>
            <li> The scent is strong and lasting, but the benefits from the oil exceed the smell in my opinion.</li>
            <li> WOW could this stuff really be working?!!</li>
            <li> And it does promote fast hair growth.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve really laid off the oil except for henna mixes.  </li>
            <li> The oil isn&#x27;t greasy on the hair but the fragrance is very pungent.</li>
            <li> if applied to much.</li>
            <li> So it is much to soon to say if this product works and promotes hair growth.</li>
            <li> Even if I trim my ends, my hair continues to grow so much.</li>
            <li> and it looks soo much longer.</li>
            <li> This Herbal Hair Oil made my hair very manageable.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product in September 2009 after doing intense research on Ayurvedic type hair products.</li>
            <li> its shiny and grows fast.</li>
            <li> The powders are quite messy but effective.</li>
            <li> I make a paste every 4 days with the powders mixed in with my conditioners and I am so excited at how my hair is progressing.     </li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me since I&#x27;m already familiar with similar smells because of my Caribbean background.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who wants their hair to be longer and</li>
            <li> This product works fine for your hair if they are dry, however it says to put it on and leave it on overnight...</li>
            <li> The smell of this product is way to strong and can be very over powering, which is a major set back.  </li>
            <li> This product is decent.</li>
            <li> I mainly used it on my frizz, and split ends &amp; it helps.</li>
            <li> It really does condition the hair from root to tip leaving it very soft</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them both.</li>
            <li> Very misleading if you think you&#x27;re getting All Natural Ingredients.</li>
            <li> The one thing that I wanted was for my hair to be HEALTHY not necessary long anymore.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not negatively affecting my hair at all.</li>
            <li> , I am actually wearing it right now.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s also doing wonders for new growth as well.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft it feels like silk !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found so far!</li>
            <li> Usually I am not a fan of mineral oil being in my hair products</li>
            <li> , I did know that heat can damage your hair, infact, I put NO heat on my hair at all for yeeeeaars, i always kept my scalp and ends greased, ive done hot oil treatments every 6 months, I only used no-lye olive oil perms once a year becuase</li>
            <li> I want to use it for hot oil treatments, since it went so  well for pre pooing and my deep conditioning treatments.</li>
            <li> has an unusual smell but is not smelly its like an organic type of oil and is light and i apply to scalp and its sleek and will work as a hair strand seperater i apply and flat iron it leaves hair shiny and lays the hair not really a thickener</li>
            <li> and so I went and grabbed my laptop and set down and googled it (for real!!!).</li>
            <li> If you use a hot comb or flat iron, the oil protects the hair well from heat damage.    </li>
            <li> whenever I use this my hair turns to a rich black.  </li>
            <li> After using this oil in my hair twice..it has given life back to my hair, now it&#x27;s very manageable again &amp; soft.</li>
            <li> i have naturally texturized hair</li>
            <li> so far I think this stuff works like it should.</li>
            <li> and so it breaks frequently.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and shiny</li>
            <li> Oh and another thing, while using this oil my hair had COMPLETELY stopped shedding...COMPLETELY.</li>
            <li> I can tell it&#x27;s getting soft again already.</li>
            <li> I use it as my prepoo and it lets my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> I am 26years old now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a blatino with.combi hair; the Africans,puerto ricans,and Cubans we&#x27;re just wild.</li>
            <li> When my hair was natural I used it after shampooing to twist or braid out.</li>
            <li> Made my hair extremely soft.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> It made my hair really soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t speak to the efficacy of the product, because i didn&#x27;t try it, but if you&#x27;re looking for an all natural, plant-based product, this is not it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been natural for over two years and my hair is pretty long</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know why some people hate the smell so much, I love it.</li>
            <li> Can be used as a hot oil treatment and works well if you use it to blow dry.</li>
            <li> When I first tried the oil it was overwhelming because I was a little heavy handed with my application.</li>
            <li> Iam natural African American hairWorks very well grows hair and nice on dry hands and feet add a few drops to lotion for skin</li>
            <li> saying, \\&quot;WOW your hair was just at you shoulders three weeks ago and now its down to your upper back, how do you keep it so healthy, what type of products are you using on</li>
            <li> only negative thing I must say is that the smell is very strong</li>
            <li> One thing I like about the oil is that it makes my hair soft and easy to manage in the morning and even at two weeks I am starting to notice less hair breakage, which is a major plus.</li>
            <li> My hair was right above shoulder length when I started using the product, and now it is past my shoulders full and thick, and I&#x27;m constantly getting compliments on how healthy my hair looks.    </li>
            <li> a major growth spurt that&#x27;s still going!  </li>
            <li> The next morning I shampoo it out and condition my hair like normal.</li>
            <li> The shipping cost is very high, but the bottle lasts very long.</li>
            <li> I was natural for about three years until I had my hair permed last month.  </li>
            <li> Be careful not to use too much product, it will make hair greasy.</li>
            <li> And not only is it growing but it is growing HEALTHY&amp; LONG but also THICK AND RAPIDLY.</li>
            <li> I am an African American women who one day cut off all my relaxed ends and decided to become natural.</li>
            <li> I cannot wait for the results, it is definitely all natural and I will definitely recommend this oil to friends and family.</li>
            <li> Next I put that mixture all on my scalp massaging it in that same circular soft motion on my scalp.</li>
            <li> im an african american with natural hair..</li>
            <li> I a few drops in hot oil treatments, just to use because I paid for it.</li>
            <li> it leaves my hair really dry, and every time i use it my hair gets weak and it is breaking a lot more than before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 100% black and this thing is REALLY making my hair grow..</li>
            <li> The scent is quite strong and unpleasant at first..</li>
            <li> A little really goes a long way.</li>
            <li> just recently washed my hair and flat ironed it</li>
            <li> Comes to find out that humans hair all have some sort of resting stage in life meaning that our hair comes to a point of stop growing past a certain length no matter if your doing all those things to it to keep health and growing.     </li>
            <li> This oil has definitely helped my damaged hair recover (I have Caucasian hair, which is wavy and 24 inches long).</li>
            <li> This product has a really herbally and a bit soapy smell to it, but it can be toned down if you mix it with other oils you like.</li>
            <li> do a single braid and sleep in a shower cap...then wash it out the next morning.  </li>
            <li> My friend has recommended for years that I use Amla oil but totally forgotten about it until recently when I&#x27;ve been experiencing extreme hair loss &amp; dryness.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not heavy and a little goes along way .</li>
            <li> My hair used to shed a lot especially when wet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now 05/20/2011 and for some strange reason everyone of my friends and family have started playing with my hair running thier hands and fingers through it</li>
            <li> She had an extremely dry scalp with flakes of dead/dry skin.    </li>
            <li> however it started to become dry &amp; unmanageable.</li>
            <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t stick with them long enough because of the smell, mess and time consumption with these products.</li>
            <li> Then I do a a big single indian braid and tie it down with a silk wrap.  </li>
            <li> the main ingredient is vegetable oil, number two is mineral oil, which i don&#x27;t want on my body at all, then a few good things, then a few more bad things, and a few bad dyes and things.</li>
            <li> I was using this from mid July to now (past mid Sept).</li>
            <li> I have very dry brittle hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always said it was that in between type of hair that&#x27;s a curly mess if not managed properly.</li>
            <li> I was a little skepticle and decided about 1 week later and went on Amazon.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> They are kinda messy, I brought all of the different kinds in oil and powder.</li>
            <li> It smells like curry but doesn&#x27;t last after a few hours.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful about amount you put on because hair can get too oily</li>
            <li> My race is Black mixed with a small amount of Native American.</li>
            <li> Before I purchased this product I read several reviews and made a few comparisons to other products.</li>
            <li> So I Assume in a very shocking matter that these products are seriouslly and truthfully working!!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical and the smell didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> I mix this with the other Hesh herbal hair oils and apply it to my scalp about every other night.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions of some of the other reviewers here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> and I ventured into some other products.</li>
            <li> Then I went to an Idian Food Store ways away from my house and got all the rest of those other products Ive named so that I can just try them all out.      </li>
            <li> I MIX IT WITH MY OTHER OILS FOR NOW</li>
            <li> This product is the only product I can find that actually keeps my hair feeling hydrated all day, also I&#x27;ve noticed the breakage has decreased and my hair is getting longer again.</li>
            <li> And the oil itself can be a little messy and drip down your back eyes</li>
            <li> , I guess I just wanted to wear it down or in ponytails like the other girls.</li>
            <li> I am now noticing that my hair is dry and not easy to comb, my scalp is itchy and the luster that was beginning to develop is now fading away.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have found this oil earlier because honestly I do not use anything else but this product now.</li>
            <li> So I just greased my scalp with that Vatika oil (twice a week for 2 weeks) and wrapped it every night never washing it out until every 2 saturdays ill start the whole process all over again.     </li>
            <li> I use the oil on my scalp as a massage and also down the hair shaft for strength.</li>
            <li> I had it down to a science.</li>
            <li> scalp screamed yippee and laid down without a fight.</li>
            <li> After using it for about three days, my hair was so bouncy, shiny and held up my hairstyle longer than any other product I have used !</li>
            <li> WELL DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR TIME ON OTHER PRODUCTS....</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product for about a week and a half now</li>
            <li> I saw growth in less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> And yes, it does have an odd smell to it.</li>
            <li> I never rinsesd the Vatika oil out because I&#x27;m Black with a drop of indian in my blood</li>
            <li> No more \\&quot;rough ends.\\&quot;    4.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Shikakai oil for a little over a month</li>
            <li> The rest of the oils listed are beneficial, but the mineral oil makes me a little weary.</li>
            <li> TO WHO EVER TRIES THESE PRODUCTS !!!</li>
            <li> If you are curious to try it and do not like the product, at least you won&#x27;t be out of a bunch of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for a few months and it seems to be working.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brand names including a brand named Banyan that everybody raved over, that was literally stuck in my hair and made my hair shed...YUK!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure if all 2 inches are because of the oil</li>
            <li> Since using the oil, my daughter has no more flakes.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it works</li>
            <li> Not sure if it helps to grow my hair</li>
            <li> Not for me, too oily....smells like oil and very heavy.</li>
            <li> I also have noticed it is less weak than before.</li>
            <li> The smell is worse than Jamaican Black Castor Oil.</li>
            <li> Later that night, parts of my head starts to itch a little which isn&#x27;t a bad thing.</li>
            <li> I would at least once a week</li>

            <li> I was a little disappointed because the 2nd ingredient listed is mineral oil.</li>
            <li> This product has saved my hair &amp; now I can keep it has long as I want it w/o thoughts of cutting it.</li>
            <li> I transitioned by cutting off the relaxed ends little by little.</li>
            <li> , it wasn&#x27;t a bad smell but a smell all the same.  </li>
            <li> AND IT&#x27;S THE SECRET TO INDIAN</li>
            <li> It has a thin consistency and spreads through the hair well.</li>
            <li> Omg stinks so bad smells exactly like curry chicken and syrup.</li>
            <li> Usually by now I would experience SERIOUS breakage, but NOT NOW!!!  </li>
            <li> Then I slacked off b/c I got bored</li>

            <li> IMO, it doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as some reviews state.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not so bad.</li>
            <li> It breaks my hair, and the smell is really bad in my opinion.</li>

            <li> I tried another homemade brand of Shikakai Oil; terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> it leaves my hair really dry, and every time i use it my hair gets weak and it is breaking a lot more than before. i have naturally texturized hair</li>
            <li> This oil is very good for the scalp if you don&#x27;t mind the distinct smell. It was not unpleasant, however, it lingered a bit. I use it for scalp massages.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil since 11/07/14 on weekdays only and it seems to be working nicely. It&#x27;s now 11/25/14 and I believe my hair has grown 2 inches. I&#x27;m not exactly sure if all 2 inches are because of the oil but I know that one inch was definitely from it. I have 3b curls I think and it works! Before I go to bed I put the oil on my scalp and massage for 3-4 minutes. It don&#x27;t wrap my hair at night but I put it up in a bun and it doesn&#x27;t get all over my pillow . The oil DOESNT SMELL BAD!!! It smells like curry. Which is good. I&#x27;ll write another review to update but so far I think this stuff works like it should. definitely buying again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit of an oil junkie and was very pleased when I recieved this herbal oil. The texture is light and the scent is both masculine and feminine. (Reminds me of the scent of strong maple syrub marriaged with fragrant overtones.) It has a noticible different scent, but is not offensive or pungent. The scent becomes lighter on the hair as the day progresses and is fragrant throughout the day. I was impressed with the price and the amount. If you are curious to try it and do not like the product, at least you won&#x27;t be out of a bunch of money.</li>
            <li> MINERAL OIL  is the SECOND ingredient on the list. This information is not disclosed in the store front product description before you make the purchase.......Very misleading if you think you&#x27;re getting All Natural Ingredients. NOT SO! and I&#x27;m DISAPPOINTED</li>
            <li> The oil works great it&#x27;s not heavy and a little goes along way . And it does promote fast hair growth. My hair always grows 1/2 inch every month like its supposed to , but with this it&#x27;s doubled ! I would recommend for someone who is looking for a oil to keep their scalp healthy while reaping the benefits of growth.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product for about a week and a half now and i&#x27;m already seeing amazing results. My hair is so soft it feels like silk ! it&#x27;s also doing wonders for new growth as well. My hair has grown out about 1/4 inch already.I&#x27;m telling you guys this product works!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product now for about 6 months and my hair is thriving. I use the oil on my scalp as a massage and also down the hair shaft for strength. I LOVE IT! My hair was right above shoulder length when I started using the product, and now it is past my shoulders full and thick, and I&#x27;m constantly getting compliments on how healthy my hair looks.    I am relaxed with 4a/b hair and I swear by this oil and the powder. I have tried other brand names including a brand named Banyan that everybody raved over, that was literally stuck in my hair and made my hair shed...YUK!!! I always drift right back to Hesh because I reap the fruits of my labor with strong healthy looking hair that doesn&#x27;t shed when I rinse the product out like the Banyan did. The smell takes some getting use to, but beauty is pain! I make a paste every 4 days with the powders mixed in with my conditioners and I am so excited at how my hair is progressing.     I highly recommend them both.</li>
            <li> Stinky, stinky stinky but I still mix it with my henna.  I use shikakai shampoo now so I&#x27;ve really laid off the oil except for henna mixes.  I love the results I&#x27;m getting...my hair is so much stronger and full.</li>
            <li> I really do love this product. At first I was skeptical and the smell didn&#x27;t help. This product has a really herbally and a bit soapy smell to it, but it can be toned down if you mix it with other oils you like. I massage this product through out my hair and scalp, put a conditioner cap on, and leave it in over night. The next morning I shampoo it out and condition my hair like normal. It leaves my hair nurished and strong. My scalp feels cleaner too.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It only gets a 4 because j an not a fan of the smell, and it has mineral oil in it.  However, despite both of these things, j still use it bug only the night before washing my hair.  I use it in conjunction with my brahmi oil for hair oiling.  Since using, my hair has increased thickness and body! I definitely have more hair growth... a major growth spurt that&#x27;s still going!  I will definitely purchase again as this is now a staple in my hair regiment!</li>
            <li> Significant Hair  growth since using this product. Use it daily as conditioner. Love it.</li>
            <li> This oil is the miracle hair growth. IMO, it doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as some reviews state. I saw growth in less than 2 weeks. This is a staple and I&#x27;m a customer for life!!!!!!!!! Please do not discontinue</li>
            <li> I have been using this hair tonic for about 3 weeks now.  I have seen some growth...but will write a better review at a much later time.  I purchased this item based on the reviews (pro and con) about the product.</li>
            <li> it is very nice hair oil I would love it if didn&#x27;t have Mineral and Veggie oil in it after all it is great on hair it makes my hair smooth and soft!!!!</li>
            <li> The oil isn&#x27;t greasy on the hair but the fragrance is very pungent. I don&#x27;t think that I would purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Ok but didn&#x27;t find out the fuss for these products. They are kinda messy, I brought all of the different kinds in oil and powder. I don&#x27;t see what all the fuss is about these products. Maybe I didn&#x27;t stick with them long enough because of the smell, mess and time consumption with these products. Will try to use them up as time permits to free under sink area.</li>
            <li> 1.  I am African-American.    2.  I purchased the product primarily for use on my 10-year-old daughter&#x27;s hair and scalp.  She had an extremely dry scalp with flakes of dead/dry skin.    3.  Since using the oil, my daughter has no more flakes.  Her hair is amazingly soft and feels strong and healthy.  No more \\&quot;rough ends.\\&quot;    4.  If you use a hot comb or flat iron, the oil protects the hair well from heat damage.    5.  I am absolutely pleased with this outstanding product.  I love the results.</li>
            <li> I believe this product has helped my hair to grow! I would recommend giving it a try!</li>
            <li> I got this oil  just last week along with the brahmi amla oil, I have to say it works. I mixed them both as a prepoo overnight. My hair used to shed a lot especially when wet. I used to be afraid to comb my hair. This oil smells ..but my hair loves it. No breakage, none. MY hair is relaxed and I&#x27;m looking foward to using these amazing oils. I just have to get used to the smell..</li>
            <li> I have been using Shikakai oil for a little over a month and I love it!  I was natural for about three years until I had my hair permed last month.  Usually by now I would experience SERIOUS breakage, but NOT NOW!!!  My hair is so strong and healthy. I use this in addition to the paste every couple of days, and my hair is really thanking me for it! I&#x27;m so glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> Before I purchased this product I read several reviews and made a few comparisons to other products. In all I did my research. My friend has recommended for years that I use Amla oil but totally forgotten about it until recently when I&#x27;ve been experiencing extreme hair loss &amp; dryness. I&#x27;m 100% Puerto Rican with I&#x27;m guessing Type 3B hair. I&#x27;ve always said it was that in between type of hair that&#x27;s a curly mess if not managed properly. I read up on a few articles that the oils in this product is great for those who have gone natural from hair relaxing. I&#x27;ve been natural for over two years and my hair is pretty long however it started to become dry &amp; unmanageable. After using this oil in my hair twice..it has given life back to my hair, now it&#x27;s very manageable again &amp; soft. I can easily comb my hair without worries of clumps of hair loss. This product has saved my hair &amp; now I can keep it has long as I want it w/o thoughts of cutting it. Yes, the smell is a lil pungent, that roasted tree bark scent or as my Trini friend would call it \\&quot;Curry Punjabi smell\\&quot;. Hey, I don&#x27;t care what it smells like..it keeps my hair lovely long, well nourished and manageable.</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;ve ordered it recently and started using it as soon it arrived. I love this product. The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me since I&#x27;m already familiar with similar smells because of my Caribbean background. (Barbados &amp; Guyanese) When I applied it to my hair, it made my hair softer. Later that night, parts of my head starts to itch a little which isn&#x27;t a bad thing. I guess, also that sensation means it was working. I would also buy this product again!! Best oil I&#x27;ve found so far!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for a few months and it seems to be working. I have very dry brittle hair and so it breaks frequently. This product is the only product I can find that actually keeps my hair feeling hydrated all day, also I&#x27;ve noticed the breakage has decreased and my hair is getting longer again. While this oil does have a smell it is not overbearing. I will definitely keep using this oil.</li>
            <li> The smell of this product is way to strong and can be very over powering, which is a major set back.  And the oil itself can be a little messy and drip down your back eyes etc if applied to much. I mix this with the other Hesh herbal hair oils and apply it to my scalp about every other night. Then I place a satin bonnet on my hair. I have been using the oil for about two weeks now. So it is much to soon to say if this product works and promotes hair growth. One thing I like about the oil is that it makes my hair soft and easy to manage in the morning and even at two weeks I am starting to notice less hair breakage, which is a major plus. I am going to wait six months before I write another review, since hair grows 1/2 per month. Another thing about this oil is that it is non-gresy and the oil itself dissolves into your hair. If you don&#x27;t mind the over powering smell, and if you have time to give yourself a oil treatment that can be somewhat time consuming then I recommand trying this product.</li>
            <li> This prodcut is an excellent conditioner. It really does condition the hair from root to tip leaving it very soft and it smells incredible. It has notes of indian lilac when my mother smelled the fragrance on me, she asked me what was it and i told her about this product. ALso what i like about this product is that it does not leave the hair greasy for the product absorbs very quickly. The best results are to leave it on over night and yes i did notice the hair start to grow, no greasy build up and no dandruffs.Overall excellent product.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product smells. It sort of smells like lilacs. It&#x27;s not to greasy. A little goes a long way and it lasts for a long time. This product really works for conditioning the hair and helping it to grow longer with great shine and manageability.</li>
            <li> I originally made a review for this product when I first bought this product but I felt that I should make another review since it has been 8 months since I have had this product. I am an African American women who one day cut off all my relaxed ends and decided to become natural. This oil has allowed my hair to heal from the inside out. The one thing that I wanted was for my hair to be HEALTHY not necessary long anymore. And this oil has helped my hair become healthy and to my surprise increased my HAIR GROWTH DRAMATICALLY. I just mix this oil with sublime sulfur powder and I cant stop my hair from growing. And not only is it growing but it is growing HEALTHY&amp; LONG but also THICK AND RAPIDLY. I can no longer stop my hair form growing. Even if I trim my ends, my hair continues to grow so much. But the one thing that I must say that I love about this oil is that it has taught me how to love my hair once again. I catch myself taking my time and massaging my hair and scalp with love. I wish I would have found this oil earlier because honestly I do not use anything else but this product now. All other hair products are useless and the product junkie in me is now dying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing I must say is that the smell is very strong but if you want to learn to LOVE your hair you must get this product. You will begin to understand that not everything is for hair once you buy this oil. You may be like me and use it solely. I hope this helps in anyone&#x27;s search for the best product/oil for their hair!</li>
            <li> I bought 5 bottles at once, with great expectations. Based on the reviews i read. But i was disappointed,i didn&#x27;t see any growth. I still have 3 unused bottles left. After about 3yrs of purchase. So disappointing!</li>
            <li> I really love this oil because it makes my hair soft and shiny, it has a distinct odor but it&#x27;s not overwhelming. My hair has grown quite a bit since using it. I definetly will be purchasing this oil again.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product! Its not greasy or smelly like everyone else said! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and I see some growth, surprisingly! A little goes a long way. The bottle is good for the price and it was shipped within the given time. After using it for about three days, my hair was so bouncy, shiny and held up my hairstyle longer than any other product I have used ! I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who wants their hair to be longer and stronger!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******UPDATE*******&lt;br /&gt;Hello, I&#x27;m back! :)&lt;br /&gt;I just recently washed my hair and flat ironed it and it looks soo much longer. I have only used it about 15 times in the pass 3 weeks and my hair is now pass my shoulders and my hair use to be between my shoulder and ear ! This product is amazing!!</li>
            <li> This Herbal Hair Oil made my hair very manageable.  Although it did do for my hair what I wanted it to do sometimes I felt like I was walking around smelling like a curry kitchen, it wasn&#x27;t a bad smell but a smell all the same.  I still use Ancient Formulae oils just a different scent.  The Amla enriched Herbal Hair Oil is now my go to hair oil.</li>
            <li> Omg stinks so bad smells exactly like curry chicken and syrup. I applied this once i could smell it all day!</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for a week now, and it does everything it said it would! My hair is so soft and shiny, I am almost out of this stuff already! I also have noticed it is less weak than before. I honestly don&#x27;t know why some people hate the smell so much, I love it. It smells warm and like herbs, I am actually wearing it right now. This oil has definitely helped my damaged hair recover (I have Caucasian hair, which is wavy and 24 inches long). I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants long beautiful hair!</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed because the 2nd ingredient listed is mineral oil. It has a smell, but they recommend you apply it @ night, the odor disipates by the morning. I a few drops in hot oil treatments, just to use because I paid for it. The rest of the oils listed are beneficial, but the mineral oil makes me a little weary.</li>
            <li> This oil made my hair shinier softer healthier and it was beginning to grow. I have 3c/4a textured hair. I stopped relaxing my hair in Sept 2007. I transitioned by cutting off the relaxed ends little by little. I purchased this product in September 2009 after doing intense research on Ayurvedic type hair products. Anyway I ordered the Shikakai Oil along with some Maka and Bhrami powders. I followed the instructions of some of the other reviewers here on Amazon. The powders are quite messy but effective. When I first tried the oil it was overwhelming because I was a little heavy handed with my application. I definitely had to lighten up on my scalp. I used the oil consistently for a month. Then I slacked off b/c I got bored and I ventured into some other products. Well I def should not have done this b/c I am now noticing that my hair is dry and not easy to comb, my scalp is itchy and the luster that was beginning to develop is now fading away. I am so mad with myself. As a result of this set back I started back using the Shikakai Oil about 2 nights ago with the hopes that I can regain the results that I had once achieved. Foolishly I was tempted by the fruit of another! I tried another homemade brand of Shikakai Oil; terrible. I should have stuck with my routine...I had it down to a science. Oh and another thing, while using this oil my hair had COMPLETELY stopped shedding...COMPLETELY. Of course I messed it up and now it&#x27;s shedding all over the place. I didn&#x27;t give the oil a chance but best believe I am back on my grind oiling my hair every other night and doing my powder mixes once a week. I can tell it&#x27;s getting soft again already. The smell of this oil was strong at first but all of a sudden it&#x27;s not so bad. Maybe because I know the benefit and I&#x27;ve blocked it out who knows, who cares. Usually I am not a fan of mineral oil being in my hair products but it&#x27;s not negatively affecting my hair at all. Bottom line stick with what works for you in order to achieve results; don&#x27;t give up. This works for me and I am so excited! I will be ordering more of this oil, prob 2 or more bottles. I have to keep this in stock just in case they decide to discontinue the product one day.</li>
            <li> I cannot wait for the results, it is definitely all natural and I will definitely recommend this oil to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  whenever I use this my hair turns to a rich black.  its shiny and grows fast.</li>
            <li> This oil was every thing it said it would be. And yes, it does have an odd smell to it.I added it to coconut oil. It&#x27;s a nice light oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it works but it does stink very very much. I guess u could get used to it but I haven&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I love this oil...I use it as my prepoo and it lets my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> EVERYONE I SWEAR THIS PRODUCT IS THE NUMBER ONE BEST STUFF TO USE!!!! Iam a Cosmetologist that just graduated from Cosmetology School. I love long hair and love to care for long hair. My race is Black mixed with a small amount of Native American.I am 26years old now. Since I was 3 years old my Grandma started to briad my hair alot, I hated getting my hair braided lol, but she got it to grow to my shoulders doing that. I stopped wearing braids in my hair when I reached 9 years of age, I guess I just wanted to wear it down or in ponytails like the other girls. Well anyways, every since I had my Grandma stop braiding my hair, seems like since that age I stopped, my hair was always stayed at that shoulder length on up to my adulthood.  Anyhow, I&#x27;ve always wanted to know whats wrong with my hair and why doesn&#x27;t it grow any longer than that. I kept my ends clipped every 6 months of split ends, I did know that heat can damage your hair, infact, I put NO heat on my hair at all for yeeeeaars, i always kept my scalp and ends greased, ive done hot oil treatments every 6 months, I only used no-lye olive oil perms once a year becuase I still wanna be as natural still but be able to manage it. After going to Cosmetology School the mystery was solved. Comes to find out that humans hair all have some sort of resting stage in life meaning that our hair comes to a point of stop growing past a certain length no matter if your doing all those things to it to keep health and growing.     Well one day I was wacthing a show about native americans and a question popped into my mind. I said, I WONDER HOW DO THE INDIAN WOMEN GET THIER HAIR TO BE SOOOO LONG AND HEALTHY??? So I thought that was a great question to ask myself and so I went and grabbed my laptop and set down and googled it (for real!!!). Once I googled it, their were hair products names coming in everywhere from this site to the next. I kepy seeing people raving about \\&quot;Shakakai oil by Dabur, Shakakai powder by Dabur,Shakakai shampoo and conditioner by Dabur, Amla Oil by Dabur, Vatika coconut hair oil by Dabur, neem powder by Dabur, neem oil by Dabur,Maka powder by Hesh, and Sulfur Sublimed powder by Perferred Plus Pharmacy. Man I was reading each and evrybody&#x27;s comments on each and everyone of those products and they were all good comments espeacially on Shakaki oil/Vatika/Amla oil. I thought....WOW could this stuff really be working?!! Have I found a Miricle to make my hair grow?!?!? I was a little skepticle and decided about 1 week later and went on Amazon.Com to order the Shakakai oil, Amla oil, and Sulfur Sublimed Poweder. Then I went to an Idian Food Store ways away from my house and got all the rest of those other products Ive named so that I can just try them all out.      Well I began using the Shakakai oil, Sakakai shampoo/conditioner, Sulfur Sublimed Powder, and Vatika Oil on a saturday 04/23/2011, the day before tho- I used the Shakakai oil all over my entire scalp doing a circular massaging motion on my entire scalp with the oil, This stuff smells like some strong seasoning spices and curry lol, But I wrapped my hair up and tied it with a silk scarf. The after day.... before rinsing the Shakakai oil out, I took two table spoons of the Sulfur Sublimed Powder and mixed it with a cup of warm water, I stired it up for a while until the powder was all dissolved. Next I put that mixture all on my scalp massaging it in that same circular soft motion on my scalp. I than let that sit on my scalp for about 2 to 3 hours. Next, I rinsed it all out with warm water, then, I used the Shakakai shampoo/conditioner twice to a third time to give it a good clean. Then I blow dryed it and pressed my hair. After I was done pressing my hair, I used the Vatika coconut hair oil on my entire scalp and massaged that into my scalp. I never rinsesd the Vatika oil out because I&#x27;m Black with a drop of indian in my blood lol so I need something on my scalp thats a oil that&#x27;ll keep my scalp moist. So I just greased my scalp with that Vatika oil (twice a week for 2 weeks) and wrapped it every night never washing it out until every 2 saturdays ill start the whole process all over again.     RESULTS: It&#x27;s now 05/20/2011 and for some strange reason everyone of my friends and family have started playing with my hair running thier hands and fingers through it saying, \\&quot;WOW your hair was just at you shoulders three weeks ago and now its down to your upper back, how do you keep it so healthy, what type of products are you using on it?!?!?!\\&quot; LOL, I couldn&#x27;t believe my ears from all the wow&#x27;s that my family and friends were saying. So I Assume in a very shocking matter that these products are seriouslly and truthfully working!! MY HAIR THAT I COULD NEVER EVER HAVE GOTTEN TO GROW LONGER THEN MY SHOULDERS SINCE THE AGE OF 9 YEARS OLD HAS FOUND ITS MIRICLE FOR GROWTH NOW!!!!! MY HAIR WON&#x27;T STOP GROWING FOR NOTHING!!!

            <li> I&#x27;m a blatino with.combi hair; the Africans,puerto ricans,and Cubans we&#x27;re just wild. the.first treatment was amazing.&lt;br /&gt;my scalp screamed yippee and laid down without a fight. oh yeah.&lt;br /&gt;after.some extensive research I found it works best along with the shikakaisoap.one persons.review.wasn&#x27;t favorable,but she obviously did something incorrect.&lt;br /&gt;purchase both and you judge my words.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it helps to grow my hair but I don&#x27;t put it on all the time either. It smells like curry but doesn&#x27;t last after a few hours. I love the smell of curry.</li>
            <li> Good oil. Kind of a strong smell through.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this.  You have to be careful about amount you put on because hair can get too oily but I think the smell makes up for that!</li>
            <li> It does not work for me. It breaks my hair, and the smell is really bad in my opinion.I don&#x27;t like this product at all.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T THINK I WILL ORDER AGAIN ONLY BECAUSE IT IS MADE WITH MINERAL OIL I MIX IT WITH MY OTHER OILS FOR NOW</li>
            <li> Okay.. bought this product after hearing that it helps hair grow.  I&#x27;m 100% black and this thing is REALLY making my hair grow..it&#x27;s just growing..and growing!  My hair was at my shoulder and now it&#x27;s on its way to my mid-back!  I use this along with brahmi amla oil and it is a miracle worker.  Every night I mix the two oils and put in my hair and run my oiled fingers in my roots!   Then I do a a big single indian braid and tie it down with a silk wrap.  The scent is quite strong and unpleasant at first..kind of like tree bark, but now I love the scent..it&#x27;s sort of soothing now..lol!      This stuff works..and my hair doesn&#x27;t look thin while growing!  It is stronger and more lusterous.  I also use the Amla and shakakai powder as well.  The day before I use the powders,  I wash my hair and I heat up the amla and shakakai oils plus castor, olive, and carrot oil..then I rub it all in my damp hair..do a single braid and sleep in a shower cap...then wash it out the next morning.  I then mix the two powders together with water and I was told to leave on my hair for an hour or more..its been working like a charm! So happy!</li>
            <li> This product works fine for your hair if they are dry, however it says to put it on and leave it on overnight...I couldn&#x27;t do that! The smell is so strong that I couldn&#x27;t sleep.  I was consireding to turning it back because of the smell but first I decided to try to leave it on during the day when I am at home. This is way better!  It nourrishes your hair and let them smooth and shiny.  The shipping cost is very high, but the bottle lasts very long.</li>
            <li> love this oil the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me because I love exotic spicy smells, but I can understand why some can&#x27;t get used to it. The scent is strong and lasting, but the benefits from the oil exceed the smell in my opinion. When my hair was natural I used it after shampooing to twist or braid out. Made my hair extremely soft. My pillowcases hated it though. Be sure to protect anything you rest your hair on. Can be used as a hot oil treatment and works well if you use it to blow dry.I would recommend blow drying hair at 70% then putting it on to finish blowing out.</li>
            <li> When I first opened this product, a wonderful smell emerged from the bottle. It makes my hair shiny and soft. Be careful not to use too much product, it will make hair greasy.</li>
            <li> I was using this from mid July to now (past mid Sept). Would put it on my scalp and massage in, as the instructions said. I would at least once a week but with no extra growth or anything. DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> has an unusual smell but is not smelly its like an organic type of oil and is light and i apply to scalp and its sleek and will work as a hair strand seperater i apply and flat iron it leaves hair shiny and lays the hair not really a thickener but it will be light wieght and you can have light curls</li>
            <li> Good company.They delivered on time.I tested a patch of this oil.It made my hair really soft and shiny.Cant wait to give another update!</li>
            <li> while there are a lot of good things in this product, and i really wanted to try it, i can&#x27;t bring myself to use it. i&#x27;ve been searching for all natural products, and making my own as well. the product description doesn&#x27;t list the actual ingredients, and i think that should mandatory for all online marketplaces. the main ingredient is vegetable oil, number two is mineral oil, which i don&#x27;t want on my body at all, then a few good things, then a few more bad things, and a few bad dyes and things. i can&#x27;t speak to the efficacy of the product, because i didn&#x27;t try it, but if you&#x27;re looking for an all natural, plant-based product, this is not it</li>
            <li> Not for me, too oily....smells like oil and very heavy.</li>
            <li> Product didn&#x27;t work for me shedding continued with my hair.</li>
            <li> A little really goes a long way. I used it twice. The smell is worse than Jamaican Black Castor Oil. I love castor oil. It smells like something burnt than burnt. So horribleeeeeeeeeee. Never will i purchase this again..</li>
            <li> I was looking for good hair oils to moisurize my split ends. This product is decent. It has a thin consistency and spreads through the hair well. I mainly used it on my frizz, and split ends &amp; it helps.</li>
