            <li> Tips are to sharp they scratch</li>
            <li> I got from the fade blade; however they made the clipper extremely loud--loud enough where I couldn&#x27;t hear the clipper cutting the hair.</li>

            <li> Bought these clippers years ago. Had to replace the blade a few times, but they work perfectly. Best clippers I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery! Item just as described!</li>
            <li> I love this blade cuts hair with such precision. Great buy!!</li>
            <li> 1 year later, still sharp with moderate use.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. Perfect fit for my andis master clippers. Last pair lasted a very long time. i expect this one to do the same.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Cuts great but rusted after I used the spray cleaner on it. Not sure if that is normal.</li>
            <li> Switched the blade on my fade masters..does a decent job.  Must keep oiled.</li>
            <li> I bought this blade to replace the fade blade on the Fade Masters because they pulled the heck out of my scalp. This 1556 blade did an ok job at reproducing the fade I got from the fade blade; however they made the clipper extremely loud--loud enough where I couldn&#x27;t hear the clipper cutting the hair. I&#x27;m not a pro barber therefore I rely on the sound of the clipper cutting hair as well as looking at the taper in the mirror. If you&#x27;re used to the Andis Master clippers then of course this blade will work as a replacement (its the exact same blade), but if you&#x27;re like me who wanted to replace the fade blade on the fade masters, don&#x27;t. Stick with the fade blade and just go slow, use oil, and make sure the blade is flat against the scalp.</li>
            <li> I dropped my Andis masters and the teeth broke. This is an exact match replacement and works like the orignal.</li>
            <li> New and sharp. Just what the barber ordered!</li>
            <li> Needed it...shipped quick, good product.</li>
            <li> It arrived with burrs on the skin side of the clippers. I ended up using the moving part not the outside.</li>
            <li> No it did not, one of the teeth chipped a week after I started using it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the fademaster, but the blade was way too pointy (like needles). The tips were actually biting into my skin and lifting it. These blades fit the same clipper, and is perfect for me. I just zero gapped them, and ready to go!</li>
            <li> Great Blade. Works as expected. Adjustable on Andi&#x27;s Master for 3 different cuts.</li>
            <li> works great! Thank you for the great service</li>
            <li> Best quality! Make sure to get spray so it doesn&#x27;t mess the  machine up n rust as well</li>
            <li> Brand new&lt;br /&gt;Low price&lt;br /&gt;exactly what I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;All in all I am pleased with this product and would consider future purchases</li>
