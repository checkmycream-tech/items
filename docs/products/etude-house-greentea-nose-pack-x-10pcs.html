            <li>It has a refreshing sensation to it, but it doesn&#x27;t take out everything.</li>

            <li>More Nose pack</li>
            <li>i really love these strips.</li>
            <li>I have been using biore pore strips and it does ok..</li>
            <li>and i like the smell too..:)</li>
            <li>I love them :) they leave residue which can easily be washed off.</li>
            <li>I also received two free samples and a coupon in the box, 3 diff kinds of bb cream, some panda magic handcream and a coupon for circle lenses on pastelnoodles.</li>
            <li>Love this took the black heads off its the best.</li>

            <li>In exchange the scent of these was strong, maybe a tad too much for my liking.</li>
            <li>I washed my skin with warm water to open up the pores and the strip really got the gunk out of my nose.</li>
            <li>so I know exactly what is in these.</li>
            <li>Besides the residue it leaves after you take it off, It works very well~!</li>
            <li>I really like these nose strips!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved the smell of green tea!</li>
            <li>Really does  not work at all...</li>
            <li>They do have a herbal like smell but it doesn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
            <li>They worked very well.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t work very well for me.</li>
            <li>and i was surprised at how this pore strip works for me.</li>
            <li>I used these nose strips a few times, before switching to another brand, because they didn&#x27;t seem to be strong enough, they barely pulled out any dirt or blackheads.</li>
            <li>It is also kind of difficult to remove the sticky substance after removing the pad.</li>
            <li>They work just as well as any other strip that I have tried, but dry much faster!</li>
            <li>and she seemed to really enjoy because it isn&#x27;t a tough as the biore pore strips</li>
            <li>With other pore strips I have found that the dry time is always MUCH longer than what is on the directions.</li>

            <li> Compared to other nose strips, these are about the same.</li>
            <li> With other strips I have an issue in the same spot on my nose</li>
            <li> After you dampen your skin you apply the strip and wait until it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> I would suggest using them a few times a week until you clear the black heads</li>
            <li> The shape was another little problem, it just didn&#x27;t work out for me, as the strips were too wide at the sides, so they always ended up getting to close to my eye area.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t help too much.</li>
            <li> I have two complaints: (1) the strips are green and it is difficult to see what they were able to remove, (2) part of the strip still stuck to my face when I tried to remove it.</li>
            <li> I know whiteheads are deeper and pore strips don&#x27;t usually take them off</li>
            <li> so I am probably doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> Also the pricing is a bit off, these are too expensive for being just okey.</li>

            <li> Did a fantastic job the first time, simply okay after that. I use them about once each week. Compared to other nose strips, these are about the same.</li>
            <li> Love this took the black heads off its the best.</li>
            <li> I bought these pore strips thinking it would remove the whiteheads I get on my nose but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t help too much. I know whiteheads are deeper and pore strips don&#x27;t usually take them off but I don&#x27;t know I thought it would help a bit. I ended up giving these away to one my friends since I don&#x27;t get blackheads and she seemed to really enjoy because it isn&#x27;t a tough as the biore pore strips and she has sensitive skin so this turned out awesomely for her. :)</li>
            <li> Rather good, when you pull it off you can see what you took out! It smells really nice and isn&#x27;t too strong, it also has a very cute packaging! I also received two free samples and a coupon in the box, 3 diff kinds of bb cream, some panda magic handcream and a coupon for circle lenses on pastelnoodles. I reccomend!</li>
            <li> Really does  not work at all...remove nothing...</li>
            <li> Love these! I prefer these over the store and name brand ones. they get everything out of my pores! They do have a herbal like smell but it doesn&#x27;t really bother me. I wish the ingredients were listed somewhere though in English so I know exactly what is in these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the smell of green tea! Besides the residue it leaves after you take it off, It works very well~!</li>
            <li> nice，that&#x27;s second times i bought</li>
            <li> They worked very well. I recommend them!</li>
            <li> It gets the job done. Nothing special.</li>
            <li> These are good! I love them :) they leave residue which can easily be washed off. And it comes with a free sample! The smell is okay.</li>
            <li> smells nice and removes blackheads well. :)</li>
            <li> I really like these nose strips! After you dampen your skin you apply the strip and wait until it&#x27;s dry. I washed my skin with warm water to open up the pores and the strip really got the gunk out of my nose. What I liked most was the scent and feel of the strips. They have a minty-herbal tea scent and feel really cool on the skin!</li>
            <li> They leave a residue after use and I can still see gunk in my pores.  They don&#x27;t work very well for me.</li>
            <li> Great product! Works well!</li>
            <li> It has a refreshing sensation to it, but it doesn&#x27;t take out everything. It is also kind of difficult to remove the sticky substance after removing the pad.</li>
            <li> Yow!!&lt;br /&gt;These strips work, trust me.  I used one last week and it grabbed all the junk in my pores and pulled it out.  I would suggest using them a few times a week until you clear the black heads up then for routine usage.</li>
            <li> Works super well, probably won&#x27;t get them again though</li>
            <li> I love these. My nose feels cleansed and refreshed after every use.</li>
            <li> I like these strips and will continue to use them. They work just as well as any other strip that I have tried, but dry much faster! With other pore strips I have found that the dry time is always MUCH longer than what is on the directions. That is not the case with these strips! They are scented so if smells bother you I would not recommend these. I didn&#x27;t enjoy the smell, but I didn&#x27;t dislike it either. I have two complaints: (1) the strips are green and it is difficult to see what they were able to remove, (2) part of the strip still stuck to my face when I tried to remove it. With other strips I have an issue in the same spot on my nose so I am probably doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product I received,the little coupon I got and pandas dream white hand creams were amazing l. I&#x27;d They Sale The Panama Cream I Will Definitely Buy From Theo AND More Nose pack</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> i really love these strips. I have been using biore pore strips and it does ok.. i saw this online and read the reviews, i thought why not..lets try it.. and i was surprised at how this pore strip works for me. i have never had this result with biore.. totally pulls out all the white heads off my nose.. and i like the smell too..:)</li>
            <li> These are my favorite nose strip, they even smell good!</li>
            <li> I used these nose strips a few times, before switching to another brand, because they didn&#x27;t seem to be strong enough, they barely pulled out any dirt or blackheads. In exchange the scent of these was strong, maybe a tad too much for my liking. The shape was another little problem, it just didn&#x27;t work out for me, as the strips were too wide at the sides, so they always ended up getting to close to my eye area. Also the pricing is a bit off, these are too expensive for being just okey.</li>
