            <li>The iron is cheaply made, I would not purchase this iron again.</li>

            <li>Overall pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>but I love this one so much that im using this one all the time.</li>
            <li>It was delivered early which is always nice.</li>
            <li>works good, gets really HOT FAST, its like the Royal straightener works fast on curly hair</li>
            <li>it works awesome no need to go over the same spot numerous times</li>
            <li>, this one gets very hot...</li>
            <li>I did not notice any burning to my hair or pulling on the ends, it was very gentle to my hair!</li>
            <li>I am going to try integrating some type of protecting spray or oil into my beauty routine because 500 degrees is HOT!</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a good, not extremely expensive flat iron for a while.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I did find that my hair catches less in the plates than with other irons and after many passes my hair does look great!</li>
            <li>I love how my hair turns out with this flat iron, its smooth and perfectly straight and warms up fast so touching up my hair in the morning</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to have as a back up, but I will be buying another Sedu as my main straightener.</li>
            <li>The very first day I got this I washed, blow dried, and then finally straightened my hair with this and was instantly impressed.  </li>
            <li>Just like the other customer, I found this iron to be of exceptional quality.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair so smooth and soft!</li>
            <li>It gets hot quickly and makes her hair so shiny and straight.</li>
            <li>Amazingly better then the regular Chi in my opinion.</li>
            <li>so you can control how much heat you want on your hair!</li>
            <li>I would buy this again and tell a friend on how hot it gets and</li>
            <li>It gets really hot, if goes up to 500 degrees and it has temperature control.</li>
            <li>it works the first time</li>
            <li>and I love the different temperatures so you can adjust it.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more and I will definitely be recommending it to others,</li>
            <li>It is a nice weight, a long cord to plug into the wall , and seems very sturdy</li>
            <li>If you have curly/kinky hair make sure not to set the temperature above 400 degrees because it damages your curls.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I instantly fell in love with this product as soon as I took it out of the box it was shipped in.</li>
            <li>It gets plenty hot, really fast.</li>
            <li>The straightener heats fast and makes my hair bone straight!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love my new flat iron!</li>
            <li>it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Heated up fast</li>
            <li>and it was straight...</li>
            <li>so you can straighten your whole head.</li>
            <li>my hair is really curly.</li>
            <li>The temperature goes up to 500° and works really really well on my hair.</li>
            <li>and it went from curly to straight with 2 passes.</li>
            <li>recommend highly!</li>
            <li>which is something everyone wants or needs.</li>
            <li>Her hair is shiny and straight.  </li>
            <li>It also curls really well.</li>
            <li>and they came up so fast</li>
            <li>This hair straightens better than any other straightener I have used.</li>
            <li>I do like this flat iron a lot, BUT, decided to give it 4 stars since I found that although it gets pretty hot (I&#x27;m not 100% convinced it gets as hot as it says it does )</li>
            <li>I was so excited thinking technology finally changed enough to bring the price of a good, high quality, professional straightener down.</li>
            <li>it leaves my hair perfectly straight and soft...</li>
            <li>and I normally use 2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>READY TO USE HOT IN APPROXIMATEly ten seconds</li>
            <li>It is, however, very clunky and suffered significant damage when I dropped it which is hard not to do because the long cord is easy to get caught in.</li>
            <li>The flat iron seemed to be flimsy construction, the width of the flat iron plates were narrower than described, and there was no way to gauge an accurate temperature on the dial.  </li>
            <li>Just as good, if not better than the Chi and other salon-grade competitors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had a chane to use this once so far, but my hair looked very shiny and sleek.</li>
            <li>and all I needed was one pass over my naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>This is by far the nicest straightener I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>Bebella Premium Pro Professional 1.25&amp;#34</li>
            <li>This straightener left my hair really straight.</li>
            <li>Heats evely and straightens my natural hair in one pass.</li>
            <li>As far as the product goes, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>I have very curly coarse hair</li>
            <li>In no way did it appear to be a professional model, as touted in the website write-up.  </li>
            <li>They definitely will be useful  in my daily regiment for my hair!</li>
            <li>I have very course hair and a lot of it, so I require a Brazilian blowout plus, a flat  iron.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a decent flat iron to use on my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>The iron is good when it works but every time I replace an order of six irons I have to get at least two of them that are not working at all!!!</li>
            <li>It left my hair soft, shiny, and silky.</li>
            <li>Have to go over hair several times, then it never really gets the root straight.</li>
            <li>Gets so hot, though, it makes my hair stiff when I straighten it.  </li>

            <li> I have been searching for a good, not extremely expensive flat iron for a while.&lt;br /&gt;This one rocks! My hair is very thick and I normally use 2&amp;#34; flat irons. The 1.25&amp;#34; works wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;Also, this one gets very hot...which I must have. PERFECT!!!!&lt;br /&gt;One of my favorite features is the swivel cord. I have a tendency of wrapping the cord around the flat iron which eventually shorts it out. The swivel feature will prevent this~!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li> I love this straightener! I&#x27;ve had it for about a month now and my hair feels softer and looks great every time I use it!</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Heated up fast and all I needed was one pass over my naturally curly hair and it was straight... Amazingly better then the regular Chi in my opinion. Sadly I did drop it once but no chips and it still works perfectly... Will buy for my niece</li>
            <li> It was a great buy for the price</li>
            <li> Got it less than 10 minutes ago, and once again im my wife&#x27;s hero. SPEEDY DAMAGE FREE TRANSPORTATION. READY TO USE HOT IN APPROXIMATEly ten seconds have to say I myself am thoroughly amazed.</li>
            <li> love the product...! it leaves my hair perfectly straight and soft... and I love that it arrived way before then what It was specked :-) I recommend this ion with more then 5 stars :-)</li>
            <li> This is by far the nicest straightener I&#x27;ve ever owned. I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing hair straightener. I was very pleasantly surprised that one glide was enough to straighten my thick stroke of hair. Very good product for a very good price!</li>
            <li> I do like this flat iron a lot, BUT, decided to give it 4 stars since I found that although it gets pretty hot (I&#x27;m not 100% convinced it gets as hot as it says it does )I don&#x27;t find that I am going over the same sections of hair any less than with any of the other flat irons I&#x27;ve had in the past (this iron claims to lessen the amount of passes needed to straighten each section)- my hair is neither overly thick or curly. I did find that my hair catches less in the plates than with other irons and after many passes my hair does look great! I would buy this again, however I might possibly give another iron a try, too. Overall pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my new flat iron! I have very course hair and a lot of it, so I require a Brazilian blowout plus, a flat  iron. It has an adjustable heat knob so you can control how much heat you want on your hair! I definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants to have great hair!</li>
            <li> I have very course, thick hair. I straighten my hair every day and have done so for about 12 years now. I bought this straightener after my Sedu went out. I was so excited thinking technology finally changed enough to bring the price of a good, high quality, professional straightener down. Nope, not yet. It says it gets up to 500 degrees... However my Sedu only got up to 450 and it&#x27;s still hotter than this one. It&#x27;s good to have as a back up, but I will be buying another Sedu as my main straightener.</li>
            <li> Just like the other customer, I found this iron to be of exceptional quality.  Just as good, if not better than the Chi and other salon-grade competitors. It gets plenty hot, really fast.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be  smoother since it rated well.</li>
            <li> Best flat iron I ever had. Made hair very straight and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> works good, gets really HOT FAST, its like the Royal straightener works fast on curly hair I would buy this again and tell a friend on how hot it gets and the heat is what does the job, just don&#x27;t leave it on the hair for to long, or you&#x27;ll burn the hair</li>
            <li> Great product that gets the job. It&#x27;s small enough to take traveling and big enough so you can straighten your whole head. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a joke. Have to go over hair several times, then it never really gets the root straight. It pulls hair too. Hate it. Wish i hadn&#x27;t used it, so i could return it!</li>
            <li> Used once. Just feels heavy and awkward</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so smooth and soft! Never had another straightener do this. Always had to go over sections over and over and my hair would look terrible, dry, brittle. With this one 2-3 times and my hair was great, even the next day with no go over. Seriously thinking of getting another because I know my daughter will take this one</li>
            <li> Bebella Premium Pro Professional 1.25&amp;#34; Onyx Plates Hair Straightener Flat...  BEST FLAT IRON EVERY &amp; I LOVE THE COLOR :)</li>
            <li> Love my bebella! I have gray wavy hair that I color and this flat iron is so efficient!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American my hair is really curly. This straightener left my hair really straight. It gets really hot, if goes up to 500 degrees and it has temperature control. If you have curly hair try you&#x27;re gonna love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hair straightener. I got this as a back up because my other one is messed up  but I love this one so much that im using this one all the time. it works awesome no need to go over the same spot numerous times it works the first time and I love the different temperatures so you can adjust it. I also love that they had to colors to choose from. I will be buying more and I will definitely be recommending it to others,</li>
            <li> I used this flat iron on my daughters thick 4c hair, the iron did not get the hair straight without multiple passes. The iron is cheaply made, I would not purchase this iron again.</li>
            <li> Arrived ahead of schedule and works great so far. Had it for almost a month. Heats evely and straightens my natural hair in one pass. Almost like still being relaxed.</li>
            <li> No better than one you can get at Walmart for less</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my sister for Christmas. It comes in a beautiful box and the purple is so beautiful too. It gets hot quickly and makes her hair so shiny and straight. Her curls last all day when she uses it to curl her hair. At the price for that quality, I&#x27;m really glad I got it for her.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my proliss straightener. It was delivered early which is always nice. As far as the product goes, I couldn&#x27;t be happier. It is a nice weight, a long cord to plug into the wall , and seems very sturdy (I&#x27;m rough on my hair styling appliances). It beats in 10 seconds as advertised which is wonderful. The temperature goes up to 500° and works really really well on my hair. I have very curly coarse hair and it went from curly to straight with 2 passes. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. For the price, it surpassed my expectations. Recommended.</li>
            <li> This flat iron was a disappointment!  In no way did it appear to be a professional model, as touted in the website write-up.  The flat iron seemed to be flimsy construction, the width of the flat iron plates were narrower than described, and there was no way to gauge an accurate temperature on the dial.  I&#x27;ve had a quality flat iron in the past.  This isn&#x27;t one.  I immediately sent it back for a refund.</li>
            <li> This is the best straightener I have purchased ever. If you have curly/kinky hair make sure not to set the temperature above 400 degrees because it damages your curls. The straightener heats fast and makes my hair bone straight!</li>
            <li> I received my iron 2 days after ordering and immediately tested it out. I have not perked y hair in almost a year because they were thinning my hair out. I am African American and have thin coarse hair, the straightner makes it look like I just got a fresh press/blow out. Love this product</li>
            <li> Love it! Best straightener I&#x27;ve had so far.</li>
            <li> i love this flat iron - one of the best i&#x27;ve ever owned.  recommend highly!</li>
            <li> I really and truly love these flat irons, they are the best and being I am a licensed cosmetologist, I must say that the price &amp;#34; omg &amp;#34; is a cheat , I mean these flat irons are no less than 45.99 on ebay and that&#x27;s with bidding, but the ceramic plates are amazing with leaving the hair shiny and silky straight which is something everyone wants or needs. But Its a must that I give this dealer / Flat iron a 10 star if it was possible , but I could only give 5 stars so I&#x27;ll say times the five stars x2 . ITS A MARVELOUS PRODUCT AND THE SHIPPING WAS ON TIME &amp;#34; I&#x27;M A HAPPY CUSTOMER &amp;#34; THANKS :) :) :)</li>
            <li> My wife is very happy with the product</li>
            <li> this straightener is the best. I love it.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a decent flat iron to use on my daughter&#x27;s hair. She has very thick hair with 4a/4b curls. We do not flat iron it very often, so I didn&#x27;t want to buy a really expensive flat iron when we only use it 3-4 times a year. This flat iron did an excellent job on her hair. I followed the advice of another review and bought the comb to do in combination with the flat iron. I was able to do one pass with almost all of her hair.  She and I are both very happy with the results. Her hair is shiny and straight.  With only doing one pass, I do not have to worry about heat damage.</li>
            <li> shipped out to me fast/Great seller/Love this purple-its my fav color! I have not tried it out yet but as long as it makes my hair smoother, shinier, &amp; I can curl or straighten-I am good! Thanks! This seller ROCKS!!!!</li>
            <li> The iron is good when it works but every time I replace an order of six irons I have to get at least two of them that are not working at all!!!</li>
            <li> Great straightener!!  Would recommend...great price</li>
            <li> I instantly fell in love with this product as soon as I took it out of the box it was shipped in. I could tell this product was quality by just the packaging it came in. It was nice, beautiful, and simple. Unboxing it was one of the most fun parts for me. They even give you a nice glove! (Although I will probably never use it haha).&lt;br /&gt;But on to the product itself. The very first day I got this I washed, blow dried, and then finally straightened my hair with this and was instantly impressed.  It left my hair soft, shiny, and silky. And that is exactly what I want being biracial (half black and white). While I was using this product on my hair I did not notice any burning to my hair or pulling on the ends, it was very gentle to my hair! And I think I can thank the ceramic/onyx plates for that. I used it at about 200 degrees Fahrenheit which I think was perfect, because this straightener gets up to 500 degrees which honestly will fry anyone&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am VERY pleased with this product and I can tell it will last me a long time if I take care of it properly, which I plan on doing. Well worth the $40!!!!! :)</li>
            <li> Bought this hair straightener for my daughter on December 19, 2014.  It had good reviews and we thought it would be a good purchase.  Today is April 20, 2015.  One of the plates has come loose and is falling off.  Don&#x27;t buy it.  It won&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and extremely effectively!  Gets so hot, though, it makes my hair stiff when I straighten it.  Would work wonders on coarse hair, and I can&#x27;t wait to get a friend with hard-to-straighten hair to see if they want to use/have it!</li>
            <li> I usually have to use a straightening comb before using curling irons or flat irons on my hair and I don&#x27;t have to using these. It takes a lot less time to do my hair now!</li>
            <li> Works okay, but nothing special.</li>
            <li> Best flat iron I have ever owned! Heats up quickly and takes so much less time to straighten my hair compared to any other flat iron I&#x27;ve tried and its less damaging. It also curls really well. Awesome product!</li>
            <li> i would recommend this to anybody who has thick hair.it went  straight through mine.</li>
            <li> Omg I couldn&#x27;t wait to try these out! unbelievable price and they came up so fast, I love the purple package it comes in and I couldn&#x27;t wait to get my hands on them I tried them today on my hair and my daughters hair and it works absolutely fantastic! They definitely will be useful  in my daily regiment for my hair!</li>
            <li> Good product for the price! works well</li>
            <li> Love it leaves my hair super straight, its the best, it heats super fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had a chane to use this once so far, but my hair looked very shiny and sleek. I am going to try integrating some type of protecting spray or oil into my beauty routine because 500 degrees is HOT!</li>
            <li> The only straightener I have your that works in my hair! Absolutely love!!!</li>
            <li> This hair straightens better than any other straightener I have used. It is conveniently designed and hair doesn&#x27;t get stuck between the plates as it did for other straighteners I have owned. It is, however, very clunky and suffered significant damage when I dropped it which is hard not to do because the long cord is easy to get caught in. Don&#x27;t drop this straightener and you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when I saw price a $200 dollar flat iron on sale for $25. I gave it a shot and am so happy I did. I have extremely curly hair and every flat iron I used from the drug store just left my hair a flat fuzzy mess. I love how my hair turns out with this flat iron, its smooth and perfectly straight and warms up fast so touching up my hair in the morning is easy and quick.</li>
            <li> Wow i just got the package and the box is beautiful ,I used the flat, iron it&#x27;s fantastic, I hope it stays as amazing as now so I don&#x27;t need to change my review about it.. .lol</li>
