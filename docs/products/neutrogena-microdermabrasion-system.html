            <li>It is a very easy product to use and allows application of the moisturizer without getting your palms and fingers all greasy!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena products for years and have liked most of them, but this one is the very best.  </li>

            <li>Would recommend as a good cleanser.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product referred to me by a good friend.  </li>
            <li>LOVED THE SYSTEM .</li>

            <li>Good for the skin</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much I loved it until I run out</li>
            <li>Probably not the greatest product for the face, as it is originally intended.</li>
            <li>This stuff is really good, but it comes out a bit too pricey since you do have to replace them after each use, so I docked a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greetings from beautiful Armenia. :)</li>
            <li>They exfoliate your skin efficiently and your skin looks great the more you use them.</li>
            <li>YAY so many and great price.</li>

            <li>Was requested by my daughter and she was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I think the price is good, the results are amazing</li>
            <li>Amazon has the best price if you are able to take advantage of their free shipping offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Just use it twice a week and your skin will feel so much better!</li>
            <li>Love these use and toss!</li>
            <li>I love these !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I purchased the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion System!</li>
            <li>The first time I tried the product, I was impressed with the after look.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite Microdermabrasion puffs!</li>
            <li>We Love it  !</li>
            <li>i love it!</li>
            <li>but i have found that one or two of those puffs to be more harsher and abrasive than the rest!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and very handy</li>
            <li>This device is a great alternative to paying huge prices at the spa</li>
            <li>but product amazing</li>
            <li>amazing results when using it with the Neutrogena microdermabrasion machine.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin look and feel amazing.</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best thing a woman can do for her skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a hit and miss chance of finding them in stock in my area so the convenience of being able to order them on line is great, to be able to get them cheaper is defiantly a bonus.</li>
            <li>I guess each to their own</li>
            <li>so easy to use, clean perfect my oily sking</li>
            <li>I own the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion  System so I must have the refills.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a cost effective way to boost surface cell turnover for firmer, younger-looking skin.</li>
            <li>Really good product, my skin looks really better now than before</li>
            <li>Kind of spendy</li>
            <li>A nice replenshisment of the pads used with the device I saw on Dr. Oz&#x27;s program.  </li>
            <li>These are refills, so you need to get the contraption that goes with them, but the whole set up is awesome.</li>
            <li>i love this product i feel i am not getting &#x27;cheated&#x27;  for not spending boo coo bucks on the &#x27;good&#x27; stuff...</li>
            <li>Product came on time and was packaged nicely</li>
            <li>I think the product is good, but very strong, so I can&#x27;t use it more than x2</li>
            <li>one day I decided to check out Amazon , in a matter of minutes, I found exactly what I wanted and they work great and for a good price.</li>
            <li>Clean air helped as well as great spring water.</li>
            <li>Great product and not to much soap in the pads which is a really good thing.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re the sort of person who does a better job brushing their teeth when using an electric toothbrush -- the novelty of a gadget somehow makes you more invested -- this might be a good way for you to wash your face.</li>
            <li>the pads are excellent, after 1 use my skin felt smooth and fresh.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I really love this effective product and it helps me with my skincare routine.  </li>
            <li>It is an amazing product and I find it better to use my hands in scrubbing than the electric thingy.</li>
            <li>The combination makes my skin smooth and bright.</li>
            <li>Now it is more cost effective to purchase these from the store.</li>
            <li>Best price for these refills on the internet as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Easy does it\\&quot;!  </li>
            <li>When I first used this product, it worked great, but after a while my breakouts were unmanageable.</li>
            <li>I have had the Neutrogena system for several months and these puffs are excellent at keeping my skin smooth and bright.</li>
            <li>as perfect as always love getting this product plenty of refills for awhile, the packaging is great nothing gets messy</li>
            <li>I feel like its helping make my complexion smoother, fine lines are dissapearing and ooo my, when I am done I feel fresh and beautiful.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling very smooth after use.</li>
            <li>My moisturizer seemed to soak right in after using the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion System - sooooo nice!  </li>
            <li>works great, makes your skin super smooth and even out skin tone...</li>
            <li>I love this product it leaves your skin very smooth</li>
            <li>it feels.&lt;br /&gt;it comes with a nice cleanser in the pads that makes fine soap suds and smells good.&lt;br /&gt;easy</li>
            <li>This is a good price for a nice large package.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>

            <li>I love Olay products too, but Neutrogena has them beat with this one.</li>

            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love these pads.</li>
            <li>My skin is softer smoother and looks healthy.</li>
            <li>it means that my skin is producing so many cells that it cant shed them and therefore my pores get clogged.</li>
            <li>I am in love.</li>
            <li>I really love the results I&#x27;m getting from the microdermabrasion system, but</li>
            <li>I like being able to just toss the pads when you&#x27;re done using them.</li>
            <li>I ordered 24 more pads.</li>

            <li>LOVE this product though, and it is so inexpensive you CAN afford to pamper yourself with this product.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite beauty products.  </li>
            <li>but this product is great for the whole family.</li>

            <li>They work great and offer a deeper treatment than my exfoliating crime (Queen Helene which is great, and much better than other OTC brands because it is more fine-grained).</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend it if your face breaks out easily</li>
            <li>Honestly I don&#x27;t like the soap very much</li>
            <li>Very pleased getting 24 pads for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>In general I am not so great at taking care of my skin</li>
            <li>This works fine for not being pricey.</li>
            <li>I liked the product it never fails to give my face a smooth glowing finish.</li>
            <li>Adhesive worked just fine for all 24 pads.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena made this little toy that is perfect to use on your skin  to help with complexion and smoothness of the surface.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for helping me prevent breakouts since I do wear light coverage foundation daily.</li>
            <li>The micro abrasion system exfoliates the skin, leaving it silky smooth.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so smooth and brighter.</li>
            <li>Loves these puff pads, great refill for my neutragena facial cleaner</li>
            <li>This kit is fantastic forn the at home microderm abrasion results.</li>
            <li>Really doing a nice job of cleaning my pores and making my skin look smoother...love it</li>
            <li>Prior to these, I used an apricot scrub which was great,</li>
            <li>Great results in a short period of time.</li>
            <li>They are a great daily cleaner for me (age 42).</li>
            <li>I have light acne breakouts which improved</li>
            <li>and I also refuse to spend $300 on a clarisonic, this always leaves my skin smooth and &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Exfoliates, makes skin smooth and it glows afterwards.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this product.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy to see these back on the market!!  </li>
            <li>But also, they lived in the country and grew their own veggies and ate really well...</li>
            <li>These are a great addition to my weekly facial skin care.  </li>
            <li>This product did smooth my skin</li>
            <li>The meds I use go on smoother and my skin looks and feels fabulous.</li>
            <li>This product makes your skin smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>After use my face feels smooth and conditioned.  </li>
            <li>enjoy the way</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone looking to smooth and brighten skin.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>I follow with vit E or light almond organic oil after useage.</li>
            <li>So my mom bought these for herself and its makes her skin so smooth</li>
            <li>It came with an extra head attachment which turned out to be awesome as my mom accidentally threw out the one the whole system can with</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen some of the benefits they say you can get at this point, but I am pleased with how smooth and fresh it makes my skin.  </li>
            <li>The pads work nicely in the comfort and convenience of your own home, saving a lot of money to the spa for a facial.  </li>
            <li>They lather up good and leave my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve found my skin stays pretty happy and beautiful lately because I do just one thing with consistency</li>
            <li>I tend to think my skin is fair and sometime sensitive.</li>
            <li>really makes my skin feel smooth and soft after a good treatment on the weekends!</li>
            <li>however 24 puffs and that price its very useful.</li>
            <li>find it very necessary and feels great and clean.</li>
            <li>The cream wasn&#x27;t heavy, it rinsed clean and after a treatment, my skin had a wonderful even texture and a glow.</li>
            <li>Skin feels great, and extra clean.</li>
            <li>These refills fit the original product well and does the job intended.  </li>
            <li>now maybe she can scrub her face and make it look fresh and clean again!</li>
            <li>, so I think I&#x27;m spending significantly longer cleaning my face with this than I would if I were just rubbing a face</li>
            <li>However, they are awesome on my neck, upper chest, and feet; also, I find these do not need to be tossed after each use (probably just the company&#x27;s way to sell you more stuff), and seem to last a while.  </li>
            <li>Left my skin radiant and healthy looking after first use!!!!  </li>
            <li>i use it about onces a week make my skin feel really clean</li>
            <li>The results are super smooth clean skin.  </li>
            <li>Leaves a nice soft and smooth feeling after drying.</li>
            <li>It rinses well and leaves me with a clean face.  </li>
            <li>I like to steam open my pores and use really warm water on the puff just to try to get the most out of this product.</li>
            <li>Great product, really gave my face a deep clean!</li>
            <li>I use these almost every other day to help exfoliate and it makes my skin beautiful.</li>
            <li>Received these right away - from across the country!</li>
            <li>Even at my most lazy I can spare 3 minutes to run this over my face and that&#x27;s a win.</li>
            <li>Good facial cleaning pads.</li>
            <li>I love this product my skin feels and looks so much smoother and softer.  </li>
            <li>I already have the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion system and I love that these refills aren&#x27;t very costly.</li>
            <li>Love the product, but it might be cheaper in a real store?</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Other than that, great product!Will order again..</li>
            <li>IT MADE MY FACE FEEL REALLY CLEAN AND FRESH</li>
            <li>It keeps my face clean and feeling fresh.....</li>
            <li>So since I already had the Neutogena handheld machine thing I thought I&#x27;d give the microdermabrasion pads a try for a quick fix.</li>
            <li>would recommend this product to anyone looking to add a mild dermabrasion product to their beauty regime.  </li>
            <li>so I go through puffs quickly.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take the place of a peofessIonal microdermabrasion treatment but is a nice substitution when you have no other options.</li>
            <li>These pads are the same kind as the ones that originally came with the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion system.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I did give the product a chance by using them every other day for 2 weeks just to see if it was the formula working to smooth out my skin and remove any impurities but the flakiness did not stop.</li>
            <li>Since I started using this product however, my face has produced and excreted more oil than normal.</li>
            <li>I was a loyal and delighted user of the original version of this product: an exfoliating cream used with a dense foam sponge head that fit the same machine as the new pads do</li>
            <li>I love how clean and soft my face feels.</li>
            <li>They clean your face very well and my face is silky smooth and works  </li>
            <li>Pleased that a new attachment was included with the Puff Refills</li>
            <li>I am 30 years old and have been using this system consistently for almost 2 months and my skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I am getting super-duper microderm abrasion, but it does a pretty good job and my face is not beet red, so that is a plus.  </li>
            <li>This refill pack last a long time and its an awesome value to buy this size.</li>
            <li>I recently started using this Neutrogena Microdermabrasion System and absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>The 24 count puff refill pack means I am not rushing back to the store for more quite as often!</li>
            <li>Definitely one of my favorite beauty products!</li>
            <li>This is a better deal than Walgreen&#x27;s has usually not the case.</li>
            <li>Really does help lessen fine lines.</li>
            <li>my skin tone is more even, and there is a definite decrease in fine lines.&lt;br</li>
            <li>works really well, not hard to use at all start seeing results with in two weeks and very fast and effective</li>
            <li>After use, my face feels super clean, smooth, and soft.</li>
            <li>They really seem to help smooth my skin without any discomfort or irritation.</li>
            <li>they smell good and have soap in them that works when you wet them.</li>
            <li>So simple and effective</li>
            <li>I get th perfect grade of exfoilant thats stronger than a regular scrub but gentle enough not to damage my skin.</li>
            <li>l love these thanks ; fast shipping</li>
            <li>i just bought 6 months worth of the the refills.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Buy the system, its totally worth every dime.</li>
            <li>I also used this product after returning from a tropical vacation - my skin was peeling a bit (too much fun in the sun), and this product cleaned, smoothed, and polished my skin to reveal a sunkissed glow.  </li>
            <li>smile lines are less noticeable and my skin looks remarkably</li>
            <li>My older skin needs more exfoliation than younger skin to keep it looking fresh and healthy.</li>
            <li>My skin works better with the orange Neutrogena Wave Deep Clean Exfoliating Pads</li>
            <li>Dr. Oz got this one right.  </li>
            <li>The soap embedded in the puff is just the right amount to cover my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>I had read about this system and was eager to buy it and start using it right away.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this Neutrogena product for a couple years now &amp; I will continue to purchase it as long as it is available :)</li>
            <li>This machine is very easy to use and the instructions are simple.</li>
            <li>This machine is very easy to use and the instructions are simple.</li>
            <li>Love this product, visible results in 1 use, amazing product and after a few days of usage my skin feels really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Skin feels super smooth after and stays soft for days after.</li>
            <li>With these pads, I can just stick one on and quickly scrub my face in or out of the shower, no mess, nothing in my eyes, and my face always feels so smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>Simple, easy to use, it gets the job done!</li>
            <li>Great alternative to much more expensive machines and procedures.  </li>
            <li>It feels good on my face because its like a massage and helps less bumps on my face.</li>
            <li>Was thrilled to see that these pads fit, and tried them a few times.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use refills, microdermabrasion system leaves my skin feeling soft and glowing.  </li>
            <li>My pores are clear, which has never happened, my frown mark on my fore head is almost gone, and my skin is soft and bright and clear!!</li>
            <li>I would recommend it very much.</li>
            <li>The refills are exactly like the ones in the store, but cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I was glad to find the refills on Amazon and about $3.00 cheaper than my local Wal-Marts.</li>
            <li>Be sure to start off only 1x a week to allow your skin to adjust then increase to 2x.  </li>
            <li>Luminous change after the first use, soft and smooth skin.</li>
            <li>I could tell a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li>These microdermabrasion puffs are better and cheaper than a facial.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it my face felt smoother....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last 4 months and love the way my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li>use this in the shower, and I scrub first my forehead</li>
            <li>The Microdermabraion system is gentle on the skin and leaves your face feeling fresh and renewed.</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>it works really well!</li>
            <li>These work exactly as intended.  </li>
            <li>Helps prevent breakouts, by really cleaning your face!</li>
            <li>never changed from the first time I ever laid eyes upon them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this Neutrogena product since 2004 and it makes my face smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>I love the entire Neutrogena microdermabrasion system.  </li>
            <li>I have seen this product at a higher price at the pharmacies.</li>
            <li>Refills work well as usual, very happy with entire product.</li>
            <li>purchased these for my sister and from the first usage she noticed the immidiate changes.  </li>
            <li>because I am satisfied, I saw a difference on my face.people tell me I look younger.</li>
            <li>I felt a softer skin after the first use.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>and I tried it for the first time yesterday before I went to rehearsal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These pads leave my skin smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a bit of discomfort and heat sensation on first try but on my succeeding use I didn&#x27;t experience it anymore.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I really like this product!  </li>
            <li>My skin looked clean, luminous and very soft.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think these pads have any magical chemicals in them that clean my face better or worse than bottled face cleansers.</li>
            <li>This is the only stuff I use, I use my hand to apply because I prefer more control and pressure that way, my face feels clean and soft...</li>
            <li>This product is used with a special hand held massager that you must purchase separately, as these are only the refill pads and not the full microdermabrasion system.</li>
            <li>This product makes your skin so clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>I too use 1/2 squirt of neutrogena face soap, \\&quot;after you use it the first time the soap is pretty much gone.</li>
            <li>My face since the first time you can really see the difference.</li>
            <li>a shame that in order to make a few extra bucks, Neutrogena ruined what had been one of the most effective skin care systems on the market.</li>
            <li>The puff refills are fine but you could easily skip buying the little machine.</li>
            <li>These are great and are hard to find!</li>
            <li>I run the puff (already applied to machine) under hot tap water before and during use so that the machine glides smoothly over my skin throughout the entire process.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you lotion up your face afterwards or it will dry up</li>
            <li>these aren&#x27;t so easy to find in stores anymore, so that is the only reason why it gets 4 stars.</li>
            <li>The novelty certainly works for me.</li>
            <li>New in Box and used it right away.</li>
            <li>I am honestly starting to feel that these reviews are overly positive and are hugely</li>
            <li>it cleans your skin very well and it helps you from breaking out</li>
            <li>Really makes a difference</li>
            <li>It is much smoother, softer and even-toned.</li>
            <li>thanks you.</li>
            <li>I use this about twice a month or when my face feels really grungy.  </li>
            <li>It exfoliates really well.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really Amazon sold health and beauty items until recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All thanks to my microdermabrasion system and puffs.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>(you have to order the whole system again).</li>
            <li>I know that when I use it I SHOULD NOT APPLY TO MUCH PRESSURE.</li>
            <li>and it works very well.</li>
            <li>One of the issues is that the pad is VERY abrasive and TOO MUCH oil was removed with each use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see any difference yet</li>
            <li>Intense, Day Lotion, Day/Night Lotion and Eye Cream.  </li>
            <li>I want to say thank you because my skin has really changed and has lightened up and has brighten the</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not using and I really appreciate what you all did for me</li>
            <li>but the results are very noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The pads really polish away imperfections</li>
            <li>but I really like the results of a smoother skin.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I prob use them too much</li>
            <li>I have really missed my face scrubby.  </li>
            <li>so haven&#x27;t seen to much</li>
            <li>Will absolutely order this product again when needed.</li>
            <li>Works even better than expected with Neutrogena&#x27;s Microdermabrasion System.</li>
            <li>This is one really works.</li>
            <li>The next day, my moisturizer and makeup glided on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>and I still HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li>they really work well with the microdermabrasion system.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena brand pads, the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very nice.carefully package</li>
            <li>really works.</li>
            <li>My skin is much smoother after each use and the puffs are not too</li>
            <li>Fast shipment.</li>
            <li>I have been using these pads with the attachment for 5 yrs and highly recommend!</li>
            <li>You really feel as though you are getting a deep clean.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find the system to be something that I particularly give much value.  </li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old formula and sponge gave outstanding results, and the half-inch thick foam applicator made it easy to get into the contours of my face.  </li>
            <li>every other day I just put a new washing pad and my face feel clean and also my pores have gotten smaller, making my make up look much much better.</li>
            <li>so my skin stays pretty clear.</li>
            <li>Came early and is exactly as described</li>
            <li>You feel the smooth, fresh feeling instantly and for me that instant gratification is the draw</li>
            <li>I was glad to see a slightly reduced price on amazon.  </li>
            <li>The refill puffs have returned at a decent price of under EIGHTEEN BUCKS for two months of treatments.  </li>
            <li>Found these and based on some of the questions/reviews, decided to give it shot and &#x27;hoped&#x27; that it would work with my older unit.  </li>
            <li>I use each of the puffs twice - there is more than enough product on the puff to use a second time.  </li>
            <li>dead skin cells from my face leaving me with a good overall feeling.  </li>
            <li>The texture of my skin is smoother &amp; so very soft!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone wishing to improve and maintain their appearance.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this system.</li>
            <li>is that they were a little more exfoliating.</li>
            <li>and I did not mean to order two mini pad because I don&#x27;t want a lot of somethings around that</li>
            <li>Glad to see these little pads.</li>
            <li>I think you could take just the little circles of face sanding paper and do a better job than this vibrating handle.</li>
            <li>I have so much more confidence all thanks to this little guy!</li>
            <li>but it is so popular, its hard to find it on the shelf in my neighborhood.</li>
            <li>It was very nice that the lady on the other end of the phone believed me &amp; sent me another&lt;br /&gt;order to replace the missing one .</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll, the attachment snaps right onto my older unit and definitely cheaper to use than going to the spa or using the sponge pads.  </li>
            <li>But because there is no thick foam to cushion your face anymore, you can&#x27;t treat the creases around your nose, or your brow line without the edges of the disc scratching your skin.</li>
            <li>Nice way to know you are getting scrubbed; especially because I work outside gets just gritty at times</li>
            <li>Looks fresh and younger after each use.</li>
            <li>It does leave my face feeling fresh and I actually have gotten a couple of comments about my face looking brighter.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty much the same as directed</li>
            <li>I use St. Ives green tea exfoliant, so I thought this product would help do the job better.</li>
            <li>Love these especially for dry winter skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new on this product, I&#x27;ve discovered recently, and I feel I&#x27;m going to love it for a long time!</li>
            <li>But I got it right finally and used the rest correctly.</li>
            <li>Using the microderm system in combination with vitamin oil like almond oil or vitamin E, I find that the dark marks vanish very quickly.</li>
            <li>I must say again, I can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel brand new.</li>
            <li>I would buy a new one every time, but I don&#x27;t want to contribute to the landfill.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and in described new condition.</li>
            <li>This is a great alternative to harsh scrubs, and I have re-purchased these scrubber refills a few times now.</li>
            <li>it helps me to remove dead skin and makes my face clean without any grease or oil upon it; I will definitely order some more in the future.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you could get the same results for cheaper if you put the same amount of time into scrubbing using a decent facial scrub and a washcloth</li>
            <li>Now I am back to purchasing them from a local store since they are no longer available on Prime.  </li>
            <li>my dermatologist said this system could help with old acne scars- after 2 weeks of use, no results yet, but I&#x27;ll give it a few more months-</li>
            <li>Although my skin felt soft and more firm after each use.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive but the puffs do not irritate my skin at all</li>
            <li>When I do find it in a drug store or specialty department store, it is priced far too high.</li>
            <li>This product makes my skin feel very soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Whatever your skincare product, this removes old skin and prepares your skin to accept and absorb product!  </li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using this system for the past 3 months....</li>
            <li>These work better than the more expensive brands!</li>
            <li>This system is better than the more expensive ones!</li>
            <li>This takes care of the problem, and leaves me feeling sooo soft!</li>
            <li>Gentle enough but feels like it really does slough off the old skin.  </li>
            <li>Usually I&#x27;m not the type of person to write a review</li>
            <li>My skin is so much better when I use this vs when I&#x27;m lazy and don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I am a pretty big health nut and juice, take vitamins, workout, etc</li>
            <li>The new head fits the old handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that you can really feel and see the difference after few uses.</li>
            <li>I enjoy taking the time for a little mini face massage and cleansing.  </li>
            <li>Product is very good but the packing was bad.</li>
            <li>I really love the  product that you have online- for a little while I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere in my area and had to search for it elsewhere; finally, I found it on the Amazon website.</li>
            <li>As far as the system itself goes, I really notice a difference in my skin when I use this regularly.</li>
            <li>I bought this system to clear up my oily acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>Would definately recomend this to anyone looking clear up their skin (after a breakout) and to lessen their oily skin.</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>but I only use them every 2-3 days and really noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>Since I started using this, my skin looks soft and youthful.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the old lady hands anymore.</li>
            <li>Pull those old Neutrogena Rejuventors and Microdermabrasion Systems off the shelf.</li>
            <li>and i have sensitive, oily acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>Skin feels soft and renewed after use.</li>
            <li>I have had this for about 2 years now and it makes my face feel so soft</li>
            <li>I am 48 and people think I am in my early 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li>My skin has cleared up and it feels soft.</li>
            <li>Sensitive for your skin.</li>
            <li>However when I found it on Amazon, I was surprised.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product since I was 19 yrs old</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>So far I like it.</li>
            <li>I think it looks a whole lot younger than it did</li>
            <li>This package of refills seems old or something.  </li>
            <li>No need for professional facials with this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am 55 and have the skin of a 30 year old.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the disc is dampened with water, it foams...and the user exfoliates her face using the machine as with the old method.  </li>
            <li>but my skin is just too sensitive for it.</li>
            <li>far I&#x27;ve been using it once a week</li>
            <li>After use, my skin feels so soft and I am gradually noticing that my skin looks healthier.  </li>
            <li>or if it&#x27;s sensitive.</li>
            <li>Wow, I have tried every product on the market and never had results like this.</li>
            <li>I bought the original Neutrogena kit some years ago and felt that the brush was a little too gentle on my oily, coarse skin.  </li>
            <li>After 4 weeks of use of the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion system with these pads, my skin is smoother and my dark areas are fading (I also use Ambi Fade Cream which is also by Johnson and Johnson, but the microdermabrasion seems to be speeding up the process because it never worked this quickly before).  </li>
            <li>I should say that my skin is not super, super sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and seriously recommend it...  </li>
            <li>I apply a hot wash cloth to my face prior to treatment to open pores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a typical acne sufferer either.</li>
            <li>also moist spot in the middle, is that normal??</li>
            <li>Takes a little bit for the cleanser to come out but don&#x27;t feel as though it is a quick treatment anyway.  </li>
            <li>I do make sure I am careful&amp; lift up a little 4 A smoother glide with no pull.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a very harsh old-lady perfume, or the smell of cheap hairspray or laundry soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I usually have enough of the product still on the pad when I use it the 2nd time, but by the 3rd or 4th time I put my own cleanser on the pad and then use it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After rinsing, I just couldn&#x27;t get the oily feel of the new product off my face; it is NOT the same cream as before, except for the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I have used scrubbing cloths that, for me, seem to work better with less fuss and mess.</li>
            <li>I have always had fairly good skin, but at 71 it seemed to look a little dry and the texture was a little different on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>morning, I noticed that my sun spots/freckles on my face are half missing or have lightened up by more than 50%... and my 2 sun spots on my left hand have been erased completely!</li>
            <li>They seem much rougher on my skin than usual and they don&#x27;t seem to have much cleanser in them.  </li>
            <li>And, if any of the plastic textured area becomes exposed, it&#x27;s like scrubbing your face with a cheese grater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the treatment for the same number of minutes as the old formula, and ended up breaking capillaries around my nose and on my checks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this product is too abrasive to use on the regular basis if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Then when I did they were kind of expensive.</li>
            <li>The product is great but these pads seemed to be a little dried out when opened and do not foam up like the past boxes I have bought in stores.</li>
            <li>A little pricey to use on a regular basis, but worth it.</li>
            <li>And a little acne, too, which at my age proves to me that exfoliation and increased blood flow is definitely happening.</li>
            <li>If you cannot handle any roughness against your skin, then you may have a different experience -- better or worse than I.</li>
            <li>It is a bit harsh and abrasive on older, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The first several I put on the applicator upside down as the gritty side is very coarse.</li>
            <li>I only use it every other sunday because I exfoliate daily, but I really like the product.</li>
            <li>, Neutrogena usually get it right when it comes to skincare.  </li>
            <li>My feeling was that instead of doing agreat job of exfoliating and leaving a natural glow like the old cream did, this new system did a half-assed job of exfoliating and just left an oil slick behind to fool the eye that my face was smooth.  </li>
            <li>I think that the refills should be less expensive considering that the whole kit is only about 3-5 dollars more.</li>
            <li>I like this product because after I used it with the little device you put it on it made my face feel really soft.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>I found that using it three times a week for me is a little too much.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> but I bought these after hearing how wonderful they were and I do love them.  </li>
            <li> The Neutrogena healthy skin rejuvenator is a great product!!</li>

            <li> It is a very easy product to use and allows application of the moisturizer without getting your palms and fingers all greasy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena products for years and have liked most of them, but this one is the very best.  </li>
            <li> Rest all good.</li>
            <li> Would recommend as a good cleanser.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product referred to me by a good friend.  </li>

            <li> Good for the skin</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much I loved it until I run out</li>
            <li> Probably not the greatest product for the face, as it is originally intended.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really good, but it comes out a bit too pricey since you do have to replace them after each use, so I docked a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greetings from beautiful Armenia. :)</li>
            <li> They exfoliate your skin efficiently and your skin looks great the more you use them.</li>
            <li> YAY so many and great price.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for this product in many places and was so happy I found it.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Was requested by my daughter and she was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I think the price is good, the results are amazing</li>
            <li> Amazon has the best price if you are able to take advantage of their free shipping offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very fast ship and a wonderful product!</li>

            <li> it does much more than just firms and rejuvenate your face!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> Just use it twice a week and your skin will feel so much better!</li>
            <li> Love these use and toss!</li>
            <li> I love these !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I purchased the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion System!</li>
            <li> The first time I tried the product, I was impressed with the after look.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite Microdermabrasion puffs!</li>
            <li> We Love it  !</li>
            <li> i love it!</li>
            <li> but i have found that one or two of those puffs to be more harsher and abrasive than the rest!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and very handy</li>
            <li> This device is a great alternative to paying huge prices at the spa</li>
            <li> but product amazing</li>
            <li> amazing results when using it with the Neutrogena microdermabrasion machine.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin look and feel amazing.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best thing a woman can do for her skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a hit and miss chance of finding them in stock in my area so the convenience of being able to order them on line is great, to be able to get them cheaper is defiantly a bonus.</li>
            <li> I guess each to their own</li>
            <li> so easy to use, clean perfect my oily sking</li>
            <li> I own the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion  System so I must have the refills.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a cost effective way to boost surface cell turnover for firmer, younger-looking skin.</li>
            <li> Really good product, my skin looks really better now than before</li>
            <li> Kind of spendy</li>
            <li> A nice replenshisment of the pads used with the device I saw on Dr. Oz&#x27;s program.  </li>
            <li> These are refills, so you need to get the contraption that goes with them, but the whole set up is awesome.</li>
            <li> i love this product i feel i am not getting &#x27;cheated&#x27;  for not spending boo coo bucks on the &#x27;good&#x27; stuff...</li>
            <li> Product came on time and was packaged nicely</li>
            <li> I think the product is good, but very strong, so I can&#x27;t use it more than x2</li>
            <li> one day I decided to check out Amazon , in a matter of minutes, I found exactly what I wanted and they work great and for a good price.</li>
            <li> Clean air helped as well as great spring water.</li>
            <li> Great product and not to much soap in the pads which is a really good thing.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re the sort of person who does a better job brushing their teeth when using an electric toothbrush -- the novelty of a gadget somehow makes you more invested -- this might be a good way for you to wash your face.</li>
            <li> the pads are excellent, after 1 use my skin felt smooth and fresh.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>

            <li> I love these pads.</li>
            <li> My skin is softer smoother and looks healthy.</li>
            <li> it means that my skin is producing so many cells that it cant shed them and therefore my pores get clogged.</li>
            <li> I am in love.</li>
            <li> I really love the results I&#x27;m getting from the microdermabrasion system, but</li>
            <li> I like being able to just toss the pads when you&#x27;re done using them.</li>
            <li> I ordered 24 more pads.</li>

            <li> LOVE this product though, and it is so inexpensive you CAN afford to pamper yourself with this product.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite beauty products.  </li>
            <li> but this product is great for the whole family.</li>

            <li> i am way more satified with this..</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)  </li>
            <li> They work great and offer a deeper treatment than my exfoliating crime (Queen Helene which is great, and much better than other OTC brands because it is more fine-grained).</li>
            <li> good price, right product and timely arrival.</li>
            <li> If these keep her looking beautiful and young, then I&#x27;m all in!</li>

            <li> This works fine for not being pricey.</li>
            <li> I liked the product it never fails to give my face a smooth glowing finish.</li>
            <li> Adhesive worked just fine for all 24 pads.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena made this little toy that is perfect to use on your skin  to help with complexion and smoothness of the surface.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for helping me prevent breakouts since I do wear light coverage foundation daily.</li>
            <li> The micro abrasion system exfoliates the skin, leaving it silky smooth.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so smooth and brighter.</li>

            <li> Really doing a nice job of cleaning my pores and making my skin look smoother...love it</li>
            <li> Prior to these, I used an apricot scrub which was great,</li>
            <li> Great results in a short period of time.</li>
            <li> They are a great daily cleaner for me (age 42).</li>
            <li> I have light acne breakouts which improved</li>
            <li> and I also refuse to spend $300 on a clarisonic, this always leaves my skin smooth and &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Exfoliates, makes skin smooth and it glows afterwards.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this product.  </li>
            <li> I am so happy to see these back on the market!!  </li>
            <li> But also, they lived in the country and grew their own veggies and ate really well...</li>
            <li> These are a great addition to my weekly facial skin care.  </li>
            <li> This product did smooth my skin</li>
            <li> The meds I use go on smoother and my skin looks and feels fabulous.</li>
            <li> This product makes your skin smooth and silky.</li>

            <li> enjoy the way</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone looking to smooth and brighten skin.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> I follow with vit E or light almond organic oil after useage.</li>
            <li> So my mom bought these for herself and its makes her skin so smooth</li>
            <li> It came with an extra head attachment which turned out to be awesome as my mom accidentally threw out the one the whole system can with</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen some of the benefits they say you can get at this point, but I am pleased with how smooth and fresh it makes my skin.  </li>
            <li> The pads work nicely in the comfort and convenience of your own home, saving a lot of money to the spa for a facial.  </li>
            <li> They lather up good and leave my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve found my skin stays pretty happy and beautiful lately because I do just one thing with consistency</li>
            <li> I tend to think my skin is fair and sometime sensitive.</li>
            <li> really makes my skin feel smooth and soft after a good treatment on the weekends!</li>
            <li> however 24 puffs and that price its very useful.</li>
            <li> find it very necessary and feels great and clean.</li>
            <li> The cream wasn&#x27;t heavy, it rinsed clean and after a treatment, my skin had a wonderful even texture and a glow.</li>
            <li> Skin feels great, and extra clean.</li>
            <li> These refills fit the original product well and does the job intended.  </li>
            <li> now maybe she can scrub her face and make it look fresh and clean again!</li>
            <li> , so I think I&#x27;m spending significantly longer cleaning my face with this than I would if I were just rubbing a face</li>
            <li> However, they are awesome on my neck, upper chest, and feet; also, I find these do not need to be tossed after each use (probably just the company&#x27;s way to sell you more stuff), and seem to last a while.  </li>
            <li> Left my skin radiant and healthy looking after first use!!!!  </li>
            <li> i use it about onces a week make my skin feel really clean</li>
            <li> The results are super smooth clean skin.  </li>
            <li> Leaves a nice soft and smooth feeling after drying.</li>
            <li> It rinses well and leaves me with a clean face.  </li>
            <li> I like to steam open my pores and use really warm water on the puff just to try to get the most out of this product.</li>
            <li> Great product, really gave my face a deep clean!</li>
            <li> I use these almost every other day to help exfoliate and it makes my skin beautiful.</li>
            <li> Received these right away - from across the country!</li>
            <li> Even at my most lazy I can spare 3 minutes to run this over my face and that&#x27;s a win.</li>
            <li> Good facial cleaning pads.</li>
            <li> I love this product my skin feels and looks so much smoother and softer.  </li>
            <li> I already have the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion system and I love that these refills aren&#x27;t very costly.</li>
            <li> Love the product, but it might be cheaper in a real store?</li>
            <li> Very reasonably priced and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Other than that, great product!Will order again..</li>
            <li> IT MADE MY FACE FEEL REALLY CLEAN AND FRESH</li>
            <li> It keeps my face clean and feeling fresh.....</li>
            <li> So since I already had the Neutogena handheld machine thing I thought I&#x27;d give the microdermabrasion pads a try for a quick fix.</li>
            <li> would recommend this product to anyone looking to add a mild dermabrasion product to their beauty regime.  </li>
            <li> so I go through puffs quickly.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take the place of a peofessIonal microdermabrasion treatment but is a nice substitution when you have no other options.</li>
            <li> These pads are the same kind as the ones that originally came with the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion system.</li>
            <li> To be fair, I did give the product a chance by using them every other day for 2 weeks just to see if it was the formula working to smooth out my skin and remove any impurities but the flakiness did not stop.</li>
            <li> Since I started using this product however, my face has produced and excreted more oil than normal.</li>
            <li> I was a loyal and delighted user of the original version of this product: an exfoliating cream used with a dense foam sponge head that fit the same machine as the new pads do</li>
            <li> I love how clean and soft my face feels.</li>
            <li> They clean your face very well and my face is silky smooth and works  </li>
            <li> Pleased that a new attachment was included with the Puff Refills</li>
            <li> I am 30 years old and have been using this system consistently for almost 2 months and my skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I am getting super-duper microderm abrasion, but it does a pretty good job and my face is not beet red, so that is a plus.  </li>
            <li> This refill pack last a long time and its an awesome value to buy this size.</li>
            <li> I recently started using this Neutrogena Microdermabrasion System and absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> The 24 count puff refill pack means I am not rushing back to the store for more quite as often!</li>
            <li> Definitely one of my favorite beauty products!</li>
            <li> This is a better deal than Walgreen&#x27;s has usually not the case.</li>
            <li> Really does help lessen fine lines.</li>
            <li> my skin tone is more even, and there is a definite decrease in fine lines.&lt;br</li>
            <li> works really well, not hard to use at all start seeing results with in two weeks and very fast and effective</li>
            <li> After use, my face feels super clean, smooth, and soft.</li>
            <li> They really seem to help smooth my skin without any discomfort or irritation.</li>
            <li> they smell good and have soap in them that works when you wet them.</li>
            <li> So simple and effective</li>
            <li> I get th perfect grade of exfoilant thats stronger than a regular scrub but gentle enough not to damage my skin.</li>
            <li> l love these thanks ; fast shipping</li>
            <li> i just bought 6 months worth of the the refills.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Buy the system, its totally worth every dime.</li>
            <li> I also used this product after returning from a tropical vacation - my skin was peeling a bit (too much fun in the sun), and this product cleaned, smoothed, and polished my skin to reveal a sunkissed glow.  </li>
            <li> smile lines are less noticeable and my skin looks remarkably</li>
            <li> My older skin needs more exfoliation than younger skin to keep it looking fresh and healthy.</li>
            <li> My skin works better with the orange Neutrogena Wave Deep Clean Exfoliating Pads</li>
            <li> Dr. Oz got this one right.  </li>
            <li> The soap embedded in the puff is just the right amount to cover my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> I had read about this system and was eager to buy it and start using it right away.  </li>

            <li> Simple, easy to use, it gets the job done!</li>
            <li> Great alternative to much more expensive machines and procedures.  </li>
            <li> It feels good on my face because its like a massage and helps less bumps on my face.</li>
            <li> Was thrilled to see that these pads fit, and tried them a few times.  </li>

            <li> I could tell a difference after the first use.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Neutrogena product since 2004 and it makes my face smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> I love the entire Neutrogena microdermabrasion system.  </li>
            <li> I have seen this product at a higher price at the pharmacies.</li>
            <li> Refills work well as usual, very happy with entire product.</li>
            <li> purchased these for my sister and from the first usage she noticed the immidiate changes.  </li>
            <li> because I am satisfied, I saw a difference on my face.people tell me I look younger.</li>
            <li> I felt a softer skin after the first use.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> and I tried it for the first time yesterday before I went to rehearsal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These pads leave my skin smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a bit of discomfort and heat sensation on first try but on my succeeding use I didn&#x27;t experience it anymore.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!  </li>
            <li> My skin looked clean, luminous and very soft.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think these pads have any magical chemicals in them that clean my face better or worse than bottled face cleansers.</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff I use, I use my hand to apply because I prefer more control and pressure that way, my face feels clean and soft...</li>
            <li> This product is used with a special hand held massager that you must purchase separately, as these are only the refill pads and not the full microdermabrasion system.</li>
            <li> This product makes your skin so clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> I too use 1/2 squirt of neutrogena face soap, \\&quot;after you use it the first time the soap is pretty much gone.</li>
            <li> My face since the first time you can really see the difference.</li>
            <li> a shame that in order to make a few extra bucks, Neutrogena ruined what had been one of the most effective skin care systems on the market.</li>
            <li> The puff refills are fine but you could easily skip buying the little machine.</li>
            <li> These are great and are hard to find!</li>
            <li> I run the puff (already applied to machine) under hot tap water before and during use so that the machine glides smoothly over my skin throughout the entire process.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you lotion up your face afterwards or it will dry up</li>
            <li> these aren&#x27;t so easy to find in stores anymore, so that is the only reason why it gets 4 stars.</li>
            <li> The novelty certainly works for me.</li>
            <li> New in Box and used it right away.</li>
            <li> I am honestly starting to feel that these reviews are overly positive and are hugely</li>
            <li> it cleans your skin very well and it helps you from breaking out</li>
            <li> Really makes a difference</li>
            <li> It is much smoother, softer and even-toned.</li>
            <li> thanks you.</li>
            <li> I use this about twice a month or when my face feels really grungy.  </li>
            <li> It exfoliates really well.</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really Amazon sold health and beauty items until recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All thanks to my microdermabrasion system and puffs.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> (you have to order the whole system again).</li>
            <li> I know that when I use it I SHOULD NOT APPLY TO MUCH PRESSURE.</li>
            <li> and it works very well.</li>
            <li> One of the issues is that the pad is VERY abrasive and TOO MUCH oil was removed with each use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see any difference yet</li>
            <li> Intense, Day Lotion, Day/Night Lotion and Eye Cream.  </li>
            <li> I want to say thank you because my skin has really changed and has lightened up and has brighten the</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not using and I really appreciate what you all did for me</li>
            <li> but the results are very noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pads really polish away imperfections</li>
            <li> but I really like the results of a smoother skin.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I prob use them too much</li>
            <li> I have really missed my face scrubby.  </li>
            <li> so haven&#x27;t seen to much</li>
            <li> Will absolutely order this product again when needed.</li>
            <li> Works even better than expected with Neutrogena&#x27;s Microdermabrasion System.</li>
            <li> This is one really works.</li>
            <li> The next day, my moisturizer and makeup glided on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> and I still HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li> they really work well with the microdermabrasion system.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena brand pads, the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> very nice.carefully package</li>
            <li> really works.</li>
            <li> My skin is much smoother after each use and the puffs are not too</li>
            <li> Fast shipment.</li>
            <li> I have been using these pads with the attachment for 5 yrs and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> You really feel as though you are getting a deep clean.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find the system to be something that I particularly give much value.  </li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old formula and sponge gave outstanding results, and the half-inch thick foam applicator made it easy to get into the contours of my face.  </li>
            <li> every other day I just put a new washing pad and my face feel clean and also my pores have gotten smaller, making my make up look much much better.</li>
            <li> so my skin stays pretty clear.</li>
            <li> Came early and is exactly as described</li>
            <li> You feel the smooth, fresh feeling instantly and for me that instant gratification is the draw</li>
            <li> I was glad to see a slightly reduced price on amazon.  </li>
            <li> The refill puffs have returned at a decent price of under EIGHTEEN BUCKS for two months of treatments.  </li>
            <li> Found these and based on some of the questions/reviews, decided to give it shot and &#x27;hoped&#x27; that it would work with my older unit.  </li>
            <li> I use each of the puffs twice - there is more than enough product on the puff to use a second time.  </li>
            <li> dead skin cells from my face leaving me with a good overall feeling.  </li>
            <li> The texture of my skin is smoother &amp; so very soft!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone wishing to improve and maintain their appearance.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this system.</li>
            <li> is that they were a little more exfoliating.</li>
            <li> and I did not mean to order two mini pad because I don&#x27;t want a lot of somethings around that</li>
            <li> Glad to see these little pads.</li>
            <li> I think you could take just the little circles of face sanding paper and do a better job than this vibrating handle.</li>
            <li> I have so much more confidence all thanks to this little guy!</li>
            <li> but it is so popular, its hard to find it on the shelf in my neighborhood.</li>
            <li> It was very nice that the lady on the other end of the phone believed me &amp; sent me another&lt;br /&gt;order to replace the missing one .</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll, the attachment snaps right onto my older unit and definitely cheaper to use than going to the spa or using the sponge pads.  </li>
            <li> But because there is no thick foam to cushion your face anymore, you can&#x27;t treat the creases around your nose, or your brow line without the edges of the disc scratching your skin.</li>
            <li> Nice way to know you are getting scrubbed; especially because I work outside gets just gritty at times</li>
            <li> Looks fresh and younger after each use.</li>
            <li> It does leave my face feeling fresh and I actually have gotten a couple of comments about my face looking brighter.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty much the same as directed</li>
            <li> I use St. Ives green tea exfoliant, so I thought this product would help do the job better.</li>
            <li> Love these especially for dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new on this product, I&#x27;ve discovered recently, and I feel I&#x27;m going to love it for a long time!</li>
            <li> But I got it right finally and used the rest correctly.</li>
            <li> Using the microderm system in combination with vitamin oil like almond oil or vitamin E, I find that the dark marks vanish very quickly.</li>
            <li> I must say again, I can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel brand new.</li>
            <li> I would buy a new one every time, but I don&#x27;t want to contribute to the landfill.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and in described new condition.</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to harsh scrubs, and I have re-purchased these scrubber refills a few times now.</li>
            <li> it helps me to remove dead skin and makes my face clean without any grease or oil upon it; I will definitely order some more in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you could get the same results for cheaper if you put the same amount of time into scrubbing using a decent facial scrub and a washcloth</li>
            <li> Now I am back to purchasing them from a local store since they are no longer available on Prime.  </li>
            <li> my dermatologist said this system could help with old acne scars- after 2 weeks of use, no results yet, but I&#x27;ll give it a few more months-</li>
            <li> Although my skin felt soft and more firm after each use.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive but the puffs do not irritate my skin at all</li>
            <li> When I do find it in a drug store or specialty department store, it is priced far too high.</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin feel very soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Whatever your skincare product, this removes old skin and prepares your skin to accept and absorb product!  </li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using this system for the past 3 months....</li>
            <li> These work better than the more expensive brands!</li>
            <li> This system is better than the more expensive ones!</li>
            <li> This takes care of the problem, and leaves me feeling sooo soft!</li>
            <li> Gentle enough but feels like it really does slough off the old skin.  </li>
            <li> Usually I&#x27;m not the type of person to write a review</li>
            <li> My skin is so much better when I use this vs when I&#x27;m lazy and don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I am a pretty big health nut and juice, take vitamins, workout, etc</li>
            <li> The new head fits the old handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that you can really feel and see the difference after few uses.</li>
            <li> I enjoy taking the time for a little mini face massage and cleansing.  </li>
            <li> Product is very good but the packing was bad.</li>
            <li> I really love the  product that you have online- for a little while I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere in my area and had to search for it elsewhere; finally, I found it on the Amazon website.</li>
            <li> As far as the system itself goes, I really notice a difference in my skin when I use this regularly.</li>
            <li> I bought this system to clear up my oily acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Would definately recomend this to anyone looking clear up their skin (after a breakout) and to lessen their oily skin.</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> but I only use them every 2-3 days and really noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> Since I started using this, my skin looks soft and youthful.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the old lady hands anymore.</li>
            <li> Pull those old Neutrogena Rejuventors and Microdermabrasion Systems off the shelf.</li>
            <li> and i have sensitive, oily acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Skin feels soft and renewed after use.</li>
            <li> I have had this for about 2 years now and it makes my face feel so soft</li>
            <li> I am 48 and people think I am in my early 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li> My skin has cleared up and it feels soft.</li>
            <li> Sensitive for your skin.</li>
            <li> However when I found it on Amazon, I was surprised.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since I was 19 yrs old</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> So far I like it.</li>
            <li> I think it looks a whole lot younger than it did</li>
            <li> This package of refills seems old or something.  </li>
            <li> No need for professional facials with this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am 55 and have the skin of a 30 year old.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the disc is dampened with water, it foams...and the user exfoliates her face using the machine as with the old method.  </li>
            <li> but my skin is just too sensitive for it.</li>
            <li> far I&#x27;ve been using it once a week</li>
            <li> After use, my skin feels so soft and I am gradually noticing that my skin looks healthier.  </li>
            <li> or if it&#x27;s sensitive.</li>
            <li> Wow, I have tried every product on the market and never had results like this.</li>
            <li> I bought the original Neutrogena kit some years ago and felt that the brush was a little too gentle on my oily, coarse skin.  </li>
            <li> After 4 weeks of use of the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion system with these pads, my skin is smoother and my dark areas are fading (I also use Ambi Fade Cream which is also by Johnson and Johnson, but the microdermabrasion seems to be speeding up the process because it never worked this quickly before).  </li>
            <li> I should say that my skin is not super, super sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and seriously recommend it...  </li>
            <li> I apply a hot wash cloth to my face prior to treatment to open pores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a typical acne sufferer either.</li>
            <li> also moist spot in the middle, is that normal??</li>
            <li> Takes a little bit for the cleanser to come out but don&#x27;t feel as though it is a quick treatment anyway.  </li>
            <li> I do make sure I am careful&amp; lift up a little 4 A smoother glide with no pull.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a very harsh old-lady perfume, or the smell of cheap hairspray or laundry soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually have enough of the product still on the pad when I use it the 2nd time, but by the 3rd or 4th time I put my own cleanser on the pad and then use it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After rinsing, I just couldn&#x27;t get the oily feel of the new product off my face; it is NOT the same cream as before, except for the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I have used scrubbing cloths that, for me, seem to work better with less fuss and mess.</li>
            <li> I have always had fairly good skin, but at 71 it seemed to look a little dry and the texture was a little different on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> morning, I noticed that my sun spots/freckles on my face are half missing or have lightened up by more than 50%... and my 2 sun spots on my left hand have been erased completely!</li>
            <li> They seem much rougher on my skin than usual and they don&#x27;t seem to have much cleanser in them.  </li>
            <li> And, if any of the plastic textured area becomes exposed, it&#x27;s like scrubbing your face with a cheese grater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the treatment for the same number of minutes as the old formula, and ended up breaking capillaries around my nose and on my checks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this product is too abrasive to use on the regular basis if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Then when I did they were kind of expensive.</li>
            <li> The product is great but these pads seemed to be a little dried out when opened and do not foam up like the past boxes I have bought in stores.</li>
            <li> A little pricey to use on a regular basis, but worth it.</li>
            <li> And a little acne, too, which at my age proves to me that exfoliation and increased blood flow is definitely happening.</li>
            <li> If you cannot handle any roughness against your skin, then you may have a different experience -- better or worse than I.</li>
            <li> It is a bit harsh and abrasive on older, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The first several I put on the applicator upside down as the gritty side is very coarse.</li>
            <li> I only use it every other sunday because I exfoliate daily, but I really like the product.</li>
            <li> , Neutrogena usually get it right when it comes to skincare.  </li>
            <li> My feeling was that instead of doing agreat job of exfoliating and leaving a natural glow like the old cream did, this new system did a half-assed job of exfoliating and just left an oil slick behind to fool the eye that my face was smooth.  </li>
            <li> I think that the refills should be less expensive considering that the whole kit is only about 3-5 dollars more.</li>
            <li> I like this product because after I used it with the little device you put it on it made my face feel really soft.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> I found that using it three times a week for me is a little too much.</li>
            <li> I have recently had some acne issues with some hormonal changing due to breastfeeding and this system is the only thing that has helped clear my skin up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like that system but to see results, you have to use it frequently as recommended by the manufacturer and not only once every other week.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the scrubber surface scrubs any better or worse than other face scrub products.</li>
            <li> My first treatment was the most dramatic because my wrinkles were less noticeable after all of the dead skin was buffed away.</li>
            <li> Although I like this product, and am pretty sure that I noticed a difference in my skin (feeling softer and less bumpy) within a week, the refills (in stores) are expensive!  </li>
            <li> I live for professional microdermabrasion treatments but recently moved to a remote location where these kinds of treatments are not available.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used my Microdermabrasion system long enough to know if adhesive will last thru 20 pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (there&#x27;s no active ingredients listed, but I imagine Neutrogena probably makes a facewash with similar ingredients, not to mention any number of other quality brands).</li>
            <li> These refills are hard to find in stores, so thanks, Amazon.com!  </li>
            <li> Then I briefly scrub my chest and my shoulders, where I sometimes have some minor breakouts.</li>
            <li> some reason--maybe customers were making the cream and foam attachments last too long</li>
            <li> Use Cetaphil oil control lotion only as needed on dry areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find it for less at Target, though.</li>
            <li> but I still have the same dry spots on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Though these are supposed to be single use puffs, I find I can use each several times before replacing.</li>
            <li> My skin is not very sensitive, but this hurt.  </li>
            <li> and my skin goes back to being an absolute dry and dull nightmare.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a perfect product for removing all age spots and other skin discoloration and wrinkles, but will surely lightened them all up.</li>
            <li> If you have bad acne scars then this is exactly what you need in your life!!!!</li>
            <li> the new method, the thin discs stay on it with a new snap-on head textured with a rough plastic surface that essentially meshes like Velcro with the felt-like layer on underside of the discs.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working well everywhere, although I notice that the small spaces that the scrubber is too wide to get to (the bridge of my nose, in particular) are starting to breakout because they&#x27;re not getting cleaned unless I re-wash my face with something else.</li>
            <li> If you use this on a WET face there may be enough moisture in the puff.</li>
            <li> This is something that I will use LONG TERM not just once or twice</li>
            <li> my face feels smoother and smoother, as long as they keep making this</li>
            <li> Not to harsh on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> A lot cheaper than actual microdermabrasion though this is not really like the one you get at an aesthetician&#x27;s office...</li>
            <li> I will continue to use them for as long as I can get them and recommend them enthusiastically.</li>
            <li> I have never ordered anything on line &amp; when it took so long for my order</li>
            <li> Two settings on the system, slow and fast.</li>
            <li> though I did bring cognac colored purses back in style for this summer since I&#x27;ve been carrying mine for the last year and a half...</li>
            <li> this is my secret, pure and simple</li>
            <li> Bottles, box and bag were busted open due to shipment..</li>
            <li> My face got really dry and even after putting on moisturizer, I still had flaky spots.</li>
            <li> I have uber dry, flaky skin.</li>
            <li> It is either oily or dry and I tend to be dry around my mouth because of the face wash that I use.  </li>
            <li> Currently wash face with 4% panoxyl once a day followed by thin application of Atralin (gentle formulation rx tretinoin).</li>
            <li> Do not use on active acne though as it may irritate the skin further.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m down to my last three out of a pack of 12.</li>
            <li> We like this product but unfortunately the box was only half full.</li>
            <li> Because of the regular exfoliation, I feel my skin has also become less prone to break outs.</li>
            <li> The only problem is, a box of the pads are a little pricey at Target</li>
            <li> Only problem is they are hard to find enough to order.  </li>
            <li> Came on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> Has to be careful with packing.</li>
            <li> Follow directions carefully, don&#x27;t get over zealous and</li>
            <li> delivered as expected, will have to wait to see if product does as expected...</li>
            <li> I thought these might be rough on my face, but they aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Some of you know how those 2 spots have been bugging me these last few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I finally phoned your&lt;br /&gt;company &amp; reported that it was missing .</li>
            <li> This is a TREATMENT not a daily cleansing system so this product can not accurately be compared to the Clarisonic/Olay/Dove cleansing systems.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m certainly not a Fashionista...</li>
            <li> I found other You Tube reviews helpful but be careful when following the advice of others because some of them did not follow directions and ended up with red, inflamed skin after pressing down too hard.</li>
            <li> our beauty regimen and skin is improved at a reasonable price compared to the past year&#x27;s highway robbery pricing on the secondary market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I feel like such a fool buying this system, don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I just got the scrubber the other day and cant wait to use it again.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says it does on the package, so you cannot go wrong if you follow the directions.</li>
            <li> anything i tries it really cleans the pores with or with out makeup on and getts allthe dirty out and makes the pores smaller</li>
            <li> I use it every other night.  </li>
            <li> and then it goes beyond that and lasts extremely well for a couple days.</li>
            <li> Other people have even commented on it.</li>
            <li> go out, my skin is a little red for a few hours afterwards but no discomfort at all.</li>
            <li> Can hardly wait till I&#x27;ve been using it a bit longer to see if all the improvements to my face actually take place.</li>
            <li> At this point, however,  I have taken to using the same pad at least 3-4 times.  </li>
            <li> The non-Prime options make the price not worth ordering online.  </li>
            <li> But heaven help you if you&#x27;re using it on your forehead and it drips down into your eyes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t push down on it while doing.</li>
            <li> one has to keep shopping around or waiting as price goes up and down</li>
            <li> I use a cream foundation and I use a lot less on my skin after using this product, so I save money on cosmetics too.</li>
            <li> wrinkles are less noticable</li>
            <li> Not too expensive relative to similar products, too</li>
            <li> No good as i think it&#x27;s should be, I can not note the different at all after using for a month</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine what these pads would do to someone with delicate, dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It dries up my skin just a little bit</li>
            <li> I order these and found that they were the ones for my little machine.</li>
            <li> it was a little wrinkley .</li>
            <li> small disappointment was receiving only 1 attachment head for 2 containers of the pads, but I see that was clearly stated;</li>
            <li> /&gt;it is a little harsh</li>
            <li> Makes my face smoth and after a few times I have seen reduced blemishes on my face.</li>
            <li> but really messy</li>
            <li> I also run the pad under water a few times while doing the process &amp; keep my face splashed with water.</li>
            <li> Included are two packs of pads and the round plastic piece that snaps onto the vibrator.  </li>
            <li> but I am not used it so everyday because I am in the sun each morning</li>
            <li> i bought the kit a few weeks ago thinking that for the price i wouldn&#x27;t me upset if it didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Now I have a few months supply</li>
            <li> have used this product and found it to be extremely abrasive and left my skin red and almost painful after one attempt (this never happens usually).</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the past few years and like the results including the way my skin feels and looks afterward.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for an alternative to the expensive visits to the salon!</li>
            <li> As I said in my review of the Vibrator, these tubes of blue dots are worthless to me and will go into a drawer with old cosmetics.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what the shelf life is</li>
            <li> This machine VIBRATES because the puffs contain crystals that can be too harsh if used with a circulating machine!</li>
            <li> and it was starting to get expensive on replacing the pads.  </li>
            <li> I use these every 3 weeks to get rid of the dead skin and my skin glows!</li>
            <li> I am not sure what the problem is</li>
            <li> I takes off the dead skin!</li>
            <li> I buy a lot of skincare products as have had problems in the past.</li>
            <li> I like it, but not  sure it is making any improvements in my skin.</li>
            <li> so I would recommend not more than 4 times a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s whats causing it to break out more,,,or if it&#x27;s the cleansing process of this product?</li>
            <li> I was a bit dubious about the raves, but in the few weeks I&#x27;ve used this the improvement is quite noticeable!</li>
            <li> Hard to find...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a VIBRATOR and vibrates so hard it makes my ears itch.  </li>
            <li> I go a week without using this my face feels  and looks dull.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to find them in stores</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to use just anything, but I never breakout or get any redness with this product.  </li>
            <li> I use 2-3 times a week, &amp; don&#x27;t press hard; no need to over-do the abrasion.</li>
            <li> i was having a hard time finding refills in store</li>
            <li> Package was a little broken state when it was delivered.</li>
            <li> --Neutrogena stopped manufacturing the cream and foam pad attachment, and replaced them with thin discs containing a one-time use dose of exfoliant, activated with a little water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was really late when it finally showed up &amp; I was afraid this order was going to go misssing as</li>
            <li> I have acne scars that have been slowly fading with this.</li>
            <li> I love this microdermabrasion system and was so disappointed when the puffs became impossible to find anywhere.  </li>
            <li> I mean doing the microdermabrasion as advertised.</li>
            <li> This product is expensive, but a lot less when purchased from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> There probably isn&#x27;t anything at all wrong with the product/system...just too harsh for my skin.</li>
            <li> It came with an attachment that fits on the old base with some Velcro and the pads attach to it.</li>
            <li> The puff is probably a bit too abrasive to use on broken skin.  </li>
            <li> Cost is expensive &amp; it is way over rated.</li>
            <li> I have weird skin.  </li>
            <li> DONT GET ME WRONG.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately now I an no to trusting ordering things on line .</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> It hurts like crazy even if you flush it a million times.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment not to find them.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I was still out there looking for a replacement and happened across the refills!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this system for a couple of years and as those of you who have been using it know, there was a period of time where the refills were very expensive, then almost impossible to find.</li>
            <li> I have even wondered it they might be counterfeit because I have never had the quality of a Neutrogena product be bad.</li>
            <li> Too bad I have to smell so bad after using it.</li>
            <li> I have never seen my face break out this bad.</li>
            <li> It gave me bad acne.</li>
            <li> oh, how I hate the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> But, keep the lather out of your eyes as it will sting very bad!!!!  </li>
            <li> Also, it tastes terrible.  </li>
            <li> The pads prices are outrageous.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good facial cleaning pads.</li>
            <li> Great alternative to much more expensive machines and procedures.  Leaves skin more smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li> it cleans your skin very well and it helps you from breaking out</li>
            <li> I have acne marks and I use it for that purpose and I saw improvement over time with  continual use. But heaven help you if you&#x27;re using it on your forehead and it drips down into your eyes. It hurts like crazy even if you flush it a million times.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. A little pricey to use on a regular basis, but worth it. The micro abrasion system exfoliates the skin, leaving it silky smooth. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Really makes a difference</li>
            <li> The refills are exactly like the ones in the store, but cheaper.  Came as two containers of refills just like the ones that came with the machine.</li>
            <li> My daughter purchased this for me and I love it! Ordered the refills because I want to keep using it. It makes my skin so smooth and brighter. Very reasonably priced and easy to use. would de recommend.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LOVE THIS PRODUCT, WHEN I USED IT ON MY FACE WOW IT MADE MY FACE FEEL REALLY CLEAN AND FRESH,  THANK YOU FOR YOUR GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE AND YOUR QUICK SHIPPING!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Neutrogena system and the refills so I wouldn&#x27;t run out.  Great product and not to much soap in the pads which is a really good thing.</li>
            <li> Very fast ship and a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Left my skin radiant and healthy looking after first use!!!!  Fits perfectly with the Neutrogena Sonic Wave, Excellent Combo!!!&lt;br /&gt;I love Neutrogena!!1</li>
            <li> Doe a great job and I really love the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion system. Simple, easy to use, it gets the job done!</li>
            <li> Yay!  After almost a year of skulking through e-bay and paying triple price, these beauties are back!  This is the absolute best thing a woman can do for her skin.  Whatever your skincare product, this removes old skin and prepares your skin to accept and absorb product!  I use an alpha hydroxy in the am, and an over the counter retinol at night.  I am 57 and people always ask me my skin care regime... this is it folks, try it!</li>
            <li> I was glad to find the refills on Amazon and about $3.00 cheaper than my local Wal-Marts. It&#x27;s a hit and miss chance of finding them in stock in my area so the convenience of being able to order them on line is great, to be able to get them cheaper is defiantly a bonus.</li>
            <li> I recently started using this Neutrogena Microdermabrasion System and absolutely love this product! The refill puffs are sturdy and stay in place when used on the Neutrogena apparatus. They exfoliate your skin efficiently and your skin looks great the more you use them. My skin is very sensitive but the puffs do not irritate my skin at all but I only use them every 2-3 days and really noticed a difference. I would recommend this product to women and men that want there skin to look radiant and healthy. These puffs are a &#x27;must have&#x27; for me.</li>
            <li> Awesome product &amp; seller.  Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Came on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> Product is very good but the packing was bad.Package was a little broken state when it was delivered.Has to be careful with packing.Rest all good.</li>
            <li> Since I started using this, my skin looks soft and youthful.  People have noticed the change and asked me what I&#x27;m using and give me this incredulous when I tell them is just neutrogena.</li>
            <li> My only fear is that this might be discontinued in the future.  Great product.  Loves how it makes my complexion feel.  Use it also on the back of my hands.  I don&#x27;t have the old lady hands anymore.</li>
            <li> why did u stop selling it? is it being discontinued? is ther anyone who is still selling it?  . I love it wish u didn&#x27;t stop selling it. where can I order more and when?</li>
            <li> I like that system but to see results, you have to use it frequently as recommended by the manufacturer and not only once every other week.</li>
            <li> Loves these puff pads, great refill for my neutragena facial cleaner</li>
            <li> Neutrogena&#x27;s Microdermabrasion System is an excellent way to combat the signs of aging.  The 24 count puff refill pack means I am not rushing back to the store for more quite as often!</li>
            <li> Pull those old Neutrogena Rejuventors and Microdermabrasion Systems off the shelf. The refill puffs have returned at a decent price of under EIGHTEEN BUCKS for two months of treatments.  Yes, they&#x27;re good, they&#x27;re very good. Follow directions carefully, don&#x27;t get over zealous and our beauty regimen and skin is improved at a reasonable price compared to the past year&#x27;s highway robbery pricing on the secondary market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to look for the available buying options and prices including Amazon Subscribe and Save :)</li>
            <li> I like these pads, the only thing i wish was different is that they were a little more exfoliating. Other than that i like them they smell good and have soap in them that works when you wet them. Did not make me break out of anything of that sort and i have sensitive, oily acne prone skin. Would recommend as a good cleanser.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Makes my face smoth and after a few times I have seen reduced blemishes on my face.</li>
            <li> This kit is fantastic forn the at home microderm abrasion results. It is not a treatment in an office as a medical procedure but works well for turning over your skin layers and improving your skin softness and look</li>
            <li> Definitely can see and feel a difference in the smoothness of my skin after using this. So simple and effective</li>
            <li> A great product.  But, keep the lather out of your eyes as it will sting very bad!!!!  Also, it tastes terrible.  But the product works well.</li>
            <li> Really doing a nice job of cleaning my pores and making my skin look smoother...love it</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using this system for the past 3 months....really makes my skin feel smooth and soft after a good treatment on the weekends! I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for an alternative to the expensive visits to the salon!</li>
            <li> These pads are really great for exfoliating your face! Prior to these, I used an apricot scrub which was great, but really messy and I always wound up with the exfoliate grains in my eyes. With these pads, I can just stick one on and quickly scrub my face in or out of the shower, no mess, nothing in my eyes, and my face always feels so smooth afterwards. Definitely one of my favorite beauty products!</li>
            <li> I gave this five stars because after three uses I see an obvious improvement in my skin. And a little acne, too, which at my age proves to me that exfoliation and increased blood flow is definitely happening. I live for professional microdermabrasion treatments but recently moved to a remote location where these kinds of treatments are not available. I looked into getting a microdermabrasion machine for home use but I don&#x27;t trust myself to understand how to properly use it. So since I already had the Neutogena handheld machine thing I thought I&#x27;d give the microdermabrasion pads a try for a quick fix. They work great and offer a deeper treatment than my exfoliating crime (Queen Helene which is great, and much better than other OTC brands because it is more fine-grained). So for the price and convenience of this product I give it five stars. It doesn&#x27;t take the place of a peofessIonal microdermabrasion treatment but is a nice substitution when you have no other options.</li>
            <li> delivered as expected, will have to wait to see if product does as expected...</li>
            <li> have been using these for over a year love them</li>
            <li> I use this maybe once or twice a week. It&#x27;s great for helping me prevent breakouts since I do wear light coverage foundation daily. I have sensitive skin, so normal face scrub usually takes my skin off or makes it red for hours. This is a great alternative to harsh scrubs, and I have re-purchased these scrubber refills a few times now.</li>
            <li> It came with an extra head attachment which turned out to be awesome as my mom accidentally threw out the one the whole system can with</li>
            <li> Love my microdermabrasion set and these refills make it easy to keep using it. Easy order and receipt of product. Don&#x27;t have to go searching for it in stores.</li>
            <li> Hard to find...these work well for me</li>
            <li> I purchased TWO tubes of these things.  Perhaps if I could stick them on my Clarisonic brushes so that they would MOVE  around I would use them.  I purchased the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion System which, in my opinion, is a JOKE.  It&#x27;s a VIBRATOR and vibrates so hard it makes my ears itch.  As I said in my review of the Vibrator, these tubes of blue dots are worthless to me and will go into a drawer with old cosmetics.  I feel like such a fool buying this system, don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Love these especially for dry winter skin. Skin feels soft and renewed after use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this system for a couple of years and as those of you who have been using it know, there was a period of time where the refills were very expensive, then almost impossible to find. Now on S&amp;S through Amazon, they&#x27;re cheaper than ever.   As far as the system itself goes, I really notice a difference in my skin when I use this regularly. It is much smoother, softer and even-toned.</li>
            <li> This is my second refill and I really love this product, Neutrogena usually get it right when it comes to skincare.  I get th perfect grade of exfoilant thats stronger than a regular scrub but gentle enough not to damage my skin. Be sure to start off only 1x a week to allow your skin to adjust then increase to 2x.  Follow instructions in packaging.</li>
            <li> I have used this scrub for yr.s.I haven&#x27;t noticed many more wrinkles.My face glows after use.I use once a week.I also run the pad under water a few times while doing the process &amp; keep my face splashed with water.I don&#x27;t push down on it while doing. I do use under my eye&#x27;s with no problem.I do make sure I am careful&amp; lift up a little 4 A smoother glide with no pull.I guess each to their own but I recommend !!!</li>
            <li> Great! Luminous change after the first use, soft and smooth skin. Great for massage.</li>
            <li> I have never owned the Neutrogena system itself but I bought these after hearing how wonderful they were and I do love them.  I just use them with my fingers and they do wonders for your skin.</li>
            <li> I love those puff, I have been used for quite bit time.</li>
            <li> l love these thanks ; fast shipping</li>
            <li> I love this microdermabrasion system and was so disappointed when the puffs became impossible to find anywhere.  These work great, are convenient and are the best price I&#x27;ve found anywhere.</li>
            <li> Ok, Im a dude and these are great! I just got the scrubber the other day and cant wait to use it again. I could tell a difference after the first use. I will continue to use. A+</li>
            <li> I love this product.  These microdermabrasion puffs are better and cheaper than a facial.  It is a buy again product for me.</li>
            <li> The Neutrogena healthy skin rejuvenator is a great product!! It is like a facial at home. I have had this for about 2 years now and it makes my face feel so soft and I have seen a great reduction in pore size and skin tone eveness. I am 48 and people think I am in my early 30&#x27;s and I&#x27;ll take that any day. I also get asked about my skin regimin a lot and of course I mention this as part of it. For awhile there I panicked!!! I could not find the puff refills any where. Then when I did they were kind of expensive. Thank goodness I found them and at a great price too!! I thank you and my face thanks you. Please don&#x27;t every go out of stock of these!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while and I just love it. My skin is clean and very smooth.</li>
            <li> I use this about twice a month or when my face feels really grungy.  After use, my face feels super clean, smooth, and soft.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena made this little toy that is perfect to use on your skin  to help with complexion and smoothness of the surface. My mother loves this</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed the Neutrogena system.  My skin has cleared up and it feels soft. I also don/t have the pimples anymore. It is great for my skin and I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> so easy to use, clean perfect my oily sking... perfect!</li>
            <li> I own the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion  System so I must have the refills.  The price is comparable to the local store and I have the added benefit of them being delivered to my door.  I love the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion  System..</li>
            <li> I ordered this product referred to me by a good friend.  I have been using the refills and my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> Used to get these as Drugstore.com, but now get as an add on.</li>
            <li> I agree with the person who said it&#x27;s a hyped up product. The first time I used it my face felt smoother....but its temporary &amp; does nothing else. The refill puffs are way over priced. My review is....it&#x27;s not so much....been using it several months...no big deal. Cost is expensive &amp; it is way over rated.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I am getting super-duper microderm abrasion, but it does a pretty good job and my face is not beet red, so that is a plus.  It exfoliates well.  I should say that my skin is not super, super sensitive.  If you cannot handle any roughness against your skin, then you may have a different experience -- better or worse than I.</li>
            <li> LOVED THE SYSTEM . TO WORK ....you HAVE to use it.  But it does help. Will it work like a $300 job? NO , but it works enough for my face and my budget. WE compromise a lot.</li>
            <li> Love these.  Great results in a short period of time.</li>
            <li> Love these. They really seem to help smooth my skin without any discomfort or irritation. This is a good price for a nice large package.</li>
            <li> Dr. Oz got this one right.  It is a very easy product to use and allows application of the moisturizer without getting your palms and fingers all greasy!</li>
            <li> These are great and are hard to find!</li>
            <li> i use it about onces a week make my skin feel really clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;make my skin feel really nice and clean</li>
            <li> The product is great but these pads seemed to be a little dried out when opened and do not foam up like the past boxes I have bought in stores. Not sure what the shelf life is but I will buy them in the store next time instead of order on line</li>
            <li> I use my neutrogena scrubber almost every day. I actually use the disks two or three times before I replace them, even though it says to use each once. I thought these might be rough on my face, but they aren&#x27;t. They are a great daily cleaner for me (age 42).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last 4 months and love the way my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really good, but it comes out a bit too pricey since you do have to replace them after each use, so I docked a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greetings from beautiful Armenia. :)</li>
            <li> i can see a difference in just couple weeks.  i use the product once a week, but it recommends more uses per week, but i dont want to be too aggressive with my skin.  but i am starting to see a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena products for years and have liked most of them, but this one is the very best.  The results are super smooth clean skin.  I use it prior to night time creams and a mask.  I hope they never stop making this system.  The results are terrific - even enlarged pores look smaller.  Pleasant to use and you toss the pad afterwards so no concern about gunky brushes or bacteria.  I love Olay products too, but Neutrogena has them beat with this one.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the past few years and like the results including the way my skin feels and looks afterward.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for my face and very easy to used it. I bought for stock beacause i like it more</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think these pads have any magical chemicals in them that clean my face better or worse than bottled face cleansers. I don&#x27;t think the scrubber surface scrubs any better or worse than other face scrub products. But somehow the ritual of using these pads is working out wonderfully, and my skin looks better than it has in ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to use the device for 1-2 minutes per area (what is an area, though? is my face one area? is each part of my face a separate area?), so I think I&#x27;m spending significantly longer cleaning my face with this than I would if I were just rubbing a face scrub gel on with my fingers -- and that&#x27;s probably the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this in the shower, and I scrub first my forehead and then the rest of my face. Then I briefly scrub my chest and my shoulders, where I sometimes have some minor breakouts. It seems to be working well everywhere, although I notice that the small spaces that the scrubber is too wide to get to (the bridge of my nose, in particular) are starting to breakout because they&#x27;re not getting cleaned unless I re-wash my face with something else. Maybe at the end of my routine, I should peel the pad off the device and scrub those spots by hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there&#x27;s nothing magical about this device or these pads. I&#x27;m sure you could get the same results for cheaper if you put the same amount of time into scrubbing using a decent facial scrub and a washcloth (there&#x27;s no active ingredients listed, but I imagine Neutrogena probably makes a facewash with similar ingredients, not to mention any number of other quality brands). But if you&#x27;re the sort of person who does a better job brushing their teeth when using an electric toothbrush -- the novelty of a gadget somehow makes you more invested -- this might be a good way for you to wash your face. The novelty certainly works for me.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, and good packaging for shipping.  Cleans my face without drying it out, and smell pretty good too.  Like others, I can get 2 uses out of each puff.</li>
            <li> Good product. Sensitive for your skin. My face since the first time you can really see the difference. Now is being 3 weeks my face looks wonderful</li>
            <li> Included are two packs of pads and the round plastic piece that snaps onto the vibrator.  These pads are the same kind as the ones that originally came with the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion system.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent microdermabrasion system. It exfoliates really well. These puffs are among the best on the market and they deliver results comparable to pricer brands.</li>
            <li> This is a better deal than Walgreen&#x27;s has usually not the case. It is a good product if you have RA like me and weakness in the hands at times. Nice way to know you are getting scrubbed; especially because I work outside gets just gritty at times</li>
            <li> I use these puffs twice a week. My face feels so much softer after sloughing off the dead skin, and I have also noticed an improvement with blackheads on my chin. Because of the regular exfoliation, I feel my skin has also become less prone to break outs.</li>
            <li> Love Neutrogena product. The Microdermabraion system is gentle on the skin and leaves your face feeling fresh and renewed. Give it a try you will love the effects.</li>
            <li> The puffs are excellent I recommend this they have enough cleaner on the them..They just velcro to the head of the machine..</li>
            <li> This is a TREATMENT not a daily cleansing system so this product can not accurately be compared to the Clarisonic/Olay/Dove cleansing systems. This machine VIBRATES because the puffs contain crystals that can be too harsh if used with a circulating machine! The puffs contain the same microdermabrasion crystals that are used by professionals. Amazon has the best price if you are able to take advantage of their free shipping offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this microdermabrasion treatment. It sloughs off dead skin and my complexion looks so much healthier. The texture of my skin is smoother &amp; so very soft! I use this system twice weekly but Neutrogena recommends using it up to 3x weekly MAX! I apply a hot wash cloth to my face prior to treatment to open pores. I run the puff (already applied to machine) under hot tap water before and during use so that the machine glides smoothly over my skin throughout the entire process. If you use this on a WET face there may be enough moisture in the puff. Be sure to use the FULL specified time on EACH area WITHOUT APPLYING PRESSURE! My first treatment was the most dramatic because my wrinkles were less noticeable after all of the dead skin was buffed away. I apply 100% Aloe after each treatment. I have light acne breakouts which improved but I still have to use my store brand Sulfur Mask as an overnight spot treatment on occasion so this treatment is not an \\&quot;acne miracle\\&quot; for HORMONAL breakouts but with continued use it will keep pores unclogged and improve the appearance of acne scars. This is something that I will use LONG TERM not just once or twice so keep this in mind &amp; be patient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend watching the \\&quot;NEUTROGENA\\&quot; Microdermabrasion System tutorial on their website. It&#x27;s also on You Tube. I found other You Tube reviews helpful but be careful when following the advice of others because some of them did not follow directions and ended up with red, inflamed skin after pressing down too hard. You should not be in pain after using this product so if you are, back off on the amount of pressure you apply during treatment. This machine is very easy to use and the instructions are simple. You should NOT have a problem with the puff staying on the machine so if you do exchange the product for another one or contact the manufacturer.ter using this product so if you are, back off on the amount of pressure you apply during treatment.

            <li> These refills are hard to find in stores, so thanks, Amazon.com!  My wife swears by the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion System.  If these keep her looking beautiful and young, then I&#x27;m all in!</li>
            <li> I’ve been using these for years. a staple of my weekly facial routine.</li>
            <li> I used puff refill for my mircroderm 2-3 times a week at night, some weeks are more. It feels good on my face because its like a massage and helps less bumps on my face. It dries up my skin just a little bit but I use a good night cream so it moistuerizes it.</li>
            <li> Great product, really gave my face a deep clean!</li>
            <li> These work better than the more expensive brands!</li>
            <li> Aside from using this on my face as in the instructions, I get to use this on my arms and elbows too.  There&#x27;s enough of the soapy thing to go around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus it smells really good.  Leaves a nice soft and smooth feeling after drying.</li>
            <li> I love these refills.  Brought them to go along with the machine.  They feel very good when cleansing the face.</li>
            <li> I really like this product but it is so popular, its hard to find it on the shelf in my neighborhood. When I do find it in a drug store or specialty department store, it is priced far too high. However when I found it on Amazon, I was surprised. I didn&#x27;t really Amazon sold health and beauty items until recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone looking to add a mild dermabrasion product to their beauty regime.  This product does exactly what it says it does on the package, so you cannot go wrong if you follow the directions. This product is used with a special hand held massager that you must purchase separately, as these are only the refill pads and not the full microdermabrasion system. It leaves the skin smooth and soft. Its so good, I use it twice a week, however the mfr recommends three times a week. I think it depends on your skin type and complexion issues. I use a cream foundation and I use a lot less on my skin after using this product, so I save money on cosmetics too.</li>
            <li> I had a Neutrogena Micro unit that I purchased more than 12 years ago.  I stopped using it because I felt that the sponge pads collected bacteria and it was starting to get expensive on replacing the pads.  Still kept the unit and started again into a &#x27;cheaper&#x27; beauty regimen.  The pads prices are outrageous.  Found these and based on some of the questions/reviews, decided to give it shot and &#x27;hoped&#x27; that it would work with my older unit.  We&#x27;ll, the attachment snaps right onto my older unit and definitely cheaper to use than going to the spa or using the sponge pads.  Thank you Neutrogena for not changing the design of the attachment.  Definitely liking your products again!</li>
            <li> I like the way these make my skin feel, but I prefer using them without the applicators, which may defeat the purpose. I&#x27;m sure there are scrubbing pads out there that do the same thing at a lower cost.</li>
            <li> this is a very good product. You really feel as though you are getting a deep clean. It leaves my skin feeling very smooth after use. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping that it will help with my scars from blackheads and the oil build up on my face! it works really well! i just bought 6 months worth of the the refills. Also it helps with some heat bumps i have been getting on my face! it does much more than just firms and rejuvenate your face! Worth every penny</li>
            <li> YAY so many and great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years now. I don&#x27;t get pimples often, but when I do I pop them, which tends to leave marks on my skin. Using the microderm system in combination with vitamin oil like almond oil or vitamin E, I find that the dark marks vanish very quickly. Plus it just makes my skin look youthful and rejuvenated. I must say again, I can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product it leaves your skin very smooth</li>
            <li> I order these and found that they were the ones for my little machine. I was able to use them anyway and they worked fine.</li>
            <li> My skin looks great! I use these every 3 weeks to get rid of the dead skin and my skin glows!</li>
            <li> I love it makes my skin look bright and feel soft . 😄</li>
            <li> I love this! every other day I just put a new washing pad and my face feel clean and also my pores have gotten smaller, making my make up look much much better. Just make sure you lotion up your face afterwards or it will dry up fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have this product on auto re ordering its that good.</li>
            <li> my skin and these puffs did not mesh well, also moist spot in the middle, is that normal??</li>
            <li> I had been looking for this product in many places and was so happy I found it. It works great</li>
            <li> good price, right product and timely arrival. This device is a great alternative to paying huge prices at the spa</li>
            <li> I odered neutrogena puff refills from Amazon. I received my order before promised time n i need not to go to parlour on the regular basis. I use my microderma brasion system with refill every third day n keep getting compliments from colleauges tht i glow a lot. I have started looking more beatiful n my confidecence has raised a lot. All thanks to my microdermabrasion system and puffs.</li>
            <li> I use this every day on my face.  Does not irritate me skin like some of the microdermabrasion products.  Thanks</li>
            <li> These work exactly as intended.  I do use mine 2 or 3 times before tossing.  Reminder to take off the just the puff and not the head attachment!  I accidentally threw mine away and they don&#x27;t sell replacements, (you have to order the whole system again).</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since I was 19 yrs old and i am now 27. I know that when I use it I SHOULD NOT APPLY TO MUCH PRESSURE. I have sensitive skin and I also refuse to spend $300 on a clarisonic, this always leaves my skin smooth and &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34;. Honestly I don&#x27;t like the soap very much so I rinse it off then apply my cleanser of choice. That also softens up the pad so it won&#x27;t be so abrasive when I use it. The vibrating pulse helps to circulate blood flow in the face, that is why my complexion always even and plump.</li>
            <li> This item came faster than I expected and it saved me a trip to the store, not to mention a lot compared to a professional visit. I&#x27;ve had the kit for a while and it works very well. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a cost effective way to boost surface cell turnover for firmer, younger-looking skin.</li>
            <li> I bought the original Neutrogena kit some years ago and felt that the brush was a little too gentle on my oily, coarse skin.  Was thrilled to see that these pads fit, and tried them a few times.  OUCH!  My skin is not very sensitive, but this hurt.  Even using only once a week.  I can&#x27;t imagine what these pads would do to someone with delicate, dry skin.  However, they are awesome on my neck, upper chest, and feet; also, I find these do not need to be tossed after each use (probably just the company&#x27;s way to sell you more stuff), and seem to last a while.  So it all worked out in the end.  Probably not the greatest product for the face, as it is originally intended.</li>
            <li> Love that refills are so cheap...............&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser does an awesome job removing dirt,oil and make-up.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> I love this product my skin feels and looks so much smoother and softer.  Only problem is they are hard to find enough to order.  All my friends and family want them as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this system to clear up my oily acne prone skin. When I first used this product, it worked great, but after a while my breakouts were unmanageable. One of the issues is that the pad is VERY abrasive and TOO MUCH oil was removed with each use.</li>
            <li> These refills fit the original product well and does the job intended.  I don&#x27;t find the system to be something that I particularly give much value.  I have used scrubbing cloths that, for me, seem to work better with less fuss and mess.</li>
            <li> Exfoliates, makes skin smooth and it glows afterwards. I have been using it all over my body not just the face.&lt;br /&gt;Glad that it also contains an extra head in the refill pad. I am definitely going to keep ordering.</li>
            <li> Great product....will buy again and again!</li>
            <li> It is a good product but I am not used it so everyday because I am in the sun each morning and I am worried for my skin</li>
            <li> Really good product, my skin looks really better now than before</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.  I got six boxes and plan to share them at Christmas as stocking stuffers with my daughters and granddaughter.  The soap embedded in the puff is just the right amount to cover my face and neck.  It rinses well and leaves me with a clean face.  I really enjoy using this product.  Thank you for the speedy delivery, too.</li>
            <li> I like this product because after I used it with the little device you put it on it made my face feel really soft.&lt;br /&gt;And it made my face have a glow to it.  I would recommend it very much.</li>
            <li> Love! Great product..great price!</li>
            <li> I love these!!! My skin feels so smooth after using these! I&#x27;ve had no problems (no pimples, itchiness, etc.) with them and I&#x27;m down to my last three out of a pack of 12. Will definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li> Been using this system for years and it is still the best!</li>
            <li> Looks fresh and younger after each use.</li>
            <li> So far I like it. It exfoliates and my skin definitely feels smoother after using it. I don&#x27;t really see any difference yet but I&#x27;ve only been using it twice a week for the last 2 weeks so I guess we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> Love this. It smooths my face and clears up any gunk that might be clogged on my face. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Muy bueno este sistema de microdermoabrasión. Cada vez que lo uso, la piel de mi rostro queda bien suave y con aspecto limpio.</li>
            <li> These refills go with the Microdermabrasion puff system. I use this system daily, either in the a.m. or before bed. It is an amazing product that helps to exfoliate and keep your skin smooth. Two settings on the system, slow and fast.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I save money buying this online and its so convenient I don&#x27;t have to worry about not using them as often as I would like.</li>
            <li> Good massage.  Really does help lessen fine lines.</li>
            <li> great purchase and great way to refill for the system</li>
            <li> Great little puffs, use twice a week and my skin looks and fells great.</li>
            <li> I really love the  product that you have online- for a little while I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere in my area and had to search for it elsewhere; finally, I found it on the Amazon website. I have been using it for quite some time- it helps me to remove dead skin and makes my face clean without any grease or oil upon it; I will definitely order some more in the future.</li>
            <li> one has to keep shopping around or waiting as price goes up and down but product amazing ,i only use it twice a week  but use it for elbows and heels as well</li>
            <li> I really love this effective product and it helps me with my skincare routine.  Along with exfoliating with this product three times a week, I use the L&#x27;Oreal Serum Intense, Day Lotion, Day/Night Lotion and Eye Cream.  This product is expensive, but a lot less when purchased from Amazon.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone wishing to improve and maintain their appearance.</li>
            <li> I want to say thank you because my skin has really changed and has lightened up and has brighten the I think it looks a whole lot younger than it did and I did not mean to order two mini pad because I don&#x27;t want a lot of somethings around that I&#x27;m not using and I really appreciate what you all did for me and I will be a reliable customer and all time</li>
            <li> I like these but can only use this system on occasion.  It is a bit harsh and abrasive on older, sensitive skin.  Also, I don&#x27;t recommend use during acne breakouts as your skin can get very red and irritated.  It&#x27;s a good product to use in moderation.</li>
            <li> I purchased the machine and these are the replacement pads that are offered at a great price, the product works great in the machine that you can purchase on Amazon and it&#x27;s really a wonderful system for skin care.</li>
            <li> Kind of spendy but the results are very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;If I go a week without using this my face feels  and looks dull. The pads really polish away imperfections</li>
            <li> My older skin needs more exfoliation than younger skin to keep it looking fresh and healthy. This product, a  part of a microdermabrasion system, works well for my needs. Though these are supposed to be single use puffs, I find I can use each several times before replacing. I have only used the product for a short time but I really like the results of a smoother skin.</li>
            <li> My face feels amazing!! Everyone should try it for a week and see the difference!!! Helps prevent breakouts, by really cleaning your face!</li>
            <li> This package of refills seems old or something.  They seem much rougher on my skin than usual and they don&#x27;t seem to have much cleanser in them.  I am not sure what the problem is but I have been using these pads for years and have never had this problem before.  I have even wondered it they might be counterfeit because I have never had the quality of a Neutrogena product be bad.</li>
            <li> Love this it makes my skin so healthy looking</li>
            <li> i bought the kit a few weeks ago thinking that for the price i wouldn&#x27;t me upset if it didn&#x27;t work.  the pads are excellent, after 1 use my skin felt smooth and fresh.  after using it for two weeks there is a noticeable difference in my skin.  my skin tone is more even, and there is a definite decrease in fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is a little harsh so i would recommend that you use it at night.  don&#x27;t expect to use it then go out, my skin is a little red for a few hours afterwards but no discomfort at all.</li>
            <li> Great product. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> If you have bad acne scars then this is exactly what you need in your life!!!! Literally changed my life. I have so much more confidence all thanks to this little guy! Must have for acne/acne scars!</li>
            <li> Love these... work great!</li>
            <li> This works fine for not being pricey. It does leave my face feeling fresh and I actually have gotten a couple of comments about my face looking brighter.</li>
            <li> I ordered this in Amazon as i found it cheaper here than in walmart. also the microdermabrasion system is cheaper here too. I liked the product it never fails to give my face a smooth glowing finish. I use this atleast twice a week (or when I remember too). This is a very good product to invest in. $20 dollars for a dermabrasion system. If you just want to keep your face clean and fresh this is a good product to use.</li>
            <li> Great product and price. Fast shipping. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Been using for a month. Haven&#x27;t seen some of the benefits they say you can get at this point, but I am pleased with how smooth and fresh it makes my skin.  Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love it!! More than expect compare to the price I paid. Worth the money. Easy to use and very handy</li>
            <li> I use this once a week.&lt;br /&gt;Great exfoliation. No need for professional facials with this.&lt;br /&gt;I just hope they always keep it well-stocked.&lt;br /&gt;Big Love!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this microdermabarsion system from 2005 and i will never stop !!! It does wonders for the skin !! Its a must have !!</li>
            <li> I can see a difference in my skin after using this product.  It looks cleaner/brighter.  The item arrived immediately/just as described.  I would not hesitate to buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I noticed difference in my skin in a very short time of using these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My pores are smaller&lt;br /&gt;My skin is clearer&lt;br /&gt;My skin is brighter&lt;br /&gt;My wrinkles are less noticable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the abrasion.  I takes off the dead skin!</li>
            <li> i have been looking in the local stores for these so i was very happy to have found it online!!! i love these things!! works great, makes your skin super smooth and even out skin tone...</li>
            <li> I use once a week and am very happy with the results.  find it very necessary and feels great and clean.</li>
            <li> Gets the face really clean!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a while and just realized these aren&#x27;t so easy to find in stores anymore, so that is the only reason why it gets 4 stars. Just use it twice a week and your skin will feel so much better! I like to steam open my pores and use really warm water on the puff just to try to get the most out of this product.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel brand new.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of these things! They make my face feel like a baby&#x27;s bottom. I prob use them too much but I can&#x27;t help it. I love how clean and soft my face feels. Great product.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to see these back on the market!!  I have really missed my face scrubby.  I bought another, way more expensive one trying to find a substitute when I couldn&#x27;t find the puff refills.  Needless to say I was still out there looking for a replacement and happened across the refills!  Yeah!  This system is better than the more expensive ones!</li>
            <li> Happy? Yes I am. Glad to see these little pads. It came with an attachment that fits on the old base with some Velcro and the pads attach to it. Works great. Just started so haven&#x27;t seen to much but if it works anything like the old form pads and dermabrasion cream, I&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li> The only thing I can say about this product is that it actually works! I mean doing the microdermabrasion as advertised. It&#x27;s not a perfect product for removing all age spots and other skin discoloration and wrinkles, but will surely lightened them all up.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for the System Puff Refills for over a year now, one day I decided to check out Amazon , in a matter of minutes, I found exactly what I wanted and they work great and for a good price.</li>
            <li> This works well with the microdermabrasion  system . it definitely shrunk my pores and tightened my neck . it was a little wrinkley .</li>
            <li> I am honestly starting to feel that these reviews are overly positive and are hugely exaggerated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product and found it to be extremely abrasive and left my skin red and almost painful after one attempt (this never happens usually). I buy a lot of skincare products as have had problems in the past. This product did not meet any of the claims on this site. Beware.</li>
            <li> I love these scrub pads.  Use about once a week or so and like the results of smoother looking skin.  Takes a little bit for the cleanser to come out but don&#x27;t feel as though it is a quick treatment anyway.  I enjoy taking the time for a little mini face massage and cleansing.  I have to say, I am a longtime fan of Neutrogena products.</li>
            <li> We like this product but unfortunately the box was only half full.</li>
            <li> They work great. They do what they promise.</li>
            <li> I already have the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion system and I love that these refills aren&#x27;t very costly. I&#x27;m definitely going to keep these in stock. If you haven&#x27;t bought the system yet... please do! It&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to all women to have one of these regardless of the age. I am 55 and have the skin of a 30 year old. Course I have always taken care of it with great products and genes help as well. My grandmother was 102 with great skin and her mother was almost 103, both were beautiful women and their skin never changed from the first time I ever laid eyes upon them. But also, they lived in the country and grew their own veggies and ate really well...Clean air helped as well as great spring water.Buy the system, its totally worth every dime.</li>
            <li> Love these use and toss!</li>
            <li> These are a great addition to my weekly facial skin care.  I&#x27;ve been using this Neutrogena product since 2004 and it makes my face smooth and soft.  It helps decrease pore size and keeps my complexion glowing.</li>
            <li> Love this product, visible results in 1 use, amazing product and after a few days of usage my skin feels really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I think you could take just the little circles of face sanding paper and do a better job than this vibrating handle. It vibrates but doesn&#x27;t seem to wiggle or twist the cleansing pad at all. The puff refills are fine but you could easily skip buying the little machine.</li>
            <li> I was a loyal and delighted user of the original version of this product: an exfoliating cream used with a dense foam sponge head that fit the same machine as the new pads do now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old formula and sponge gave outstanding results, and the half-inch thick foam applicator made it easy to get into the contours of my face.  The cream wasn&#x27;t heavy, it rinsed clean and after a treatment, my skin had a wonderful even texture and a glow. People noticed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason--maybe customers were making the cream and foam attachments last too long--Neutrogena stopped manufacturing the cream and foam pad attachment, and replaced them with thin discs containing a one-time use dose of exfoliant, activated with a little water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure that this was done to force repeat purchase on a set schedule if you want to keep up with the regimen--but I won&#x27;t be buying it again.  The results are not only inferior in terms of exfoliation--the product damaged my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the new method, the thin discs stay on it with a new snap-on head textured with a rough plastic surface that essentially meshes like Velcro with the felt-like layer on underside of the discs. The new head fits the old handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the disc is dampened with water, it foams...and the user exfoliates her face using the machine as with the old method.  But because there is no thick foam to cushion your face anymore, you can&#x27;t treat the creases around your nose, or your brow line without the edges of the disc scratching your skin. And, if any of the plastic textured area becomes exposed, it&#x27;s like scrubbing your face with a cheese grater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the treatment for the same number of minutes as the old formula, and ended up breaking capillaries around my nose and on my checks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After rinsing, I just couldn&#x27;t get the oily feel of the new product off my face; it is NOT the same cream as before, except for the fragrance.  My feeling was that instead of doing agreat job of exfoliating and leaving a natural glow like the old cream did, this new system did a half-assed job of exfoliating and just left an oil slick behind to fool the eye that my face was smooth.  It wasn&#x27;t. The oil came off in the shower and my skin looked stripped, blotchy and tired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a shame that in order to make a few extra bucks, Neutrogena ruined what had been one of the most effective skin care systems on the market.</li>
            <li> I have gone through 8 of these already and used it sporadically. It is an amazing product and I find it better to use my hands in scrubbing than the electric thingy. Or I would switch it around using the wand and then taking the puff and scrubbing it manually. It gets in deeper and I get the desired results after.</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin feel very soft and supple. I think that the refills should be less expensive considering that the whole kit is only about 3-5 dollars more. I would buy a new one every time, but I don&#x27;t want to contribute to the landfill. However, I still think the product itself is great and will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> This product makes your skin so clean and soft.  amazing results when using it with the Neutrogena microdermabrasion machine. good value for money</li>
            <li> A un excelente precio en comparación con el marcado en alguna tienda como Walmart, mejor precio encontrado, y los resultados si se siguen las indicaciones tal cual vienen, son excelentes! Gracias.</li>
            <li> I love the entire Neutrogena microdermabrasion system.  The machine and the pads.  Your skin feels so clean afterwards !&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended !</li>
            <li> Although I like this product, and am pretty sure that I noticed a difference in my skin (feeling softer and less bumpy) within a week, the refills (in stores) are expensive!  I was glad to see a slightly reduced price on amazon.  At this point, however,  I have taken to using the same pad at least 3-4 times.  I usually have enough of the product still on the pad when I use it the 2nd time, but by the 3rd or 4th time I put my own cleanser on the pad and then use it.  I find that does the trick just as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Neutrogena product for a couple years now &amp; I will continue to purchase it as long as it is available :)</li>
            <li> No good as i think it&#x27;s should be, I can not note the different at all after using for a month</li>
            <li> This is use with the Microdermabrasion system. I have seen this product at a higher price at the pharmacies. Good buy.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel great after I use it.</li>
            <li> finally found these for my wife. she couldn&#x27;t find them at the stores for quite some time. now maybe she can scrub her face and make it look fresh and clean again!</li>
            <li> This product did smooth my skin but my skin is just too sensitive for it. My face got really dry and even after putting on moisturizer, I still had flaky spots. To be fair, I did give the product a chance by using them every other day for 2 weeks just to see if it was the formula working to smooth out my skin and remove any impurities but the flakiness did not stop. It only stopped after I stopped using the product. My skin works better with the orange Neutrogena Wave Deep Clean Exfoliating Pads but it&#x27;s hard to find them in stores so I have to order it online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Microdermabrasion Puffs are the same size and feel as the Wave Exfoliating Pads but of course the formula is different.</li>
            <li> Easy to use refills, microdermabrasion system leaves my skin feeling soft and glowing.  I&#x27;m very happy to with this product.</li>
            <li> have used this system for awhile.  great to have two boxes delivered, then I don&#x27;t have to reorder quite so soon.</li>
            <li> I have uber dry, flaky skin. This takes care of the problem, and leaves me feeling sooo soft! Very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Smoother clearer skin. Works well</li>
            <li> A nice replenshisment of the pads used with the device I saw on Dr. Oz&#x27;s program.  I bought both.  The pads work nicely in the comfort and convenience of your own home, saving a lot of money to the spa for a facial.  \\&quot;Easy does it\\&quot;!  A little goes a long way.  Pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using this, my skin has never been smoother and pimple-free. The meds I use go on smoother and my skin looks and feels fabulous. I&#x27;m in love!!!</li>
            <li> Refills work well as usual, very happy with entire product.</li>
            <li> This product makes your skin smooth and silky. I use it every  other night and  and wake up very happy with the outcome. I highly suggest this product.</li>
            <li> Currently wash face with 4% panoxyl once a day followed by thin application of Atralin (gentle formulation rx tretinoin). Use Cetaphil oil control lotion only as needed on dry areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used to use these twice a week. I&#x27;d always do my face and then use it on my back after. Then follow with neutrogena redness reducing cleanser. I&#x27;ll update as I reintroduce this miracle. Definitely helps stretch out visits to dermatologist for peels.</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff I use, I use my hand to apply because I prefer more control and pressure that way, my face feels clean and soft...in need to look further.</li>
            <li> This was a very good deal for the amount of pads. I will be buying them again when I need more.</li>
            <li> I have weird skin.  It is either oily or dry and I tend to be dry around my mouth because of the face wash that I use.  I started using Neutrogena Microdermabrasian System and found that it smoothed my face and allowed me to properly moisterize.</li>
            <li> After 4 weeks of use of the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion system with these pads, my skin is smoother and my dark areas are fading (I also use Ambi Fade Cream which is also by Johnson and Johnson, but the microdermabrasion seems to be speeding up the process because it never worked this quickly before).  After another four weeks there is the possibility that my skin will even be firmer.  According to the package, 72% of people have noticed this effect.  The only problem is, a box of the pads are a little pricey at Target so I may continue getting them from Amazon.</li>
            <li> great value for the 24 count. New in Box and used it right away. This item goes with the microdermabrasion kit.</li>
            <li> I have been using this system for the pass year and everytime I use it my face feels smoother and smoother, as long as they keep making this I&#x27;ll keep buing</li>
            <li> purchased these for my sister and from the first usage she noticed the immidiate changes.  Would definately recomend this to anyone looking clear up their skin (after a breakout) and to lessen their oily skin.</li>
            <li> Good deal for the price. Will absolutely order this product again when needed. Works even better than expected with Neutrogena&#x27;s Microdermabrasion System. Pleased that a new attachment was included with the Puff Refills</li>
            <li> because I am satisfied, I saw a difference on my face.people tell me I look younger.I fell better.my skin is cleaner.</li>
            <li> work great! Skin feels great, and extra clean. Use it twice a week, and it is helping to keep my skin glowing</li>
            <li> I love them. I need to reorder some. How do I do it? Thank you for having it for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 5 months now. It&#x27;s true that you can really feel and see the difference after few uses. I felt a softer skin after the first use. My friends told me my skin looks brighter now. I have a very sensitive skin. It&#x27;s hard for me to use just anything, but I never breakout or get any redness with this product.  This is also cheaper than buying it in stores.</li>
            <li> I love these exfoliating pads.  After use my face feels smooth and conditioned.  I use the system  a couple of days before using a mask.  The combination makes my skin smooth and bright.</li>
            <li> This is one of those I items that I was purchasing on a regular basis when they were on Amazon prime.  Now I am back to purchasing them from a local store since they are no longer available on Prime.  The non-Prime options make the price not worth ordering online.  Now it is more cost effective to purchase these from the store.</li>
            <li> I love this product. However I could not find it in stores like Target anymore.</li>
            <li> I only use it every other sunday because I exfoliate daily, but I really like the product. This was the cheapest I found it and the refills</li>
            <li> Love this product. Easy to use and makes me feel refreshed</li>
            <li> Was requested by my daughter and she was very pleased with the results. And I have to make this longer to submit.</li>
            <li> Love the product, but it might be cheaper in a real store? These are refills, so you need to get the contraption that goes with them, but the whole set up is awesome. Makes your skin feel amazing, and the applicator gives a great massage!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new on this product, I&#x27;ve discovered recently, and I feel I&#x27;m going to love it for a long time!</li>
            <li> This works well to exfoliate for smoother skin. They are not always easy to find. I was surprised to find it for less at Target, though.</li>
            <li> This is one really works. Only issue is drying up of my skin if i over use it. Simply superb.</li>
            <li> I love these ! They clean your face very well and my face is silky smooth and works  well if you are using  Retin A!</li>
            <li> I like the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion System, it has help fade some of my brown spots. It makes my skin feel good.</li>
            <li> Years ago I had a severe allergic reaction to acne medication that I had been using on and off for years. The doctor recommended that I use a microdermabrasion system or scrub, instead of topical creams, topical swabs, or topical wipes. It works great, I do not use 3 times a week as recommended, I use once to twice a week, sometimes I reuse a puff for a second use before I throw it out.</li>
            <li> There probably isn&#x27;t anything at all wrong with the product/system...just too harsh for my skin.</li>
            <li> I love these pads. Not to harsh on my sensitive skin. I have a clearer complexion. My skin is softer smoother and looks healthy. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I have recently had some acne issues with some hormonal changing due to breastfeeding and this system is the only thing that has helped clear my skin up.&lt;br /&gt;Because my acne is hormonal it means that my skin is producing so many cells that it cant shed them and therefore my pores get clogged. I use these almost every other day to help exfoliate and it makes my skin beautiful. I feel like its helping make my complexion smoother, fine lines are dissapearing and ooo my, when I am done I feel fresh and beautiful. I am in love. I think the price is good, the results are amazing and I am happy.. it has stopped about 80% of my breakouts so I couldnt ask for more!&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy the way it feels.&lt;br /&gt;it comes with a nice cleanser in the pads that makes fine soap suds and smells good.&lt;br /&gt;easy to use, stick on, and dispose.</li>
            <li> I like it, but not  sure it is making any improvements in my skin. I have always had fairly good skin, but at 71 it seemed to look a little dry and the texture was a little different on my cheeks. I thought to try something like this. I used all the pads that came with it. The first several I put on the applicator upside down as the gritty side is very coarse. Couldn&#x27;t believe that was the surface I was supposed to be using on my skin. But I got it right finally and used the rest correctly. It didn&#x27;t seem to change the results. I ran out of the pads and so didn&#x27;t use the product for several months. Now I am back to trying it again. My skin is still fairly good but I still have the same dry spots on my cheeks. I like the moisture content in the cleaning cream in the pads. So I will  keep at it through the refills.</li>
            <li> Great product and price!  Good for the skin a d feel refreshed after a shower and then put lotion on the face!</li>
            <li> I really love the results I&#x27;m getting from the microdermabrasion system, but oh, how I hate the smell of this product. It&#x27;s like a very harsh old-lady perfume, or the smell of cheap hairspray or laundry soap.&lt;br /&gt;But, I&#x27;m sticking with it because my skin truly does glow and looks noticeably brighter. Too bad I have to smell so bad after using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for sometime now. It done a great done job and it&#x27;s convenient and easy to use. I like being able to just toss the pads when you&#x27;re done using them.</li>
            <li> I use this pad once a week as a part of my regular face maintenance. A lot cheaper than actual microdermabrasion though this is not really like the one you get at an aesthetician&#x27;s office... I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> After just one use, my skin felt smoother, cleaner, and tighter. My moisturizer seemed to soak right in after using the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion System - sooooo nice!  The next day, my moisturizer and makeup glided on smoothly.  I use each of the puffs twice - there is more than enough product on the puff to use a second time.  I also used this product after returning from a tropical vacation - my skin was peeling a bit (too much fun in the sun), and this product cleaned, smoothed, and polished my skin to reveal a sunkissed glow.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking to smooth and brighten skin.  The puff is probably a bit too abrasive to use on broken skin.  I&#x27;m so glad I purchased the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion System!</li>
            <li> Use these biweekly.I found that using it three times a week for me is a little too much. Leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. I have acne scars that have been slowly fading with this. Do not use on active acne though as it may irritate the skin further.</li>
            <li> my dermatologist said this system could help with old acne scars- after 2 weeks of use, no results yet, but I&#x27;ll give it a few more months- I ordered 24 more pads.</li>
            <li> Dearest friends,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok...so, you know I never peddle beauty products...I was NEVER an AVON lady...and I&#x27;m certainly not a Fashionista...though I did bring cognac colored purses back in style for this summer since I&#x27;ve been carrying mine for the last year and a half...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found Neutrogena Microdermabrasion System (I think $14.95 on Amazon) and I tried it for the first time yesterday before I went to rehearsal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning, I noticed that my sun spots/freckles on my face are half missing or have lightened up by more than 50%... and my 2 sun spots on my left hand have been erased completely! Some of you know how those 2 spots have been bugging me these last few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My smile lines are less noticeable and my skin looks remarkably younger!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You gotta try this stuff! I&#x27;m not kidding!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today is 12.07.2012 and I still HIGHLY recommend this product! I use it once a week.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product all the time and she just loves the way her face feels after using this microabrasion system puffs.</li>
            <li> I use these a lot....they really work well with the microdermabrasion system.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to have.  It keeps my face clean and feeling fresh..... I will admit that I  use the same pad every day for a week. I too use 1/2 squirt of neutrogena face soap, \\&quot;after you use it the first time the soap is pretty much gone. DONT GET ME WRONG. NOT COMPLAINING ABOUT THE SOAP IN PAD... I love this product and seriously recommend it...  WONDERFUL............</li>
            <li> I use these with my Neutrogena Microdermabrasion System twice a week. They lather up good and leave my skin so soft. My skin looks healthier. I don&#x27;t notice any fragrance. My 20-year-old daughter also uses them and likes them alot. I have taken to hiding my puffs, because if I don&#x27;t, they mysteriously disappear......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These puffs work great. I will continue to use them for as long as I can get them and recommend them enthusiastically.</li>
            <li> I use these pads with the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion System.  They are easy to use, convenient and inexpensive.  These pads leave my skin smooth and soft.  Love the feeling.</li>
            <li> great product will buy again</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> great service and value!</li>
            <li> The first time I tried the product, I was impressed with the after look. My skin looked clean, luminous and very soft. There&#x27;s a bit of discomfort and heat sensation on first try but on my succeeding use I didn&#x27;t experience it anymore. There were no redness or downtime whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve been using it once a week and I can&#x27;t wait to use it again!</li>
            <li> These are my favorite Microdermabrasion puffs! They work great, My skin looks refreshed without any irritation.</li>
            <li> The System Puffs work well. Just moisten and adhere to spinner. Note: can reuse with addition of abrasion cream.</li>
            <li> No me gust&amp;oacute; para uso en el rostro. El liquido que desprende es irritante a los ojos BASTANTE IRRITANTE, y la sensaci&amp;oacute;n que deja es de pegoste en la cara.</li>
            <li> Great deal, cheaper than in-store costs. Will buy again</li>
            <li> I have never ordered anything on line &amp; when it took so long for my order I didn&#x27;t know what to do . So I finally phoned your&lt;br /&gt;company &amp; reported that it was missing . It was very nice that the lady on the other end of the phone believed me &amp; sent me another&lt;br /&gt;order to replace the missing one . It was really late when it finally showed up &amp; I was afraid this order was going to go misssing as&lt;br /&gt;well . I was so glad when it did show up but it was a lot of stress knowing u had paid for something but never received it . Unfortunately now I an no to trusting ordering things on line . It was very nice of the lady to believe me . A good person !!&lt;br /&gt;So that is why I only like it . Sorry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my third box of this product and use it about once a month. I will continue to order it.</li>
            <li> I think the product is good, but very strong, so I can&#x27;t use it more than x2 a week otherwise I have breakouts.</li>
            <li> i love it it works better then anything i tries it really cleans the pores with or with out makeup on and getts allthe dirty out and makes the pores smaller</li>
            <li> This refill pack last a long time and its an awesome value to buy this size. Highly recommend this system.</li>
            <li> I had read about this system and was eager to buy it and start using it right away.  Although I just tried it out yesterday it left my face with a tingle and I felt it cleaned out any left over make up and dead skin cells from my face leaving me with a good overall feeling.  Can hardly wait till I&#x27;ve been using it a bit longer to see if all the improvements to my face actually take place.</li>
            <li> I use this product 2 times a week.  After use, my skin feels so soft and I am gradually noticing that my skin looks healthier.  Gentle enough but feels like it really does slough off the old skin.  Not too expensive relative to similar products, too</li>
            <li> I have the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion System at home.  I use it once a week so I go through puffs quickly.  These puff refills are great and at a good price.</li>
            <li> These work great! I am so happy I found these online...I can save some money and a trip to the store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sixty but look younger. this is my secret, pure and simple</li>
            <li> Love using this once/twice a week when I feel like I need to scrub away dirt and oil. Skin feels super smooth after and stays soft for days after.</li>
            <li> I have had the Neutrogena system for several months and these puffs are excellent at keeping my skin smooth and bright.</li>
            <li> I havent used them yet since i still have the ones that come with the system. however 24 puffs and that price its very useful.</li>
            <li> Received these right away - from across the country! Neutrogena brand pads, the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only small disappointment was receiving only 1 attachment head for 2 containers of the pads, but I see that was clearly stated; my mistaken assumption. I haven&#x27;t used my Microdermabrasion system long enough to know if adhesive will last thru 20 pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy - will update rating as time goes on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wanted to say these pads only needed 1 attachment head! Adhesive worked just fine for all 24 pads. Very pleased getting 24 pads for a reasonable price. I use 2-3 times a week, &amp; don&#x27;t press hard; no need to over-do the abrasion.</li>
            <li> very nice.carefully package</li>
            <li> I see the difference!!! well, buy it and save time and a lot of money. really works. I recommended it</li>
            <li> Been using these for over 2 years and very happy with this.</li>
            <li> This is the way to do it!  I love the way my skin feels after I am done using this product.  It feel invigorated and I just feel the cell renewal happening.  I am trying to get rid of some sun damage spots and I will update in a couple of months to let you know how it is going.  LOVE this product though, and it is so inexpensive you CAN afford to pamper yourself with this product.</li>
            <li> as perfect as always love getting this product plenty of refills for awhile, the packaging is great nothing gets messy it holds everything in place.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite beauty products.  I use it every other night.  Makes my skin look and feel amazing.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Came early and is exactly as described</li>
            <li> Makes my skin smooth. I follow with vit E or light almond organic oil after useage. Thank you. Arrived on time and in described new condition.</li>
            <li> Nice product! Bottles, box and bag were busted open due to shipment..Other than that, great product!Will order again..i like the fact that it came with a extra head too..thank you!</li>
            <li> We Love it  ! Usually I&#x27;m not the type of person to write a review but this product is great for the whole family.</li>
            <li> At last!  I went to quite a number of stores to purchase the refills for the system. What a disappointment not to find them. When I saw these online I was really pleased by the quantity and the price.</li>
            <li> In general I am not so great at taking care of my skin but I&#x27;ve found my skin stays pretty happy and beautiful lately because I do just one thing with consistency - I use this. I constantly find myself using and reordering this product over 5 times now. I didn&#x27;t realize how much I loved it until I run out and my skin goes back to being an absolute dry and dull nightmare. I try to use it around 3 times a week as directed but I can always tell when I need it so I go by that and it&#x27;s pretty much the same as directed so I would recommend not more than 4 times a week. My skin is so much better when I use this vs when I&#x27;m lazy and don&#x27;t. Even at my most lazy I can spare 3 minutes to run this over my face and that&#x27;s a win. You feel the smooth, fresh feeling instantly and for me that instant gratification is the draw and then it goes beyond that and lasts extremely well for a couple days.</li>
            <li> works really well, not hard to use at all start seeing results with in two weeks and very fast and effective</li>
            <li> I really like this product!  My skin is much smoother after each use and the puffs are not too abrasive-- will definitely continue to use this</li>
            <li> Fast shipment. Product as described.&lt;br /&gt;I like using it once a week and once a week I use  Neutrogena Ageless Restoratives Total Skin Renewal Puffs.&lt;br /&gt;By itself this product is too abrasive to use on the regular basis if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> i was having a hard time finding refills in store so i went ahead and ordered on here...i love this product i feel i am not getting &#x27;cheated&#x27;  for not spending boo coo bucks on the &#x27;good&#x27; stuff...i am way more satified with this..i love it!</li>
            <li> I tend to think my skin is fair and sometime sensitive. I use St. Ives green tea exfoliant, so I thought this product would help do the job better. Although my skin felt soft and more firm after each use., my face began to break out severely. I have never seen my face break out this bad. Other people have even commented on it. It gave me bad acne. I&#x27;m not a typical acne sufferer either. I am a pretty big health nut and juice, take vitamins, workout, etc so my skin stays pretty clear. Since I started using this product however, my face has produced and excreted more oil than normal. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s whats causing it to break out more,,,or if it&#x27;s the cleansing process of this product? I don&#x27;t recommend it if your face breaks out easily or if it&#x27;s sensitive.</li>
            <li> So my mom bought these for herself and its makes her skin so smooth &#x3D;)  Product came on time and was packaged nicely</li>
            <li> I have been using these pads with the attachment for 5 yrs and highly recommend! It softens lines, wrinkles and has removed sunspots and discolored areas on my face.&lt;br /&gt;It is a very good product and inexpensive way to keep your face rejuvenated:)</li>
            <li> Best price for these refills on the internet as far as I can tell. Now I have a few months supply and I don&#x27;t have to worry about reordering for awhile. Thank You Amazon!</li>
            <li> I was a bit dubious about the raves, but in the few weeks I&#x27;ve used this the improvement is quite noticeable! a lot to recieve from so inexpensive a product.</li>
            <li> I like it but i have found that one or two of those puffs to be more harsher and abrasive than the rest!</li>
            <li> Wow, I have tried every product on the market and never had results like this. I am 30 years old and have been using this system consistently for almost 2 months and my skin looks amazing. People have asked me what I have been doing!! My pores are clear, which has never happened, my frown mark on my fore head is almost gone, and my skin is soft and bright and clear!! Thank you Neutrogena!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
