            <li>I really liked it and figured why not.</li>
            <li>I see some saying this is to bright for a night light.  </li>

            <li>I love this Himalayan Crystal Salt Bowl, it is soothing and the light is calming and lovely.  </li>
            <li>and the4y really seem to help clean the air, and seem to do a great job of removing pockets of cigarette smoke from lingering through  out of the house..  </li>
            <li>Comes with the salt bowl, light bulb, cord, dimmer switch, and salt to top the bowl.</li>
            <li>It does look nice and would go in a large living room better than a bedroom.</li>
            <li>I have purchased several of these lamps as gifts and will continue to do so because they are beautiful, and we&#x27;ll priced.</li>
            <li>i have a Persian cat that lives with me full time and is inside most of the day.  </li>
            <li>I have this light in my granddaughters room</li>
            <li>and she uses it as her night light..  </li>
            <li>Its soothing, cozy, and looks great!</li>
            <li>Had to shield the light to use it at night.  </li>
            <li>It has such a nice warm glow to it.  </li>
            <li>I was delighted to find one of these lamps with not the wooden bowl...but an actual crystal salt carved bowl, filled with beautiful chunks of crystal salt.  </li>
            <li>These were HUGE in comparison to have I was expecting, but none the less very good.</li>
            <li>She says it makes her sleep better at night, but I don&#x27;t know exactly why..  </li>
            <li>Gives a nice soft light and I do think it helps my sinuses after I have had it lit.</li>
            <li>have to be honest in this review and state that i was not impressed with the packing method nor was i impressed with the way the product was handled .&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you ever wanted to say something special to someone special,  this would be the gift to buy them.</li>
            <li>It really does seem to cleanse the air and makes it seem to be more soothing..  </li>
            <li>The lamp was delivered quickly.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty</li>
            <li>company did make it right</li>
            <li>I have to keep buying new light bulbs??</li>
            <li>Bowl is larger than I thought and puts out almost too much light for a night light.  </li>
            <li>Shipping is very fast.</li>
            <li>My friends are mesmerized by it&#x27;s beauty and when I explain to them the wonders we have already experienced in my home from the work of the negative ions against and the positives in our air and homes today, they couldn&#x27;t believe it.  </li>
            <li>i was not made aware in the product review on Amazon that the electrical unit was separate from the lamp itself and that assembly would be required .&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is cute and different.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several compliments - enjoy!</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t get hot at all.  </li>
            <li>Now for the positive aspect of the product...</li>
            <li>Would recommend highly and will consider ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First lamp was missing the Crystal chunks for the top second lamp  was damaged on the top rim of bowl&lt;</li>
            <li>I really like this company</li>
            <li>but the light bulb doesn&#x27;t last....</li>
            <li>After much hassle with this company I received the lamp.  </li>
            <li>I really like this lamp.</li>
            <li>the lamp is larger than i expected and i am very pleased with the detail and carving.  </li>
            <li>the bulb replaced.. there was a light bulb included(thankfully) within the small plastic bag which held the electrical unit.&lt;br /&gt;Scattered throughout the packing material were the large pieces of salt the went into the lap itself,they were neither wrapped nor in any sort of protective material to ensure they wouldn&#x27;t break or be damaged.&lt;br /&gt;After fishing through the packing material for an hour or more searching for the large pieces of salt, i at last found all of them and assembled the lamp itself,  </li>
            <li>the lower price helping to make up for the high shipping because of weight.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>assembly itself was easy, the entire unit simply slid into the carved hole at the bottom and has a spring loaded holder on the unit itself.s that it can be removed and</li>
            <li>I live in Sinus Valley Ohio (Miami Valley)</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy again and will probably get more for other rooms of the house.</li>
            <li>I live on a fixed income</li>
            <li>The one sent to me had almost no orange in it, it was almost clear looking.  </li>
            <li>It looks so much nicer than the big chunk of rock variety.</li>
            <li>i have noticed after purchasing another smaller lamp that i am not dusting andnearly as much as before .</li>
            <li>I decided I only really needed one</li>
            <li>Fits perfectly in small places  and the glow of the light is so soothing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to know if the ion concept actually makes a difference, but I like it much better than candles.  </li>
            <li>They are pretty heavy and as I said much bigger than I initially thought but it really was a bargain</li>
            <li>but when I contacted the seller was told the shipping would be too much for me to have to pay to send if back due to the weight.</li>
            <li>Very helpful seller, and I will give the other one away as a present.</li>
            <li>It is heavy but so pretty.</li>

            <li> Very helpful seller, and I will give the other one away as a present.</li>
            <li> It is heavy but so pretty.</li>
            <li> Packaging was poor, but lamp itself is cool.</li>
            <li> box itself was extremely large and not necessary for the size of the product.&lt;br /&gt;The box was full of the usual shipping foam donuts and the product itself was not wrapped in anything other than a thin piece of tape which was sticking to only one side of the lamp.</li>
            <li> The shipping costs are almost twice as high as the item cost - because it is very heavy - it makes sense.  </li>
            <li> Hey as long as it keeps the air cleaner in her room why not..  </li>
            <li> but  this lamp has dark kind of dirty spots  on it ...</li>
            <li> I have 2 other lamps of different shape and have put this lamp in my kitchen.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a little smaller than we expected.</li>
            <li> , It came in the mail sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li> am sorry to write a negative review of the Companies shipping methods and their handling of the product it seemed cheap and as if they simply didn&#x27;t care what happened to the product after leaving their place of business.  </li>
            <li> I was curious if maybe this used a 25 watt?</li>
            <li> But,be prepared - due to weight, shipping is expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bmartin</li>
            <li> but one uses a 25 watt and the other a 15 watt.  </li>
            <li> I now have one in almost every room in the down stairs</li>
            <li> The item is very heavy so be careful when handling the shipping box.  </li>
            <li> Then the bottom of the box came apart as i began my search, to find the missing pieces of salt.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not sure why</li>
            <li> , I am not sure about the air purification yet, but, the lamp does improve the atmosphere in my room all on</li>
            <li> but sadly i was not pleased with the shipping cost i would think for 19,95 shipping plus the price of the product</li>
            <li> Not a great  experience with this order&lt;</li>
            <li> poor quality of</li>
            <li> I ordered a lamp thru Amazon from this company that was advertised at approximately $10.00, when tax and shipping applied</li>
            <li> This company is difficult to impossible to deal with.  </li>

            <li> Not a great  experience with this order&lt;br /&gt;First lamp was missing the Crystal chunks for the top second lamp  was damaged on the top rim of bowl&lt;br /&gt;The company did make it right but  this lamp has dark kind of dirty spots  on it ...poor quality of salt&lt;br /&gt;Not many Crystal chunks for the top as the photo shows</li>
            <li> I have purchased several of these lamps as gifts and will continue to do so because they are beautiful, and we&#x27;ll priced. Everyone loves them.  One of the lamps had a defective cord and they are replacing it. Shipping is very fast. I really like this company</li>
            <li> Not sure why but the light bulb doesn&#x27;t last....I have to keep buying new light bulbs??</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly in small places  and the glow of the light is so soothing.</li>
            <li> After much hassle with this company I received the lamp.  This picture does NOT! even look like what finally came.  I ordered a lamp thru Amazon from this company that was advertised at approximately $10.00, when tax and shipping applied it was over $30.00.  This company is difficult to impossible to deal with.  Tried to stop the order, they would not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it did arrive the pictured lamp looked nothing like what they sent.  These lamps are supposed to have a nice orange glow to them.  The one sent to me had almost no orange in it, it was almost clear looking.  I returned the item but not before they insisted on charging me for paying to return it.  I live on a fixed income told them that, it didn&#x27;t matter to them.  It cost me over $14.00  to return this lamp.  I will never do business with this greedy company again.  STAY AWAY FROM THEM!  JUST A WARNING.  Also as of this date they have not bothered to return the money into my bank and they got their lamp back last Friday!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate&lt;br /&gt;Salt Lake City, Ut.</li>
            <li> came on time and is what we ordered....looks...good!!!&lt;br /&gt;2nd one that that we ordered in a months time...&lt;br /&gt;I would order again!!</li>
            <li> I was delighted to find one of these lamps with not the wooden bowl...but an actual crystal salt carved bowl, filled with beautiful chunks of crystal salt.  I was even more delighted when I plugged it in and saw it&#x27;s facinating glow with all the veins running through it!!  My friends are mesmerized by it&#x27;s beauty and when I explain to them the wonders we have already experienced in my home from the work of the negative ions against and the positives in our air and homes today, they couldn&#x27;t believe it.  I would have been happy with just the difference it has made with our allergies.  What a blessing to our home.  I and my family and friends all LOVE IT !!</li>
            <li> I love this Item. Looks, and Works Great, It came in the mail sooner than I expected. It&#x27;s what I needed for my Room.Thank you</li>
            <li> I really like this lamp. It looks so much nicer than the big chunk of rock variety. Gives a nice soft light and I do think it helps my sinuses after I have had it lit. I live in Sinus Valley Ohio (Miami Valley) so I try and use it every night before I go to bed. I would definitely buy again and will probably get more for other rooms of the house.</li>
            <li> We love the look of the lamp. It&#x27;s just a little smaller than we expected. The lamp was delivered quickly.  It looks really nice in our living room.</li>
            <li> I received the product as stated by the company a day after the predetermined date of arrival.&lt;br /&gt;I have to be honest in this review and state that i was not impressed with the packing method nor was i impressed with the way the product was handled .&lt;br /&gt;The box itself was extremely large and not necessary for the size of the product.&lt;br /&gt;The box was full of the usual shipping foam donuts and the product itself was not wrapped in anything other than a thin piece of tape which was sticking to only one side of the lamp. i was not made aware in the product review on Amazon that the electrical unit was separate from the lamp itself and that assembly would be required .&lt;br /&gt;The assembly itself was easy, the entire unit simply slid into the carved hole at the bottom and has a spring loaded holder on the unit itself.s that it can be removed and the bulb replaced.. there was a light bulb included(thankfully) within the small plastic bag which held the electrical unit.&lt;br /&gt;Scattered throughout the packing material were the large pieces of salt the went into the lap itself,they were neither wrapped nor in any sort of protective material to ensure they wouldn&#x27;t break or be damaged.&lt;br /&gt;After fishing through the packing material for an hour or more searching for the large pieces of salt, i at last found all of them and assembled the lamp itself,  Then the bottom of the box came apart as i began my search, to find the missing pieces of salt.&lt;br /&gt;I am sorry to write a negative review of the Companies shipping methods and their handling of the product it seemed cheap and as if they simply didn&#x27;t care what happened to the product after leaving their place of business.  Now for the positive aspect of the product...the lamp itself is very beautiful and exceeded my expectations in regard to its size and its form . the lamp is larger than i expected and i am very pleased with the detail and carving.  i have noticed after purchasing another smaller lamp that i am not dusting andnearly as much as before . i have a Persian cat that lives with me full time and is inside most of the day.  i will say that i am very happy with the product but sadly i was not pleased with the shipping cost i would think for 19,95 shipping plus the price of the product there would have been more care in the handling of the product itself.</li>
            <li> This is cute and different. Get an amber bulb to look like the photo. Packaging was poor, but lamp itself is cool.</li>
            <li> DLM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a beautiful room accent.  It&#x27;s hard to know if the ion concept actually makes a difference, but I like it much better than candles.  Even flameless candles (because of the safety aspect of no open flame) do not provide the same sense of peacefulness that the lamp bowl provides.  The shipping costs are almost twice as high as the item cost - because it is very heavy - it makes sense.  Just be prepared for that expense... I&#x27;ve had several compliments - enjoy!</li>
            <li> ...over and above expectations for the price I paid.&lt;br /&gt;Would love to see that price again. I&#x27;d get some for gifts...the lower price helping to make up for the high shipping because of weight.&lt;br /&gt;Have ordered several of the globe style. Hope they are as nice as bowls.</li>
            <li> It has such a nice warm glow to it.  Very pretty and it doesn&#x27;t get hot at all.  It is heavy but so pretty.</li>
            <li> These were HUGE in comparison to have I was expecting, but none the less very good. I decided I only really needed one but when I contacted the seller was told the shipping would be too much for me to have to pay to send if back due to the weight. Very helpful seller, and I will give the other one away as a present. They are pretty heavy and as I said much bigger than I initially thought but it really was a bargain so I&#x27;m not going to complain!</li>
            <li> I have this light in my granddaughters room and she uses it as her night light..  She says it makes her sleep better at night, but I don&#x27;t know exactly why..  It really does seem to cleanse the air and makes it seem to be more soothing..  Hey as long as it keeps the air cleaner in her room why not..  We do leave it on all day and night..  I now have one in almost every room in the down stairs and the4y really seem to help clean the air, and seem to do a great job of removing pockets of cigarette smoke from lingering through  out of the house..  YES I DO RECOMMEND these salt lamps..</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my salt lamp. A very attractive addition to my room and what I consider a reasonable price.  I have only had my lamp for three days,so, I am not sure about the air purification yet, but, the lamp does improve the atmosphere in my room all on it&#x27;s own. But,be prepared - due to weight, shipping is expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bmartin</li>
            <li> Nice to have in the room.</li>
            <li> One of my coworkers had this in his office. I really liked it and figured why not. I keep it on in my house and love the glow it gives off. Its soothing, cozy, and looks great! Quality product! Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I have 2 other lamps of different shape and have put this lamp in my kitchen.  It looks great on my kitchen counter and makes a perfect night light for me in this area of my home.</li>
            <li> Bowl is larger than I thought and puts out almost too much light for a night light.  Had to shield the light to use it at night.  It does look nice and would go in a large living room better than a bedroom.</li>
            <li> I see some saying this is to bright for a night light.  There are 2 bowls very similar but one uses a 25 watt and the other a 15 watt.  I have the 15 watt and for a night light it would be perfect.  I was curious if maybe this used a 25 watt?</li>
            <li> This bowl exceeded my expectations. It casts a beautiful glow when lit.</li>
            <li> I love this Himalayan Crystal Salt Bowl, it is soothing and the light is calming and lovely.  A great price, packaged well and arrived in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if there are any visible health benefits, but I keep this in my office and when I&#x27;m in there, I like having it on.</li>
            <li> If you ever wanted to say something special to someone special,  this would be the gift to buy them. They will always think of you when it&#x27;s on and it will be on all the time. Trust me, mine is.</li>
            <li> Beautifully crafted, high quality and as advertised on Amazon.  The item is very heavy so be careful when handling the shipping box.  Comes with the salt bowl, light bulb, cord, dimmer switch, and salt to top the bowl. Would recommend highly and will consider ordering more in the future.</li>
