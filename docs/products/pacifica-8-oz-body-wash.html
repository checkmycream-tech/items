            <li> The bottle leaked a little, so they need to improve their closer on the bottle.</li>
            <li> I ordered this along with some French soaps hoping for one that would add moisture to my dry skin as I age, however,&lt;br /&gt;this one is not moisturizing unfortunately.</li>
            <li> The body wash is very thick and foams a lot.</li>

            <li> French Lilac has such a lovely smell. One of the best lilac scents I have ever encountered! The wash lathers nicely and is gentle on the skin. The scent doesn&#x27;t really stay on my skin after the shower, but I prefer it that way. I just find it an uplifting way to start my day. I wish the bottle was a little bigger though.</li>
            <li> So nice.  Calm scent.  Perfect for everyday use.</li>

            <li> fantastic shower gel love it</li>
            <li> Smells positively wonderful. Really smells like lilacs. Some body washes and perfumes try to imitate it but this one is the best one I have found.</li>
            <li> The Pacifica French Lilac liquid soap smells so nice and I recommend it to anyone who wants a rich smell of lilac.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff. If you like lilacs, this is like a bouquet of lilacs in a bottle.</li>
            <li> Such a soft feminine scent. Last all day.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is lovely when you&#x27;re actually using it, but it doesn&#x27;t last much beyond the shower stall.  Still, it starts my morning on a positive note.</li>
            <li> It smells just like the lilac bush in my Mom&#x27;s yard. SMELLS GREAT! and the scent stays on your skin. I highly recommend this body wash. I want more of this this.</li>
            <li> Smells heavenly and is environmentally friendly.  Yay!  I liked it so much I had to go out and buy one for a friend.</li>
            <li> This smells great.  I would buy it again.  The bottle and packaging look like something you&#x27;d get at the dollar store, but it&#x27;s a good product otherwise.</li>
            <li> I ordered this along with some French soaps hoping for one that would add moisture to my dry skin as I age, however,&lt;br /&gt;this one is not moisturizing unfortunately. It does smell wonderful while showering but does not linger. I will stick&lt;br /&gt;with the French hand milled soaps, rather than this.</li>
            <li> I love Lilac and this is a great scent;  it smells great in the shower and I am very pleased.</li>
