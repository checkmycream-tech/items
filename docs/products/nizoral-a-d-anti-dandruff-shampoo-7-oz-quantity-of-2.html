            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve used it 4 times, I can honestly say that I have NO DANDRUFF.</li>
            <li>fast ship --excellent product</li>
            <li>I put a nickel-size amount in there, mix it with warm water and apply to my scalp BEFORE I hit the shower.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really effective</li>
            <li>I am sure this is a fine product, but in my own case, nothing has changed.  </li>
            <li>, I bought it more than one time.</li>
            <li>THE best and only dandruff shampoo that works!!</li>
            <li>Ok product.</li>
            <li>Better than any dandruff shampoo on the market.</li>
            <li>; it&#x27;s best if you do it when you are just starting to lose hair though.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wash my hair more than twice a week.</li>
            <li>For me, it works better than the prescription shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not 100% sure whether the product works for dandruff or not</li>
            <li>The two-pack is a better value than what I can find at some stores in my area.</li>
            <li>But it was worthwhile.</li>
            <li>I still believe this is the best shampoo to control dandruff and dry scalp.</li>
            <li>I do a quick wash and follow it up with a nice lather that I let sit for 10 minutes or so.</li>
            <li>GOOD STUFF FAST SHIPPING</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>great product I wish they would carry it back in the stores</li>
            <li>Maybe not the original Nizoral.</li>
            <li>Originally, I purchased this product to treat a family issue with ringworm, and it did the trick.</li>
            <li>With a minimal amount in the palm of your hand this shampoo lathers up beautifully.</li>
            <li>It used to be available in high street drugstores, but not any more.</li>
            <li>Overall it is a really good dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li>I hope we can keep up the good results with just twice a week use since it is $14 per bottle at our local Target.</li>
            <li>Even greater than those more knowable such as H&amp;S.</li>
            <li>Used for about seven weeks with initial good success</li>
            <li>Product as described and delivered quickly</li>
            <li>After the first wash, I couldn&#x27;t tell a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I have struggled with Dandruff for most of my adult years.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right</li>
            <li>The fact that I received two of these for such a low price is great</li>
            <li>The new formulation smells clean, lathers well, and decreases the itchy feeling I get after using hair color/covering the gray.  </li>
            <li>;) in my head&lt;</li>
            <li>It works very well for my family!</li>
            <li>I also love the flat easy open snap top that allows me to store the container upside down to get all of the shampoo from the container</li>
            <li>fast shipping</li>
            <li>for women, balding is unacceptable and this really helped me.</li>
            <li>My way also minimizes too much of this product on my hair.</li>
            <li>plus the shipping is really fast...</li>
            <li>Yesterday was the first time that I was able to wear a black shirt and not have to shake it out every time that I stood up from my office chair to get the dandruff flakes off of it.  </li>
            <li>Regular use of this does significantly reduce and sometimes eliminate my dandruff.  </li>
            <li>It also comes extremely well-packed&lt;br /&gt;and lasts a respectable amount of time.</li>
            <li>This is the first time in my adult life I&#x27;ve ever said that.</li>
            <li>I tried two different Nizoral products, and this one is far superior to the other I tried.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I felt I needed to do something for them as they are in high schools.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I am one of the unlucky women of the world who in her mid 40s right around the time of the commencement of menopause, began to lose her hair.  </li>
            <li>and it does look like my hair is thicker, though it might be because it makes my hair super dry.  </li>
            <li>sensitive diabetic skin led me to this.</li>
            <li>Since then, I use it maybe once or twice a week to treat itchy scalp (old age) and dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My 10 yr old daughter has dandruff, and people at school were noticing.</li>
            <li>they should sell the ones that have far away expiration dates.</li>
            <li>In conjunction with supplements, I have noticed a decrease in hair loss and some new growth in the last 6 weeks of using.  </li>
            <li>Only once did I brush off my left shoulder and that was because there was only about 3 or 4 super tiny flakes.  </li>
            <li>still have some tiny scalp buildup on my left temple, but all the rest of the odd bumps have pretty much disappeared from my scalp after just 3 uses.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the main ingredient in some of the more expensive anti-balding shampoos too.</li>
            <li>After trying three different shampoos for an itchy and flaky scalp...this is by far the only one that has worked for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find in stores,but worth the search.  </li>
            <li>Not even one flake on the front of my black shirt from my goatee area, usually just eating lunch and chewing food will leave a massive amount of flakes on my chest area, not anymore, I swear after using Denorex the majority of my adult life and having it only sort of control the problem, this stuff is a God send to be able to wear black again and not be embarrassed by all the flakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> read somewhere that the active ingredient in this shampoo can encourage  hair growth, so here I am nearly 10 years later still grasping at straws.  </li>
            <li> If you use it while in the shower, some of the shampoo gets rinsed off and doesn&#x27;t contact your scalp long enough.</li>
            <li> It is not easy to find and only one drug store near me handles it and is often out of stock.  </li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> We been using this product for long time</li>
            <li> It took a long time to receive the products.</li>
            <li> So hard to find for a decent price.  </li>
            <li> I do not have a dry scalp or dandruff.  </li>
            <li> My scalp is no longer dry, flaky, and itchy.</li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s potency and results have diminished to less than 10% of it&#x27;s initial results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of different products, all of which work for a little bit, but it just masks it.</li>
            <li> had such bad dandruff (seborrhea dermatitis) that I would pick huge bits of scalp build up off my scalp</li>
            <li> Does not really help my problem</li>
            <li> Using it everyday initially, and then every other day took care of it.  </li>
            <li> In fact, the other was so unsatisfying, I dumped it out and ordered a refill of this one to replace it.</li>
            <li> I have tried a bunch in the past but this is the only one that works.</li>
            <li> We had tried every other product with no results.</li>
            <li> Usually my the chest area of my shirts gets covered in dandruff from my goatee and my shoulders and back area get covered from the flakes on my scalp.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t perform as well as expected and smells like medicine !</li>
            <li> The key to improved performance is to let it sit on your scalp for at least 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t grow my hair or make it thick, but definitely helped with my scalp issues.</li>
            <li> Then drop down to about once a week.</li>
            <li> my scalp is less visible through my hair than it was.</li>
            <li> The way I use it is I use one of those little 3oz container for traveling.</li>
            <li> swear it was bad, the kind of bad where I wouldgo into my backyard and take the commercial grade blow dryer for dogs and blow out the flakes from my hair before leaving for work, and wouldn&#x27;t dare even think about wearing black, now I can wear black again and the blow dryer can remain for the Dogs.</li>
            <li> I use it a few times a week.</li>
            <li> probably a waste of money</li>
            <li> The product arrived a few days after it was ordered and it was just as described.  </li>
            <li> Got hard to find so placed the order.</li>
            <li> Any time that I stressed out really hard, the skin buildup would appear on my scalp and the dandruff from it would be out of control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> i read on the internet that this will grow hair, or at least stop hairloss.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews of the shampoo smelling bad, it actually smells quite alright</li>
            <li> I still am the owner of a head with about 35% of my hair gone, and what remains is thin, wispy and lank.</li>
            <li> This is seriously a miracle product!</li>
            <li> I had a difficult time finding this product for awhile when the company reformulated it.  </li>
            <li> I had been years whit that ugly and very aggressive dandruff,I tried all whit no permanent results,after I tried nizoral all my disgusting dandruff was eliminated ,now I&#x27;ve using it for a while</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter, who has terrible dandruff, she has less itching and her flakes are minimizing.</li>
            <li> It gets really bad during the season change.</li>
            <li> folks have mentioned that the &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; can be off-putting, however, I don&#x27;t find it that bad at all.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever tried T-Gel, you know how bad it can be, and Nizoral is no where close to that.</li>
            <li> I use the Nizoral 2% on both my scalp and my beard/goatee area as they both flake equally as bad and yesterday...</li>

            <li> THE best and only dandruff shampoo that works!!</li>
            <li> good job.....fast shipping</li>
            <li> Been using this product since years ago. It used to be available in high street drugstores, but not any more. I&#x27;m grateful I can still find it via Internet. As per the quality, indeed the best product to keep that stubborn dandruff away. Use it as recommended and you won&#x27;t have any more issues!</li>
            <li> Great for dandruff. Even greater than those more knowable such as H&amp;S.</li>
            <li> Maybe not the original Nizoral. I&#x27;ve been using Nizoral for quite a while and recently I purchased this one from amazon. My dandruff is back and so is my hair fall.</li>
            <li> I do not have a dry scalp or dandruff.  I bought this because I am one of the unlucky women of the world who in her mid 40s right around the time of the commencement of menopause, began to lose her hair.  I am not 53 and have tried every shampoo, essential oil for massage, vitamin, mineral, etc to reverse the situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read somewhere that the active ingredient in this shampoo can encourage  hair growth, so here I am nearly 10 years later still grasping at straws.  I am sure this is a fine product, but in my own case, nothing has changed.  I still am the owner of a head with about 35% of my hair gone, and what remains is thin, wispy and lank.</li>
            <li> Ok product. Does not really help my problem</li>
            <li> Great product was introduce to this product in 1995 and to date I still believe this is the best shampoo to control dandruff and dry scalp.</li>
            <li> Believe me guys i have tried every thing nothing works but this shampoo works flawlessly . Who ever have a dandruff problem should give it a try once.</li>
            <li> This product actually works.  The key to improved performance is to let it sit on your scalp for at least 5 minutes.  Regular use of this does significantly reduce and sometimes eliminate my dandruff.  I also love the flat easy open snap top that allows me to store the container upside down to get all of the shampoo from the container and I don&#x27;t have to wait for it to trickle out when the volume of product is low.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product and would and have repurchased it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this for the Anti Dandruff properties, I bought it because I read on some websites that the anti-fungal properties in NIzoral can help make your hair thicker.  I&#x27;ve been using it about two weeks and it does look like my hair is thicker, though it might be because it makes my hair super dry.  I limit my usage to 2X a week only.  I leave it in my hair while I wash the rest of me and then rinse it off last.  The fact that I received two of these for such a low price is great and I probably won&#x27;t need to buy Nizoral again for another year.</li>
            <li> I tried two different Nizoral products, and this one is far superior to the other I tried. In fact, the other was so unsatisfying, I dumped it out and ordered a refill of this one to replace it. Originally, I purchased this product to treat a family issue with ringworm, and it did the trick. Since then, I use it maybe once or twice a week to treat itchy scalp (old age) and dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> With a minimal amount in the palm of your hand this shampoo lathers up beautifully. Great product, and great price too!</li>
            <li> Better than any dandruff shampoo on the market. Does the job. My hair dresser recommended for my husband after trying numerous dandruff shampoos. Work great!</li>
            <li> After trying three different shampoos for an itchy and flaky scalp...this is by far the only one that has worked for me. I am a hairdresser, too! Would recommend and do, to my clients.</li>
            <li> i read on the internet that this will grow hair, or at least stop hairloss. i&#x27;ve been using 2x per week with a scalp massage brush http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0028R4SRO/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_5 and leaving it for a couple of minutes. i swear i can see baby hairs on my hairline and my scalp is less visible through my hair than it was. it will take awhile so be patient, especially if you&#x27;ve been balding awhile; it&#x27;s best if you do it when you are just starting to lose hair though. for women, balding is unacceptable and this really helped me.</li>
            <li> I have eczema in my scalp. This nonprescription shampoo - Nizoral - works&lt;br /&gt;quite well so I don&#x27;t have itchy scalp. It also comes extremely well-packed&lt;br /&gt;and lasts a respectable amount of time. NOTE: It also helps my allergies&lt;br /&gt;if I don&#x27;t wash my hair more than twice a week.</li>
            <li> Nizoral is a very good ketoconazole shampoo. I use it as an anti-balding/anti-dandruff shampoo. It&#x27;s the main ingredient in some of the more expensive anti-balding shampoos too. Good stuff at $14 a bottle as of September 13 at Target.</li>
            <li> the only one that works for me. and it smells good compared to the others.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter, who has terrible dandruff, she has less itching and her flakes are minimizing. I read some reviews of the shampoo smelling bad, it actually smells quite alright (and I am big on smells). Overall it is a really good dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this shampoo.  For me, it works better than the prescription shampoo.  It is not easy to find and only one drug store near me handles it and is often out of stock.  For convenience, I buy it through Amazon at about the same price I would pay at the drug store; but, I save the trip of about eight miles through city traffic.</li>
            <li> I have tried a bunch in the past but this is the only one that works. I use it a few times a week.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with Dandruff for most of my adult years. It gets really bad during the season change. I have also been losing hair for the last 10 years. I&#x27;m not bald, just thinning. I&#x27;ve tried a number of different products, all of which work for a little bit, but it just masks it. The dandruff always returns. Nizoral said it would deal with both dandruff and hair fall out, and it could used only once a week. I ordered this out of frustration and crossed my fingers that it would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve followed the instructions using it every 3-4 days now for two weeks. I do a quick wash and follow it up with a nice lather that I let sit for 10 minutes or so. After the first wash, I couldn&#x27;t tell a huge difference. I didn&#x27;t get the &amp;#34;good burn&amp;#34; that some people talk about either. After the second wash though, I could tell my scalp was improving. Now that I&#x27;ve used it 4 times, I can honestly say that I have NO DANDRUFF. This is the first time in my adult life I&#x27;ve ever said that. This is seriously a miracle product! The bottle says to continue the once ever 3-4 days thing for up to 8 weeks. Then drop down to about once a week. I will try the once a week washing sooner than 8 weeks for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some folks have mentioned that the &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; can be off-putting, however, I don&#x27;t find it that bad at all. If you&#x27;ve ever tried T-Gel, you know how bad it can be, and Nizoral is no where close to that. I use a touch of conditioner afterward and there is no trace. I totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Glad we found this! My 10 yr old daughter has dandruff, and people at school were noticing. We had tried every other product with no results. A friend who used to work in a salon told me about this.. we saw a drastic improvement in one use. I hope we can keep up the good results with just twice a week use since it is $14 per bottle at our local Target. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Works great. But well expire before i use both bottles. they should sell the ones that have far away expiration dates. Not the oldest bottles in stock</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had issues with dandruff &amp; oily scalp, &amp; this shampoo totally&lt;br /&gt;cleared them up for me. A+++.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again.</li>
            <li> fast ship --excellent product</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t grow my hair or make it thick, but definitely helped with my scalp issues.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working wonders. My scalp is no longer dry, flaky, and itchy.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist suggested this for scalp problems (itch and pimples).  Using it everyday initially, and then every other day took care of it.  It&#x27;s hard to find in stores,but worth the search.  I have no idea if it works on dandruff, as that was not my issue. I&#x27;ve used it for almost 10 years.</li>
            <li> My daughter had cradle cap as an infant and has always struggled with oily deposits/dandruff on her scalp. She is now a teen ager, but this is the only product we have found that eliminates it.</li>
            <li> If you have seborrhea dermatitis and for some reason your dermatologist won&#x27;t prescribe you the 2% then you may as well get the over the counter 1%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologist prescribed me the 2% and since the generic is only about $8.00 for a 4oz bottle I went with that.  I gotta say, it&#x27;s a miracle worker for me so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had such bad dandruff (seborrhea dermatitis) that I would pick huge bits of scalp build up off my scalp, I knew I shouldn&#x27;t as it would make my scalp bleed but I just couldn&#x27;t stop myself.  Any time that I stressed out really hard, the skin buildup would appear on my scalp and the dandruff from it would be out of control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;ve been using the 2% now for only about 3 showers and it&#x27;s a night and day difference.  Yesterday was the first time that I was able to wear a black shirt and not have to shake it out every time that I stood up from my office chair to get the dandruff flakes off of it.  Only once did I brush off my left shoulder and that was because there was only about 3 or 4 super tiny flakes.  Usually my the chest area of my shirts gets covered in dandruff from my goatee and my shoulders and back area get covered from the flakes on my scalp.  But after only 3 uses of the 2% it&#x27;s almost all gone now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have some tiny scalp buildup on my left temple, but all the rest of the odd bumps have pretty much disappeared from my scalp after just 3 uses.  I use the Nizoral 2% on both my scalp and my beard/goatee area as they both flake equally as bad and yesterday... Not even one flake on the front of my black shirt from my goatee area, usually just eating lunch and chewing food will leave a massive amount of flakes on my chest area, not anymore, I swear after using Denorex the majority of my adult life and having it only sort of control the problem, this stuff is a God send to be able to wear black again and not be embarrassed by all the flakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I swear it was bad, the kind of bad where I wouldgo into my backyard and take the commercial grade blow dryer for dogs and blow out the flakes from my hair before leaving for work, and wouldn&#x27;t dare even think about wearing black, now I can wear black again and the blow dryer can remain for the Dogs.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended that I rotate this shampoo with Selsun Blue and DHS Zinc shampoo.  The routine seems to help my scalp condition.</li>
            <li> great product I wish they would carry it back in the stores</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say as it did anything a regular head and shoulders didn&#x27;t do........probably a waste of money</li>
            <li> NIZORAL is the BEST and it always works for me. It&#x27;s somewhat my American Express card. I don&#x27;t leave home without it...</li>
            <li> Relieves itchy scalp and also removes spray net build up. Great product.</li>
            <li> GOOD STUFF FAST SHIPPING</li>
            <li> The product arrived a few days after it was ordered and it was just as described.  I&#x27;m not 100% sure whether the product works for dandruff or not but the seller certainly did as excellent a job as could be hoped for.</li>
            <li> I buy this for female hair loss.  In conjunction with supplements, I have noticed a decrease in hair loss and some new growth in the last 6 weeks of using.  I had a difficult time finding this product for awhile when the company reformulated it.  The new formulation smells clean, lathers well, and decreases the itchy feeling I get after using hair color/covering the gray.  The two-pack is a better value than what I can find at some stores in my area.</li>
            <li> This product is the only thing that works for my scalp psoriasis. The way I use it is I use one of those little 3oz container for traveling. I put a nickel-size amount in there, mix it with warm water and apply to my scalp BEFORE I hit the shower. Since you want max contact with your scalp for about 5-10 minutes, this method works great. If you use it while in the shower, some of the shampoo gets rinsed off and doesn&#x27;t contact your scalp long enough. My way also minimizes too much of this product on my hair. This is for the scalp, not hair.</li>
            <li> Your scalp will feel amazing.  I only need to use once a week so it lasts a long time.  My issue was itchy scalp, but no longer!</li>
            <li> We been using this product for long time it&#x27;s really effective and I can recommend this to anyone. plus the shipping is really fast...</li>
            <li> Heard &amp; read great reviews about this product.  Purchased two bottles.  Used for about seven weeks with initial good success but now it&#x27;s potency and results have diminished to less than 10% of it&#x27;s initial results.</li>
            <li> This is the only anti-dandruff treatment that actually helped me to get rid of dandruff and itching. I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> So hard to find for a decent price.  This one was a good price and also arrived within days.  As for the product well yes it&#x27;s Nizoral great product for the hair.</li>
            <li> Nizoral works for me. I use it occasionally, and it does the trick. HBC Depot shipped my order correctly and promptly (with Amazon Prime).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All&#x27;s well.</li>
            <li> I had been years whit that ugly and very aggressive dandruff,I tried all whit no permanent results,after I tried nizoral all my disgusting dandruff was eliminated ,now I&#x27;ve using it for a while and there is no trace of dandpoop ;) in my head&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it...you&#x27;ll see the results</li>
            <li> This is excellent product. We had been struggling with my husband&#x27;s scalp, itching and redness for years. We went to Walmart and the pharmacist recommend us this product. I ordered from Amazon since Walmart did not have it and we are so please with this product, this is the only shampoo that has worked for my husband.</li>
            <li> Recommended by our Dermatologists to control what I call face dandruff.  That peeling skin in your eyebrows and nose will wash away and stay away for quite a time.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re losing your hair, you need to use this.</li>
            <li> Great... It works very well for my family!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t perform as well as expected and smells like medicine !</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my two sons who were suffering with dandruff for years. I felt I needed to do something for them as they are in high schools. It took a long time to receive the products. Almost about two months. But it was worthwhile. The result was almost immediate. Very satisfied with how well this product worked. I have two happy sons with free of dandruff.</li>
            <li> Product as described and delivered quickly</li>
