            <li>Still a great eyeliner nonetheless.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame, because I think it would have been a great eyeliner.</li>
            <li>This is a great product because the felt tip never collapsed on me.</li>
            <li>It was amazing!</li>
            <li>I love this slim liquid eyeliner, I can make perfect cat eyes with this.</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner!</li>

            <li>I love this eyeliner!</li>
            <li>I also want to say how amazing shipping was.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a nice eyeliner, kind of like a marker...</li>
            <li>Oh well, I really liked it</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s too good to be true, it IS too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I love the eyeliner</li>
            <li>and she said she liked the way it went on so smoothly</li>
            <li>The package of the eyeliner is cute, and the quality of the eyeliner is also pretty good.</li>
            <li>i bought this as a gift for my daughter, and she just loved it, the packaging was pretty</li>
            <li>I ordered this thinking that it would work better for the fine detailing I do with my eyeliner (spirals and lace designs).</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll keep buying it till I fine something better</li>
            <li>LOve love love love this so much</li>
            <li>I like how easy it is to take off.</li>
            <li>but this one makes it easy.</li>
            <li>The first 2 days that i had it, it worked amazingly.</li>
            <li>Super pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Hello :) I absolutely adored this eyeliner, its super cute and love the packaging.</li>
            <li>I have ordered this eyeliner before, but from a different website (can&#x27;t remember where) and it was a great product, so when I ran out I saw how cheap it was here and ordered it.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nt even worth your time!</li>
            <li>/&gt;it isn&#x27;t poky or so hard that you don&#x27;t wanna use it :D</li>
            <li>I recieved this package around the time estimated and overall its good.</li>
            <li>I love that the tip is so extra fine!</li>
            <li>It shipped very quickly, but that and the very fine tip on the liner are the only saving grace.</li>
            <li>Buuuuut, I will say that the eyeliner is jet black and has a great tip for precision.</li>
            <li>The line is so fine, you really can&#x27;t screw it up.</li>
            <li>would say it was worth the price i paid.</li>
            <li>It says China right on the package, so why is that a surprise to anyone?</li>
            <li>Also, the eyeliner didn&#x27;t have any type of seal on it, it just opened right up out of the packaging.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised to see this product was shipped so quickly to my home!</li>
            <li>I will be buy more and the price is cheap and its really black thank you for making such a amazing liner</li>
            <li>and it is indeed very much that shade.</li>
            <li>Also, the shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>I was aware it wasn&#x27;t Dolly Wink.</li>
            <li>it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Regardless of where it came from or who made it, I really like this liner!</li>
            <li>Even though it is not labeled so it appears to be exactly the same as the Dolly Wink brand eyeliner, in fact I was sure that it was however</li>
            <li>For the first three days.</li>
            <li>To begin with the package actually arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>Works very well</li>
            <li>is this real one?</li>
            <li>But the product it&#x27;s self is very recomendable.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and it came fast.</li>
            <li>however it&#x27;s nice if your looking for something not to harshly define.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was very black and perfect for a week or two of using it but eventually it seemed as if it dried out.</li>
            <li>how convenient it is.&lt;br /&gt;it is much like the original brand only ..</li>
            <li>It does not stay, it smudges and is most certainly not waterproof!</li>
            <li>I usually trust Korean brands because I am Korean, and I know my country usually makes excellent products...</li>
            <li>I dont recommend this product unless you are willing to open one and throw it in the trash can as soon as you use it the first time</li>
            <li>but this one is slimmer with a much finer point, but the tip is still soft so its not stiff against the eye.</li>
            <li>It goes on fairly smooth, different than regular liquid eyeliner pens I&#x27;ve used though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give this a three because it is much like the original dolly wink brand, the only problem is that it feels heavy on your eye if you apply too much</li>
            <li>I can agree the packaging wasn&#x27;t sealed very well, as in you could just pop it open.</li>
            <li>I bought several eyeliners from this seller, and this is the eyeliner I first tried after I open the package.</li>
            <li>like the makeup might not have been made like yesterday, but it still works really well...much better than those horrid ones that come with a little ink-type bottle and a hard stick</li>
            <li>I have used it for several times, no complaints so far.</li>
            <li>When i got this in japan, it was more thin stick and stay longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it last a long time, is easy to put on , and is a very dark balck!</li>
            <li>The actual felt tip on the eyeliner was worn down, and to top it off what little product does come out is not what is advertised!</li>
            <li>/&gt;About halfway through the first line, it dried up.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> /&gt;About halfway through the first line, it dried up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I agree that it seems a bit dry....</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t i was kind of disappointed with the results.</li>
            <li> The only thing is you do have to reapply after 5-6 hours but other that it works like a dream!!</li>
            <li> But I really do not recomend this product.</li>
            <li> , i stil use it but not as much as my other stuff</li>
            <li> Con, due to its difference in application it took me a minute to figure it out.</li>
            <li> The product package was not sealed properly, and the actually eyeliner was dry and almost useless.</li>
            <li> because the product wasn&#x27;t as dark as i&#x27;d like it to be...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s dark black and is now a gray- black.</li>
            <li> , i bought mine in the color black</li>
            <li> It takes a few times to get the colour to stick</li>
            <li> This liquid eyeliner dried out on me in about 2 days.</li>
            <li> It dried out like a week after I opened the package.</li>
            <li> I was very wrong, this eyeliner is nearly dried out it seems, and I bought it brand new.</li>
            <li> This is a fake product that looks similar to the koji dolly wink liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> in all, a terrible and cheap product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fell thick and cakey.</li>
            <li> I was just disappointed that it did&#x27;t look like the cute pink eyeliner in the picture (which is why I wanted it) but it was brown and boring.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of liquid liner and I really am *not* good at them....</li>
            <li> i dont hate the product but just wished for a softer brush,because it was a little to hard on my eye</li>
            <li> and it makes it difficult to blink or close your eye.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> was not totally impressed used it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it was used, but it was a bit difficult to tell.</li>
            <li> Just by looking at the photos, I can already tell it is a FAKE and DUPE of the Dolly Wink eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to apply it on my skin.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> But upon opening he box I was almost immediately disappointed by the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> it if you don&#x27;t mind being disappointed and wasting your $6.00</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to stock up before they stop making them or something stupid....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a bad scam!</li>

            <li> The package is cute. I was aware it wasn&#x27;t Dolly Wink. It takes a few times to get the colour to stick but it isn&#x27;t too bad. I give it three stars.</li>
            <li> Hello :) I absolutely adored this eyeliner, its super cute and love the packaging. it works pretty well. I like how easy it is to take off. I also want to say how amazing shipping was. I ordered it on august 1st, and it was delivered today, august 3rd. I paid for standard shipping and It was estimated to be delivered august 5th-7th. so im extremely happy with the product.</li>
            <li> This liquid eyeliner dried out on me in about 2 days. The first 2 days that i had it, it worked amazingly. But I really do not recomend this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get what I was expecting. I&#x27;ve been told this will look amazingly beautiful but it doesn&#x27;t i was kind of disappointed with the results.</li>
            <li> Obviously it&#x27;s a Chinese knock-off...It says China right on the package, so why is that a surprise to anyone? If you wanted &amp;#34;Dolly Eyes&amp;#34; just buy it!! This is a knock-off....&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of where it came from or who made it, I really like this liner! I love that the tip is so extra fine! I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of liquid liner and I really am *not* good at them....but this one makes it easy. The line is so fine, you really can&#x27;t screw it up. Plus it lasts and stays where you put it.&lt;br /&gt;I agree that it seems a bit dry....like the makeup might not have been made like yesterday, but it still works really well...much better than those horrid ones that come with a little ink-type bottle and a hard stick you&#x27;re supposed to use as a &#x27;brush&#x27; ((shudder))&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this as an awesome product, and for the money you can&#x27;t beat it! I&#x27;ll have to stock up before they stop making them or something stupid.... lol</li>
            <li> Where to begin?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this item to draw lines on my eyes similar to Dahvie Vanity from BOTDF. I usually trust Korean brands because I am Korean, and I know my country usually makes excellent products... I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About halfway through the first line, it dried up. I shook it and even recapped it. But nothing worked. I had to use a different pen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day I used it again... And the tip fell off! All the &#x27;ink&#x27; that never came out when I was using it for makeup spilt out onto the floor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a terrible and cheap product. Buy something else.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner! It&#x27;s similar to the ELF brand liquid eyeliner pen but this one is slimmer with a much finer point, but the tip is still soft so its not stiff against the eye. Works very well, i bought mine in the color black and it is indeed very much that shade. Super pleased with this product. Also, the shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give this a three because it is much like the original dolly wink brand, the only problem is that it feels heavy on your eye if you apply too much and it makes it difficult to blink or close your eye.&lt;br /&gt;I would repurchase this again because of the price and how convenient it is.&lt;br /&gt;it is much like the original brand only ..stickier i guess on the eyelid.</li>
            <li> LOve love love love this so much I will be buy more and the price is cheap and its really black thank you for making such a amazing liner</li>
            <li> I love this slim liquid eyeliner, I can make perfect cat eyes with this. It comes out so smooth, and it is not blotchy!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a nice eyeliner, kind of like a marker... why did i say marker? because the product wasn&#x27;t as dark as i&#x27;d like it to be... however it&#x27;s nice if your looking for something not to harshly define.&lt;br /&gt;it isn&#x27;t poky or so hard that you don&#x27;t wanna use it :D , i stil use it but not as much as my other stuff</li>
            <li> To begin with the package actually arrived very quickly. But upon opening he box I was almost immediately disappointed by the quality of the product. Even though it is not labeled so it appears to be exactly the same as the Dolly Wink brand eyeliner, in fact I was sure that it was however it is not, so don&#x27;t be fooled by the dotted color sceme. Furthermore, it was as if it had already been used! The product package was not sealed properly, and the actually eyeliner was dry and almost useless. The actual felt tip on the eyeliner was worn down, and to top it off what little product does come out is not what is advertised! It does not stay, it smudges and is most certainly not waterproof! Do not be fooled by their packaging! His is not Dolly Wink! It&#x27;s nt even worth your time! It&#x27;s like a bad scam!</li>
            <li> I bought several eyeliners from this seller, and this is the eyeliner I first tried after I open the package. The package of the eyeliner is cute, and the quality of the eyeliner is also pretty good. I have used it for several times, no complaints so far.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised to see this product was shipped so quickly to my home! I can agree the packaging wasn&#x27;t sealed very well, as in you could just pop it open. There was no tape or sealed packaging. Also, the eyeliner didn&#x27;t have any type of seal on it, it just opened right up out of the packaging. Buuuuut, I will say that the eyeliner is jet black and has a great tip for precision. And for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it. I would recommend buying this product.</li>
            <li> It was very black and perfect for a week or two of using it but eventually it seemed as if it dried out. I opened up the back and put a drop of water inside in attempts to fix it. It worked...somewhat. The pen lost it&#x27;s dark black and is now a gray- black. Still a great eyeliner nonetheless.</li>
            <li> is this real one? When i got this in japan, it was more thin stick and stay longer.&lt;br /&gt;So I just gave to my friend.lol</li>
            <li> I recieved this package around the time estimated and overall its good. I enjoy the product and I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> It was amazing! For the first three days. Then it just stopped forking. Oh well, I really liked it and I think I&#x27;ll buy another one to use for cosplaying only.</li>
            <li> I ordered this thinking that it would work better for the fine detailing I do with my eyeliner (spirals and lace designs). I was very wrong, this eyeliner is nearly dried out it seems, and I bought it brand new. It shipped very quickly, but that and the very fine tip on the liner are the only saving grace. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again, or recommend it to anyone else.</li>
            <li> i dont hate the product but just wished for a softer brush,because it was a little to hard on my eye</li>
            <li> was not totally impressed used it a couple of times then it seem to be running out of liquid. would say it was worth the price i paid.</li>
            <li> It dried out like a week after I opened the package. I dont recommend this product unless you are willing to open one and throw it in the trash can as soon as you use it the first time</li>
            <li> I received my eyeliner from Fashion.Connection. The packaging wasn&#x27;t sealed like it should have been, and the eyeliner wasn&#x27;t factory sealed. I don&#x27;t think it was used, but it was a bit difficult to tell. It&#x27;s a shame, because I think it would have been a great eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I love the eyeliner it&#x27;s like perfect for my life and I&#x27;ll keep buying it till I fine something better or till I can afford to buy the dolly wink one</li>
            <li> This is a great product because the felt tip never collapsed on me. It doesn&#x27;t smudge, nor does the eyeliner dry-out</li>
            <li> it was great!! it does what it needs to do and the color is perfect!</li>
            <li> This is a fake product that looks similar to the koji dolly wink liquid eyeliner. I&#x27;m afraid to apply it on my skin.</li>
            <li> Just by looking at the photos, I can already tell it is a FAKE and DUPE of the Dolly Wink eyeliner. Packaging is completely different, whether looking at the plastic packaging or the liquid eyeliner itself. Description says it is Made in China, and it is. Only China has manufactured dupes of Dolly Wink. Another big giveaway is the fact that it&#x27;s selling for ONLY 1 CENT, not including shipping. How can you fall for that. If it&#x27;s too good to be true, it IS too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it if you don&#x27;t mind being disappointed and wasting your $6.00</li>
            <li> I have ordered this eyeliner before, but from a different website (can&#x27;t remember where) and it was a great product, so when I ran out I saw how cheap it was here and ordered it. I was just disappointed that it did&#x27;t look like the cute pink eyeliner in the picture (which is why I wanted it) but it was brown and boring. But the product it&#x27;s self is very recomendable.</li>
            <li> It goes on fairly smooth, different than regular liquid eyeliner pens I&#x27;ve used though. It doesn&#x27;t fell thick and cakey. I don&#x27;t even fell it there. That&#x27;s a big pro. Con, due to its difference in application it took me a minute to figure it out. You&#x27;re supposed to close your eye and just glide it sideways along the lashline.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner! it last a long time, is easy to put on , and is a very dark balck! The shipping was fast and it came fast. The only thing is you do have to reapply after 5-6 hours but other that it works like a dream!!</li>
            <li> i bought this as a gift for my daughter, and she just loved it, the packaging was pretty and she said she liked the way it went on so smoothly</li>
