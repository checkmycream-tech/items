    <ol>
            <li>:D  </li>
            <li>Was very happy that I found it thru Amazon.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s best use would be as primer or undercoat for another preferred color.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVED this product!</li>
            <li>lol).</li>
            <li>This works great as a nail hardener while you are trying to grow out split nails.  </li>
            <li>So wasn&#x27;t happy about that.  </li>
            <li>I have tried to grow my nails out but never have been successful.  </li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>Good luck getting even silk wraps or nail glue to do that</li>
            <li>Allow a good 30 min if you use this topcoat!&lt;br /&gt;6-</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>But MOST of all, read the product directions to ensure you get the most out of this wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>hope this review will help those seeking to find a great EASY way to help mend a weak/split</li>
            <li>Excellent product, quick drying, easy to use.</li>
            <li>The filing/buffing, the papers, the GLUE, more buffing, then smoothing, and on and on.</li>
            <li>I forget the name of this OPI product, but I am sure you can find it on the OPIweb site.</li>
            <li>I now buy the 3-pack off of Amazon, just to make sure I am never without it.</li>
            <li>Just follow with a top coat.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Wraps protects them better than anything else I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I bought this item at a grocery store but see better prices for it here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Most of all...it will add super strength to the nail!  </li>
            <li>sure to brush your nail products over the free edge of your nail.</li>
            <li>aside from hoping it will continue to be available for me to purchase for MANY decades to come.</li>
            <li>it is so smooth.</li>
            <li>Thus far Great product ... Will be ordering very soon.</li>
            <li>As a guitarist I find it a constant challenge to keep my nails in optimum condition.</li>
            <li>I mention this because I feel the person who gave this product only 2 stars, did not write a fair review.</li>
            <li>Using a daily cuticle oil application (ie Solar Oil, etc) is also a good idea.</li>
            <li>Looks good as a sheer polish too.</li>
            <li>best way to make any nail polish adhere is to lightly file the surface of the nail; HOWEVER, if you have thin or splitting nails to begin with -- this is not something you should do.</li>
            <li>This won&#x27;t be as shiny as the CND \\&quot;Super Shiney\\&quot;, but it&#x27;s still shiney.</li>
            <li>then they break or split at the quick.</li>
            <li>Sometimes you need to mend a nail \\&quot;right away\\&quot;, not in 5+ days after ordering online.</li>
            <li>This is a super super product and I have used it for YEARS.&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, please be realistic about what this product can and cannot do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Broken, chipped,cracked, and splitting nails are a hindrance to accurate fretwork,there sill strength required to carry out the expressive attack,essential to an exciting performance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the best product I have ever used to help \\&quot;mend\\&quot; a split or weak fingernail!</li>
            <li>Your product,while very attractive and easy to apply could not sustain the durable protection I had hoped for.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the problem does not lie with No More Wraps but is due to the fact that I have a calcium deficiency.</li>
            <li>I have not broken a nail since I put it on!</li>
            <li>2 coats will give you a pretty milky cover --</li>
            <li>If you need 2 coats of this product, use an actual nail polish \\&quot;color\\&quot; over it, and of course, always end with a top coat.  </li>
            <li>It did exactly what it says it does</li>
            <li>I had given up on polishes because I would put them on and even with a under coat and top coat I would need to remove the polish by the next day.  </li>
            <li>Applied exactly as instructed.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t return it so, to justify the expense, I now seal it with a top coat before it&#x27;s completely dry.  </li>
            <li>No gritty bits, just smooth milky colour</li>
            <li>A lot of them have very brittle nails</li>
            <li>I really like the way it feels when it is on</li>
            <li>The polish works really well.</li>
            <li>And is very durable.</li>
            <li>Wonderful smooth base for polish and finish with Liquid Glass.</li>
            <li>and I love nail polish, but I have a pesky vertical weak spot in one of my fingers that will \\&quot;split\\&quot; as it grows out to the free edge of the nail.</li>
            <li>so I would not advise using only a clear np over 2 coats of No More Wraps -- it won&#x27;t look that attractive.</li>
            <li>I highly doubt it, though I haven&#x27;t tried.</li>
            <li>Apply topcoat (usually, I use Seche Vite rapid dry topcoat, but if I want REALLY shiney nails, I use Creative Nail Design \\&quot;Super Shiney\\&quot;!</li>
            <li>as you would a nail polish, to clean dry nails.</li>
            <li>You must seal it with nail polish (use clear, if you don&#x27;t want a color!), and then you must follow up with a topcoat.</li>
            <li>I am really excited because I can put a dark color on and remove it with remover.  </li>
            <li>Without this product, I&#x27;d have to keep my nails filed super short to avoid the split going deep --- OUCH!</li>
            <li>(works for a day, if that, for a large split -- doubt it would stick back on a chipped off piece of nail</li>
            <li>-- it is a MATTE formula, so it is clear, but not with a girly \\&quot;shine\\&quot; to it.</li>
            <li>I prefer clear as I don&#x27;t wear colored polish.</li>
            <li>Is clear.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a nail biter very since i was a kid, and it wasnt untill recently that i stopped.</li>
            <li>it repair/mend a completely \\&quot;chipped OFF\\&quot; piece of a fingernail?</li>
            <li>Again, let dry between coats -- esp in HOT humid weather.&lt;br</li>
            <li>for the first two weeks, i put on my entire nail,and now, for extra protection, i put it on, and under my nails too!     </li>
            <li>And be realistic -- if you are constantly running your hands under water (as I am, washing dishes, bathing my puppy, washing my hair, gardening, etc), then use rubber gloves.</li>
            <li>Ships really fast too, so you you dont&#x27;t have to wait long for it to arrive.</li>
            <li>And I constantly use hand cream and wash dishes with gloves on,  I much prefer the Instant Artificials.</li>
            <li>I applied this product in thin layers, one coat on top of nail as well as under nail.</li>
            <li>And btw, I use it on ALL my nails eventhough only one has the vertical split issue, since my nails tend to be weak over all (tend to tear easily from the side).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very long natural nails</li>
            <li>so I need extra help if I want to keep my nail length to grow past the free edge), I will use NAIL TEK II (or NAIL TEK XTRA) as a \\&quot;maintenance topcoat\\&quot; -- applied every other day.</li>

            <li> Dry well between coats ...about 5 min between each of my nail product</li>
            <li> but it does take longer to dry.</li>
            <li> The directions clearly state to use 1-2 coats of No More Wraps, and allow to dry between coats.</li>
            <li> BUT if you are a guy needing to use this product, you can use 1 coat of No More Wraps, followed by OPI clear nail polish for Men</li>
            <li> Not as hard as laminate worktop but nearly!</li>
            <li> an inch long (this is past the finger tip)..</li>
            <li> You can still see your nailbed color through, but it has a slightly milky barely-there color to it.</li>
            <li> nails use to split at about half longer than my nail bed</li>
            <li> At the very least, use a hand creme daily.</li>
            <li> I found this to be a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> And as soon as I used a cuticle oil or hand creme -- it was all over -- the wrap would \\&quot;lift\\&quot; after a few days&#x27;</li>
            <li> Any manicure will get destroyed if you do not apply your products correctly, as well as if you are harsh on your nails/hands.</li>
            <li> I basically never use it, so it was a waste of money</li>
            <li> My recommendation: don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have a broken nail that is really low</li>
            <li> They are very weak especially at the ends.  </li>
            <li> I feel that when people do not use a product correctly, and then post a bad review, that really hurts those of us who are truly looking to reviews to help us decide on a purchase.  </li>
            <li> No more peeling, but it does chip.  </li>
            <li> It seems they used No More Wraps as a stand-alone product, and that is not the correct useage of the product.</li>
            <li> Then begin application of No More Wraps, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li> Way of Applying No More</li>
            <li> dry.&lt;br /&gt;3- Apply 1-2 coats of No More Wraps (I usually use 1 coat on non-split nails, and 2 coats on problem nail)</li>
            <li> /&gt;One coat of No More Wraps on my nails looks like a transluscent (NOT \\&quot;transparent\\&quot;) cover.</li>
            <li> Not sure what you would do for a topcoat, though?</li>
            <li> It is no better than ordinary nail polish...</li>
            <li> at least the XTRA does (not sure about the \\&quot;II\\&quot; formulation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to imagine how nail wraps can come out of a bottle but believe me</li>
            <li> No I didn&#x27;t apply it too thick.</li>
            <li> Just because it says LAMINATE doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s permanent,as it will be removed with polish remover.</li>
            <li> I have very thin nails due to medication and this No More&lt;br</li>
            <li> it mend a small split in a nail or strengthen weak, thin, and/or ridged nails?</li>
            <li> Was a little skeptical about this product, but my mind was changed when I used it.  </li>
            <li> This chips off and dries out your nails, especially if they&#x27;re already in bad shape.</li>
            <li> May try this as a middle layer instead of a base.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried hardners,&lt;br /&gt;etc., but sometimes I feel they make my nails worse.  </li>
            <li> It is difficult to rate a product that you haven&#x27;t used, so please disregard my rating and comments as I could not delete the stars after opening this page.</li>
            <li> We have a bad problem with getting the darker colors and sparkle polish off of their nails.  </li>
            <li> After reading the review I was so disappointed.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent product, quick drying, easy to use. I have not broken a nail since I put it on! Good price. It is not unattractive if worn alone.</li>
            <li> My nails split and peel, so I wanted something to seal them.  I tried this product alone and hours later, after a bath, it peeled.  Water got under it and it peeled off like stickers.  Couldn&#x27;t return it so, to justify the expense, I now seal it with a top coat before it&#x27;s completely dry.  No more peeling, but it does chip.  May try this as a middle layer instead of a base.  Will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> I found this to be a waste of money.  This chips off and dries out your nails, especially if they&#x27;re already in bad shape.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to imagine how nail wraps can come out of a bottle but believe me it&#x27;s possible with this product.  Just paint it on your nails, it glides on like nail polish. No gritty bits, just smooth milky colour, two coats makes it white. Wonderful smooth base for polish and finish with Liquid Glass. Just because it says LAMINATE doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s permanent,as it will be removed with polish remover. Also see Never Break laminate.  Not as hard as laminate worktop but nearly!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I&#x27;m actually ordering two this time around.   I&#x27;ve been a nail biter very since i was a kid, and it wasnt untill recently that i stopped. However, my nails kept breaking from the corners (I like my nails square) and i put this on, and my nails are longer then my moms now!     for the first two weeks, i put on my entire nail,and now, for extra protection, i put it on, and under my nails too!     Buy it!!! you wont regret it.</li>
            <li> As a guitarist I find it a constant challenge to keep my nails in optimum condition. Broken, chipped,cracked, and splitting nails are a hindrance to accurate fretwork,there sill strength required to carry out the expressive attack,essential to an exciting performance.&lt;br /&gt;  Your product,while very attractive and easy to apply could not sustain the durable protection I had hoped for.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the problem does not lie with No More Wraps but is due to the fact that I have a calcium deficiency.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used to help \\&quot;mend\\&quot; a split or weak fingernail! It is Toluene and Formaldehyde FREE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep my nails a medium length and I love nail polish, but I have a pesky vertical weak spot in one of my fingers that will \\&quot;split\\&quot; as it grows out to the free edge of the nail. I&#x27;ve tried everything to get the vertical groove to disappear (supplements galore!), but it remains. I&#x27;ve had it now for about 6 years. Without this product, I&#x27;d have to keep my nails filed super short to avoid the split going deep --- OUCH! (you can&#x27;t have 9 long nails and one short 1! lol). I used to use nail wrap silk papers, but ugh..what a pain in the you-know-what! The filing/buffing, the papers, the GLUE, more buffing, then smoothing, and on and on. And as soon as I used a cuticle oil or hand creme -- it was all over -- the wrap would \\&quot;lift\\&quot; after a few days&#x27; and I&#x27;d have to start all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It beats trying to work with traditional \\&quot;silk wraps\\&quot;. NO glue, NO paper, no worry about cuticle oils lifting off the wrap. Just apply (following product directions!) as you would a nail polish, to clean dry nails. The directions clearly state to use 1-2 coats of No More Wraps, and allow to dry between coats. Then, apply nail polish -- this is in the directions! I mention this because I feel the person who gave this product only 2 stars, did not write a fair review. It seems they used No More Wraps as a stand-alone product, and that is not the correct useage of the product. You must seal it with nail polish (use clear, if you don&#x27;t want a color!), and then you must follow up with a topcoat. That is the correct way to use this product. I feel that when people do not use a product correctly, and then post a bad review, that really hurts those of us who are truly looking to reviews to help us decide on a purchase.  This is a super super product and I have used it for YEARS.&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, please be realistic about what this product can and cannot do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will it mend a small split in a nail or strengthen weak, thin, and/or ridged nails? YES.&lt;br /&gt;Will it repair/mend a completely \\&quot;chipped OFF\\&quot; piece of a fingernail? I highly doubt it, though I haven&#x27;t tried. Good luck getting even silk wraps or nail glue to do that (works for a day, if that, for a large split -- doubt it would stick back on a chipped off piece of nail though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP:&lt;br /&gt;The best way to make any nail polish adhere is to lightly file the surface of the nail; HOWEVER, if you have thin or splitting nails to begin with -- this is not something you should do. What you CAN do, however, is to wash your nails with soapy water and a nail brush. Dry with a paper towel. Then, use some rubbing alcohol on the nails to remove any/all traces of oils, etc. Dry nails off. Then begin application of No More Wraps, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to brush your nail products over the free edge of your nail. And be realistic -- if you are constantly running your hands under water (as I am, washing dishes, bathing my puppy, washing my hair, gardening, etc), then use rubber gloves. Any manicure will get destroyed if you do not apply your products correctly, as well as if you are harsh on your nails/hands. Using a daily cuticle oil application (ie Solar Oil, etc) is also a good idea. At the very least, use a hand creme daily. But MOST of all, read the product directions to ensure you get the most out of this wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I do not work for the company, nor do I have any vested interest in it...aside from hoping it will continue to be available for me to purchase for MANY decades to come. :D  ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Way of Applying No More Wraps:&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so here is the way I use the product. And btw, I use it on ALL my nails eventhough only one has the vertical split issue, since my nails tend to be weak over all (tend to tear easily from the side).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1- Wash nails with soapy water, using nail brush. Dry w/papertowel.&lt;br /&gt;2- Apply splash ofrubbing alcohol over nails. Air dry or wipe dry.&lt;br /&gt;3- Apply 1-2 coats of No More Wraps (I usually use 1 coat on non-split nails, and 2 coats on problem nail) Dry well between coats ...about 5 min between each of my nail product applications.&lt;br /&gt;4- Apply 2 coats of nail polish color. Again, let dry between coats -- esp in HOT humid weather.&lt;br /&gt;5- Apply topcoat (usually, I use Seche Vite rapid dry topcoat, but if I want REALLY shiney nails, I use Creative Nail Design \\&quot;Super Shiney\\&quot;! LUV this!! but it does take longer to dry. Allow a good 30 min if you use this topcoat!&lt;br /&gt;6- IF my nails are needing EXTRA EXTRA reinforcement (I do a lot of stuff with my hands around my house with my pets, as well as LOTS of typing for work, etc so I need extra help if I want to keep my nail length to grow past the free edge), I will use NAIL TEK II (or NAIL TEK XTRA) as a \\&quot;maintenance topcoat\\&quot; -- applied every other day. This won&#x27;t be as shiny as the CND \\&quot;Super Shiney\\&quot;, but it&#x27;s still shiney. Most of all...it will add super strength to the nail!  However, the Nail Tek product DOES have formaldehyde in it ....at least the XTRA does (not sure about the \\&quot;II\\&quot; formulation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:&lt;br /&gt;One coat of No More Wraps on my nails looks like a transluscent (NOT \\&quot;transparent\\&quot;) cover. You can still see your nailbed color through, but it has a slightly milky barely-there color to it. 2 coats will give you a pretty milky cover -- so I would not advise using only a clear np over 2 coats of No More Wraps -- it won&#x27;t look that attractive. If you need 2 coats of this product, use an actual nail polish \\&quot;color\\&quot; over it, and of course, always end with a top coat.  As a girl, this obviously is not an issue --- BUT if you are a guy needing to use this product, you can use 1 coat of No More Wraps, followed by OPI clear nail polish for Men -- it is a MATTE formula, so it is clear, but not with a girly \\&quot;shine\\&quot; to it. I forget the name of this OPI product, but I am sure you can find it on the OPIweb site. Call and ask them about it.  Not sure what you would do for a topcoat, though? Ask OPI to see if they make a matte topcoat as well? Or perhaps another brand does. Google it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;____________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review will help those seeking to find a great EASY way to help mend a weak/split nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Everything!&lt;br /&gt;Cons: WHY doesn&#x27;t Sally Beauty Supply or ULTA carry this product? Sometimes you need to mend a nail \\&quot;right away\\&quot;, not in 5+ days after ordering online. I now buy the 3-pack off of Amazon, just to make sure I am never without it.</li>
            <li> I my nail polish last longer without this under neath. I basically never use it, so it was a waste of money</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVED this product! It did exactly what it says it does and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it!</li>
            <li> This works great as a nail hardener while you are trying to grow out split nails.  Looks good as a sheer polish too. Just follow with a top coat.  Ships really fast too, so you you dont&#x27;t have to wait long for it to arrive.</li>
            <li> I have used it before but could not find it in any of our stores.  I have very thin nails due to medication and this No More&lt;br /&gt;Wraps protects them better than anything else I have tried.  They are very weak especially at the ends.  I&#x27;ve tried hardners,&lt;br /&gt;etc., but sometimes I feel they make my nails worse.  Was very happy that I found it thru Amazon.</li>
            <li> I thought it would make my nails stronger....It is no better than ordinary nail polish...not what I wanted or expected....would not recommend</li>
            <li> Thus far Great product ... Will be ordering very soon. I applied this product in thin layers, one coat on top of nail as well as under nail. Then nail Polish ...</li>
            <li> As I wrote about similar products I purchased, it just doesn&#x27;t deliver the advertised results. My recommendation: don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have tried to grow my nails out but never have been successful.  I bought this item at a grocery store but see better prices for it here on Amazon.  My nails will get so long then they break or split at the quick. I had given up on polishes because I would put them on and even with a under coat and top coat I would need to remove the polish by the next day.  I am really excited because I can put a dark color on and remove it with remover.  I and a group I belong to volunteer at a nursing home to paint the ladies fingernails.  We have a bad problem with getting the darker colors and sparkle polish off of their nails.  A lot of them have very brittle nails and they split and crack.  I am hoping to start this product on the upcoming trip to the nursing home.  I really like the way it feels when it is on it is so smooth.</li>
            <li> This item did not help at all with my splitting nails. I went back to doing my gel manicures at home.</li>
            <li> I have very long natural nails and I have been using this product for over 12 years.  It is great!&lt;br /&gt;My nails use to split at about half longer than my nail bed but after using this I can wear my nails&lt;br /&gt;about an inch long (this is past the finger tip)..</li>
            <li> Read the reviews. Was a little skeptical about this product, but my mind was changed when I used it.  The polish works really well. I have a broken nail that is really low and I got my nails gelled but it cracked where the nail tear is. I covered the gel with this and it has bonded well. Good product. Do recommend.</li>
            <li> After reading the review I was so disappointed.  Applied exactly as instructed.  Used 2 coats.  It gives your nails a whitish look.  I prefer clear as I don&#x27;t wear colored polish. So wasn&#x27;t happy about that.  Then followed with the never break laminate.  The No Wraps lifts and peels away.  Especially on the sides of my nails in big chunks.  No I didn&#x27;t apply it too thick. And I constantly use hand cream and wash dishes with gloves on,  I much prefer the Instant Artificials. It lasts a long time.  Is clear.  And is very durable.</li>
            <li> I have used it for years and swear by it. My nails are stronger and do not split or break when used religiously.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to rate a product that you haven&#x27;t used, so please disregard my rating and comments as I could not delete the stars after opening this page.</li>
            <li> Product did not meet my expectations, it did nothing for my nails.</li>
            <li> Putting two coats on your nails makes them look whitish.  I guess it&#x27;s best use would be as primer or undercoat for another preferred color.  Did not test how well another color adheres.</li>
