            <li>They work great on my hair</li>
            <li>I also noticed that it did not smell as good as the product that was used at the salon.  </li>

            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>This conditioner works better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>I used it once at my hair salon and fell in love with the results.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, I need to come u with 16 more words to say I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>So much better than many of the Pureology conditioners.  </li>
            <li>I just love Pureology products.  </li>
            <li>If you want the top product to repair your hair, nothing beats this.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never been better.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>so this makes it so much more healthy looking.</li>
            <li>Good deep conditioner, good brand.</li>
            <li>This is a great product; it makes your hair feel soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I colore once a month, so it&#x27;s easy to end up with parched looking hair.</li>
            <li>i have fine, curly aging and color treated hair.  </li>
            <li>very good moisturizer for my dry curly hair!</li>
            <li>I had several compliments on how great my hair looked after using this product.  </li>
            <li>I tried this once at my salon, so I was excited to try this product again.  </li>
            <li>It helps with dry ends and fly aways.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and makes your hair feel so feathery soft.  </li>
            <li>and I have been a loyal fan for years.  </li>
            <li>Looking at the ingredients, I figured that it must do something good for the hair, with all those good ingredients (various oils and such, and relatively pure).  </li>
            <li>but it last and most importantly</li>
            <li>...not as good as the other Pureology masques.</li>
            <li>I have thick curly hair that I tend to straighten alot, this puts moisture back into my hair and leaves it silky smooth and the conditioner smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine tried this to help her correct super frizz and damage from a perm, but she said it didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight, dry hair and this product makes it feel smooth and full.</li>
            <li>I am back for more.  </li>
            <li>Love all the pureology products but this not only protected the color but rehydrated.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Works best if left on hair for at least 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>This masque is more intense and that is why I use it only once a week and before every color treatment.  </li>
            <li>I have only used this a couple of times but this works very well and is very concentrated as most of the Pureology line</li>
            <li>so deep conditioners can make my hair look super greasy if I don&#x27;t use the right product.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair smooth and shiny but not flat.</li>
            <li>Very good product; Would give it 5 stars if it were not so expensive.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>I can only wash my hair about 1 time a week due to the bright color</li>
            <li>my review is for this particular Hydrate Optimum Moisture Hair Masque, as opposed to the Hydrate regular conditioner or other types of Pureology products.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s only one way to know if something will work, I guess.of mine tried this to help her correct super frizz and damage from a perm, but she said it didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, my hair felt soft and flexible again.</li>
            <li>also want to point out that the effect this has for you may have to do with what your particular problem is.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to anyone (particularly those of us with color treated hair) to use.</li>
            <li>Now that I get high lights</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommended to anyone with damaged/dry hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other Pureology products, but it is this one that had the strong effect that</li>
            <li>Needless to say I just ordered another jar of this great conditioner.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and silky too.</li>
            <li>It really helps add the extra softness and shine!</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair so soft, silky &amp; shiny...</li>
            <li>I hope I didn&#x27;t get scammed, but I&#x27;m pretty sure this was a fake.</li>
            <li>I used as little as possible to get the effect of it (but still more than someone with short hair), so it lasted a long time for me.</li>
            <li>I had changed hair dyes, and over time, it turned my once healthy, shiny hair into a dry, dull lifeless mass.</li>
            <li>A few years ago I had gotten my long fine, straight, medium brown dyed hair in a mess.</li>

            <li> It leaves my hair soft and silky feeling without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I have dry, color treated hair.</li>
            <li> , I blow dry and my hair is so shiny .</li>
            <li> Therefore, my hair tends to be slightly dry.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I had a small box FULL of shampoos and conditioners and treatments.</li>
            <li> As with all their products, a tiny amount goes a long way, so don&#x27;t waste it slathering it on.</li>
            <li> Not only did it feel stiff and sort of crunchy, I couldn&#x27;t get it to shine for anything, even with all those silk serums and shine serums.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but I only need a small amount for my shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure my hair was actually &amp;#34;damaged,&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Only downer is it is expensive, use only a little(it goes a long ways) use on the ends of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> Left it for 15 minutes then rinsed out my hair and dried as usual.  </li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t return completely to normal, of course, since it had been altered by the awful hair dye product, but it was at least healthier and much more manageable.</li>
            <li> It just takes a little bit each time, so in the end it probably really isn&#x27;t all that expensive.</li>
            <li> I tried it and it just felt heavy and weighed down my hair and dried it out...</li>
            <li> During the summer I did the ombre look with bleached ends, and in turn it killed all the moisture I had in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I washed and conditioned my hair as usual, placed this on towel dried hair, then wrapped a damp heated towel around my hair.  </li>
            <li> Use this often, but it didn&#x27;t feel or smell like usual.</li>
            <li> Pureology hair masque works well for my thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair that is color-treated.</li>
            <li> So even though it was expensive, it lasted longer than other conditioners and did help restore the health of my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick with some wave and is color treated (base and high lights).  </li>
            <li> I went through a jar of this and then decided to try something less expensive.</li>
            <li> Mine was the yukkiness, dryness, dullness, and general unhealthy look of my hair from a bad hair dye product.  </li>
            <li> Had a horrible smell, not sure if it was extremely old or an imposter brand.</li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> so it may be expensive</li>
            <li> Nothing was working, and I was desperate to find ANYTHING that would help without over doing it.  </li>
            <li> Being a frugal person, I balked at the price of this conditioner, but since I was desperate, I sprung for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I like this hair Cinditioner; you rinse out after about 10 minutes or so.</li>
            <li> Expensive but I only need a small amount for my shoulder length hair. Leaves my hair smooth and shiny but not flat.</li>
            <li> Pureology hair masque works well for my thick hair.  The smell is good; I wish they would make the smell more enticing, like their purple bottled shampoo.</li>
            <li> Had a horrible smell, not sure if it was extremely old or an imposter brand. Had to return it. Use this often, but it didn&#x27;t feel or smell like usual. I actually made my hair stink</li>
            <li> ...not as good as the other Pureology masques.</li>
            <li> I have dry, color treated hair. I colore once a month, so it&#x27;s easy to end up with parched looking hair. This conditioner works better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried. It leaves my hair soft and silky feeling without weighing it down. I went through a jar of this and then decided to try something less expensive. Big mistake! Needless to say I just ordered another jar of this great conditioner. It just takes a little bit each time, so in the end it probably really isn&#x27;t all that expensive.</li>
            <li> I tried this once at my salon, so I was excited to try this product again.  When I got it, I noticed the packaging was damaged (no big deal).  I also noticed that it did not smell as good as the product that was used at the salon.  I tried it and it just felt heavy and weighed down my hair and dried it out...nothing like the salon product results.  I&#x27;m very disappointed.  I hope I didn&#x27;t get scammed, but I&#x27;m pretty sure this was a fake.</li>
            <li> I love this hair treatment! I used it once at my hair salon and fell in love with the results. I have thick curly hair that I tend to straighten alot, this puts moisture back into my hair and leaves it silky smooth and the conditioner smells wonderful. I also use the pureology hydrate shampoo and conditioner faithfully and it&#x27;s restoring my hair and helping it grow faster!!! I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I need to come u with 16 more words to say I love this stuff. It&#x27;s 2:54 am. How about just.. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is a great product; it makes your hair feel soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I have only used this a couple of times but this works very well and is very concentrated as most of the Pureology line so it may be expensive but it last and most importantly .. It works.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the product and will be re-ordering soon. Terrific prices!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  I thought I would have to keep it on for a while but even after I washed my hair and added the conditioner I could tell that the difference immediately.  I&#x27;ll be using this from now on.</li>
            <li> Very good product; Would give it 5 stars if it were not so expensive. Works best if left on hair for at least 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Great product, I is this every three or four days.  I wash my hair then use this product (leave in five minutes) wash out and my hair looks great, I blow dry and my hair is so shiny . Only downer is it is expensive, use only a little(it goes a long ways) use on the ends of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Love this !!</li>
            <li> Monica, my hairdresser in Banning, uses this so I ordered it. Love it. I highlight my hair and this does not strip color. The Pureology brand is great for colored hair.</li>
            <li> i have fine, curly aging and color treated hair.  this stuff makes it look and feel like my hair did in my 20&#x27;s.  I am back for more.  Love all the pureology products but this not only protected the color but rehydrated.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! So much better than many of the Pureology conditioners.  It smells nice and makes your hair feel so feathery soft.  I would highly recommend to anyone (particularly those of us with color treated hair) to use.</li>
            <li> I just love Pureology products.  They work great on my hair and I have been a loyal fan for years.  My hair is thick with some wave and is color treated (base and high lights).  I use this product the day before I get my hair colored to give it that extra conditioning it needs.  Now that I get high lights my hair texture has changed and with the weather getting colder I also use it once a week to replenish the moisture.  I use the Pureology Hydrate line for shampoo and every day conditioner.  This masque is more intense and that is why I use it only once a week and before every color treatment.  It makes my hair so soft and silky too.</li>
            <li> If you want the top product to repair your hair, nothing beats this. As with all their products, a tiny amount goes a long way, so don&#x27;t waste it slathering it on. I only use it one a week or so and oh the softness and shine!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  My hair has never been better.  I use it every time I wash my hair.  It helps with dry ends and fly aways.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is amazing. I have thick hair that is color-treated. Therefore, my hair tends to be slightly dry. I use this conditioner once a week and it makes my hair feel wonderful- full of moisture and shiny. I would recommend this product to anyone!!</li>
            <li> The best stuff ever!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this conditioner.  During the summer I did the ombre look with bleached ends, and in turn it killed all the moisture I had in my hair.  Nothing was working, and I was desperate to find ANYTHING that would help without over doing it.  I have very fine hair so deep conditioners can make my hair look super greasy if I don&#x27;t use the right product.  This conditioner is the only thing that helped... 6 months later and I&#x27;m still happily using it!!  HIGHLY recommended to anyone with damaged/dry hair.</li>
            <li> I can only wash my hair about 1 time a week due to the bright color so i use this every time. It really helps add the extra softness and shine!</li>
            <li> I am on my second jar of this moisturizer.  It leaves my hair so soft, silky &amp; shiny... Since I wash my hair about every third day I use it each time.  My hair is colored so this makes it so much more healthy looking.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I had gotten my long fine, straight, medium brown dyed hair in a mess. I had changed hair dyes, and over time, it turned my once healthy, shiny hair into a dry, dull lifeless mass. Not only did it feel stiff and sort of crunchy, I couldn&#x27;t get it to shine for anything, even with all those silk serums and shine serums. I tried all sorts of conditioners. Seriously, I had a small box FULL of shampoos and conditioners and treatments. Being a frugal person, I balked at the price of this conditioner, but since I was desperate, I sprung for it. Looking at the ingredients, I figured that it must do something good for the hair, with all those good ingredients (various oils and such, and relatively pure).  Well, let me tell you....miracle in a jar! The first time I tried it, my hair felt soft and flexible again. There was also a bit of shine. As I continued to use it, the life came back to my hair. My hair didn&#x27;t return completely to normal, of course, since it had been altered by the awful hair dye product, but it was at least healthier and much more manageable. I used as little as possible to get the effect of it (but still more than someone with short hair), so it lasted a long time for me. I used it a couple of times every week. It lasted for months. So even though it was expensive, it lasted longer than other conditioners and did help restore the health of my hair.  (Note: my review is for this particular Hydrate Optimum Moisture Hair Masque, as opposed to the Hydrate regular conditioner or other types of Pureology products.  Each one is different. I&#x27;ve tried other Pureology products, but it is this one that had the strong effect that I needed.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to point out that the effect this has for you may have to do with what your particular problem is. Mine was the yukkiness, dryness, dullness, and general unhealthy look of my hair from a bad hair dye product.  I&#x27;m not sure my hair was actually &amp;#34;damaged,&amp;#34; if that makes sense. A friend of mine tried this to help her correct super frizz and damage from a perm, but she said it didn&#x27;t help much. Everything is very individual. There&#x27;s only one way to know if something will work, I guess.of mine tried this to help her correct super frizz and damage from a perm, but she said it didn&#x27;t help much.

            <li> Good deep conditioner, good brand.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome</li>
            <li> Worked great!  I had several compliments on how great my hair looked after using this product.  I did not follow the directions.  I washed and conditioned my hair as usual, placed this on towel dried hair, then wrapped a damp heated towel around my hair.  Left it for 15 minutes then rinsed out my hair and dried as usual.  Exactly what I was looking for.  Will probably do that once a week.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> very good moisturizer for my dry curly hair! I&#x27;ve been using it once a week. Smells great also! would purchase again!</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight, dry hair and this product makes it feel smooth and full. Styles hold well.</li>
