            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind waiting, this is a good deal.</li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t LOVE it (because I would like the colors to be brighter on my skin) but its great for the price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>I love all the colors and am happy with the product.</li>
            <li>I love the colors and it is a great value for what I received.  </li>
            <li>They are good on their own, or I blend them together.</li>
            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I am in love!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;Try this!</li>
            <li>The quality is great and blends fine.</li>
            <li>This is amazing, i was screaming when i saw it in the mail.</li>
            <li>so I had to kind of rip the box</li>
            <li>The colors are really nice</li>
            <li>is really nice and Iove the case</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to people on more of a budget wanting good makeup.</li>
            <li>it arrived she was thrilled.</li>
            <li>But it is a really nice palette.</li>
            <li>I love the colors best make up, but you do have to work at the colors to get them to blend the right way</li>
            <li>The shades smooth on very nicely.</li>
            <li>and the brush is way nice I love it</li>
            <li>Originally I though this was a good bargain.</li>
            <li>I give this a five star for giving me such great quality and great price.</li>
            <li>I love love love love it!</li>
            <li>The packaging was great also very protective !</li>
            <li>Although not an exact copy, she was perfectly happy with this.  </li>
            <li>That being said, the colors are BEAUTIFUL, and the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>But the colors are good, so for the price it was worth it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the colors and I love how it makes my eyes pop when I put it on the brush</li>
            <li>It has more of bronzish tones to it, but it looks flattering on everyone.</li>
            <li>but it is actually Urban Decay and came well wrapped... its perfect.  </li>
            <li>My granddaughter was so pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li>What could be better than that?</li>
            <li>Love the colors.</li>
            <li>Love the packaging.</li>
            <li>Love everything about this.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite makeup products in my collection.</li>
            <li>Overall great palette though!</li>
            <li>I love the eye shadow</li>
            <li>I just love it</li>
            <li>So Im in love with this product.</li>
            <li>Im also in love with the price.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Not that I&#x27;ve ever purchased a Naked palette before, but it&#x27;s wonderful for a knock-off!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m okay with that trade-off.</li>
            <li>but once I opended the package I couldn&#x27;t be more happier with my purchase</li>
            <li>I love the neutral colors.</li>
            <li>but with more affordable prices.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>The mirror in the case was all scratched &amp; foggy, but another than that I love the colors.</li>
            <li>Such great colors!!!</li>
            <li>Absolutely in love with this make up palette</li>
            <li>Was a gift and it is a favorite</li>
            <li>Naked 2 palette, I love it!!!</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good knock off.  </li>
            <li>The brush that came with the palette is so soft, easy to clean, and applies the eyeshadow wonderfully!</li>
            <li>I thought I was getting the original palette, NOT!</li>
            <li>What a great price for the amazing naked palette.</li>
            <li>Could of been more secure in the shipping</li>
            <li>Loved it so much I ordered 2</li>
            <li>The brush is good for blending but not so much applying.</li>
            <li>I feel like i got more than my monies worth!</li>
            <li>It arrive on time, before the due date and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>I find that they stay on fine and blend well.</li>
            <li>It looks exactly like urban decay, I couldn&#x27;t ask for better!!!!</li>
            <li>Thank you seller for this opportunity and quick shipping!</li>
            <li>The makeup is amazing and works really well..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for all day use and the colors do not fade, especially when I use a shadow primer.  </li>
            <li>As far as how the palette actually works its okay not the best, i suggest using eye shadow premier.</li>
            <li>It was worth it for the 12$, but not a penny more.</li>
            <li>it was a naked palette and its amazing, it has great pigment and came with no scratches, no broken eye shadows or anything.</li>
            <li>Its worth more than I paid for it.</li>
            <li>I got it cheap</li>
            <li>I took it into an Ulta and they confirmed it for me.</li>
            <li>the brush is really nice also and it says urban decay naked2 on it which is nice.</li>
            <li>Seem to last as good as most eye shadows.</li>
            <li>They may not be the quality of Urban Decay but they are still a good quality and I am glad that I bought this palette.</li>
            <li>I have an authentic Urban Decay Naked3 pallet and this one feels and looks as good as the original.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t what I originally ordered it ended up being a phone case instead of the eyeshadow that I ordered</li>
            <li>Product was described great, just wish it didn&#x27;t take so long to delivered.</li>
            <li>And it was $10, versus $50 for the original.</li>
            <li>and shes pretty sure</li>
            <li>Worth the buy!</li>
            <li>I love it so much!  </li>
            <li>This came much faster than the expected delivery date, which is awesome.  </li>
            <li>but most of the other colors were good</li>
            <li>I really like this eyeshadow palette, it has beautiful shades and it comes with a double sided brush.</li>
            <li>I would have been better off with buying the real one from Sephora.</li>
            <li>Well if this is a knock off they did a really good job because it came with the brush and urban decay lip gloss.</li>
            <li>I ordered matte finish and the compact is full of shimmer</li>
            <li>; when it came in the mail (I was only looking for a neutral palette with good ratings).</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>I am always weary of a deal that is too good to be true but this one actually paid off.  </li>
            <li>and I knew it wouldn&#x27;t be exactly the urban decay, but it&#x27;s pretty close and a really good eyeshadow pallette!</li>
            <li>BLOWN AWAY to receive the real product, and all the quality that goes along with the original!</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and intact.  </li>
            <li>was worth it due to the quality of the brand and the great price.</li>
            <li>This was my very first eyeshadow palette.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much for the opportunity to purchase this product from you!</li>
            <li>Very pretty on my skin tone</li>
            <li>I was very surprised and pleased.</li>
            <li>but all around doesn&#x27;t work very effectively and not worth the money even for a knock off version</li>
            <li>Overall, pleased with the product and price!</li>
            <li>its the real thing which makes it a steal considering its like a $50 palette!!</li>
            <li>Came fast and everything was intact!!</li>
            <li>The price seems to good to be true because it is, this is nothing but a cheap, unsafe knock off, and I&#x27;m honesty surprised that Amazon has not taken counterfeit products such as this off their website.</li>
            <li>Overall its a nice palette.</li>
            <li>but when they arrived they were in perfect shape nothing broken.  </li>
            <li>So far, my sister and I are pleased.</li>
            <li>It is in a quality case and honestly, if you didn&#x27;t know the difference you would not know this is not made by Urban Decay.  </li>
            <li>Great shipping, soft colors and double tipped brush and also stays on all day!</li>
            <li>The colors are nice, and the product arrived two weeks earlier than posted.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what was described and is the true Naked2.</li>
            <li>I prefer the original Naked palette because I like the colors a bit better, but that is just my preference.  </li>
            <li>, I got on for my sister and I, both came quickly, undamaged and were the real deal!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a quality neutral palette without paying a ton of money!!!</li>
            <li>I love urban decay so to get the naked 2 palette at this price was amazing.</li>
            <li>This eye shadow pallet is absolutely amazing the colors are so vibrant and they last literaly</li>
            <li>This make up works pretty good but the coloring seems a little off.</li>
            <li>First off this was suppose to come thru january 23-feburary 10</li>
            <li>.this is an exact replica of the naked2 palette</li>
            <li>It goes with a lot the outfits I have and blends really well!</li>
            <li>And didnt have to pay over 50 bucks or 100 since I ended up getting 2, absolutely recommend!</li>
            <li>It came incredibly fast and it&#x27;s worth the buy.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what she wanted.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t willing to pay the x4 price</li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t distinguish the difference in this one and the higher priced one which she has used.</li>
            <li>so I give this product five stars ;-)</li>
            <li>the colors are so pretty and go on way well</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty.</li>
            <li>This may not be the real deal but for under $20.00 it is so worth it.</li>
            <li>People kept saying that this palette is a duplicate but is the real one!</li>
            <li>The real palette, the eye shadow stays on all day, this...you can&#x27;t even see the color when you put it on and comes off right away.</li>
            <li>So it honestly is still fine:) just a little messy for me at first and one of the browns is almost all gone.</li>
            <li>and I do enjoy the Naked palettes very much.</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant even without a primer!</li>
            <li>nice colors, you can use a little bit of primer to make it stay longer.</li>
            <li>But the colors are spot-on to the original, so if you use a little eye shadow primer beforehand, they work fine.</li>
            <li>The color payoff of the shadows is fantastic just like the real palette and same quality!</li>
            <li>I truly believe this is the real thing, but</li>
            <li>They go on smoothly and last well.  </li>
            <li>Bought for my daughter, because I was too cheap to buy the Naked 2 in the store.  </li>
            <li>Not knowing if it really is</li>
            <li>This palette is very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>It was not broken or damaged</li>
            <li>Everything looks real</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t spend to much for eye shadow.  </li>
            <li>The mirror was scratchy and blurry but I wouldn&#x27;t really use that mirror anyway</li>
            <li>I was expecting the real deal, they should make it known that it isnt real.</li>
            <li>but I was happily surprised it was authentic urban decay.  </li>
            <li>were all I. good condition except the mirror sucks.</li>
            <li>Although we own several of the Urban Decay brand, we thought we&#x27;d give it a try and compare.  </li>
            <li>AS AN INEXPENSIVE ALTERNATIVE TO THE ORIGINAL NAKED 2!!!</li>
            <li>Its an international order, so of course it took a while to get here but its so worth it!</li>
            <li>It has the exact same everything and it ships pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I have gotten way less for more money.</li>
            <li>Barely even shows plus if you blend the colors thay pretty much</li>
            <li>DO NOT PAY MORE THAN $52 on any of the Urban Decay Naked Palettes.  </li>
            <li>I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend i t.</li>
            <li>My package came with a tin case with &amp;#34;NAKED 2 by Urban Decay&amp;#34; on it (as shown in the picture) with all eye shadows intact with the exact naming as the original NAKED 2.</li>
            <li>I love it and use it everyday.</li>
            <li>I love the eye shadow but 1 of them was missing part of the color.</li>
            <li>You can use it everyday for so many looks.</li>
            <li>Other than that eyeshadows were in great condition and I recieved it earlier then expected.</li>
            <li>Came in perfect condition and as a bonus it came a least week earlier than expected !</li>
            <li>I expect \\&quot;new\\&quot; to look new, not like a toddler threw it against a wall.</li>
            <li>The mirror is very foggy and not even a mirror barely!</li>
            <li>The only differences i see between this and the original NAKED 2, is the colors.</li>
            <li>and it is the exact same on it</li>
            <li>It is very pigment and it has the exact same colors as Urban Decay</li>
            <li>I expected this product to look completely different than the original since it isn&#x27;t, but when it arrived, it looks exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>I was so happy to get it only to realize its a fake product.</li>
            <li>16 year old daughter ordered this.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal Urban Decay</li>
            <li>Next time I will go ahead and splurge on the real thing</li>
            <li>Fast enough for me!</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see the box and case</li>
            <li>We were both pleasantly surprised to the quality and pigment in each shade.  </li>
            <li>, however it cost as much to send it back as it did to purchase it</li>
            <li>fake so its not as good of quality.</li>
            <li>They colors are similar, but not the exact same</li>
            <li>I am ALMOST positive that this is the actual Naked 2 pallete!</li>
            <li>It stays on and blends well, but the colors just aren&#x27;t as vibrant as the actual Naked 2 pallet.  </li>
            <li>It even feels the same as far as I can tell.  </li>
            <li>Came much quicker than I expected too.</li>
            <li>When I got it there was a few shadows that were cracked but still useful.</li>
            <li>im sure people would still buy instead of finding out its rip-off.</li>
            <li>I was a little scared about ordering at first</li>
            <li>I received it in the mail yesterday and the eyeshadow powders have low pigment so the color barely shows up on your eyelids.</li>
            <li>Nice product but one of the colors was broken during shipment and made a mess in the package.</li>
            <li>Its good pigment but the only bad thing about it.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> The packaging is beautiful.</li>
            <li> the colors on the pallete are so beautiful and pigmented</li>
            <li> The pigment is good and they go on beautifully!</li>

            <li> Great deal</li>

            <li> The colors are great</li>
            <li> Great product</li>

            <li> I swatched the colors and the came off very nicely,</li>
            <li> Everything about the pallete was amazing!</li>

            <li> If you still don&#x27;t own it, it&#x27;s time you did!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very excited, this is a great eyeshadow palette!</li>
            <li> This is so worth the buy!!!!</li>
            <li> The colors are gorgeous.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind waiting, this is a good deal.</li>
            <li> I loved it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t LOVE it (because I would like the colors to be brighter on my skin) but its great for the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I love all the colors and am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and it is a great value for what I received.  </li>
            <li> They are good on their own, or I blend them together.</li>
            <li> I love them!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I am in love!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> :)&lt;br /&gt;Try this!</li>
            <li> The quality is great and blends fine.</li>
            <li> This is amazing, i was screaming when i saw it in the mail.</li>
            <li> so I had to kind of rip the box</li>
            <li> The colors are really nice</li>
            <li> is really nice and Iove the case</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to people on more of a budget wanting good makeup.</li>
            <li> it arrived she was thrilled.</li>
            <li> But it is a really nice palette.</li>
            <li> I love the colors best make up, but you do have to work at the colors to get them to blend the right way</li>
            <li> The shades smooth on very nicely.</li>
            <li> and the brush is way nice I love it</li>
            <li> Originally I though this was a good bargain.</li>
            <li> I give this a five star for giving me such great quality and great price.</li>
            <li> I love love love love it!</li>
            <li> The packaging was great also very protective !</li>
            <li> Although not an exact copy, she was perfectly happy with this.  </li>
            <li> That being said, the colors are BEAUTIFUL, and the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> But the colors are good, so for the price it was worth it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and I love how it makes my eyes pop when I put it on the brush</li>
            <li> It has more of bronzish tones to it, but it looks flattering on everyone.</li>
            <li> but it is actually Urban Decay and came well wrapped... its perfect.  </li>
            <li> My granddaughter was so pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li> What could be better than that?</li>
            <li> Love the colors.</li>
            <li> Love the packaging.</li>
            <li> Love everything about this.  </li>
            <li> One of my favorite makeup products in my collection.</li>
            <li> Overall great palette though!</li>
            <li> I love the eye shadow</li>
            <li> I just love it</li>
            <li> So Im in love with this product.</li>
            <li> Im also in love with the price.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Not that I&#x27;ve ever purchased a Naked palette before, but it&#x27;s wonderful for a knock-off!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m okay with that trade-off.</li>
            <li> but once I opended the package I couldn&#x27;t be more happier with my purchase</li>
            <li> I love the neutral colors.</li>
            <li> but with more affordable prices.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> The mirror in the case was all scratched &amp; foggy, but another than that I love the colors.</li>
            <li> Such great colors!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely in love with this make up palette</li>
            <li> Was a gift and it is a favorite</li>
            <li> Naked 2 palette, I love it!!!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good knock off.  </li>
            <li> The brush that came with the palette is so soft, easy to clean, and applies the eyeshadow wonderfully!</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting the original palette, NOT!</li>
            <li> What a great price for the amazing naked palette.</li>
            <li> Could of been more secure in the shipping</li>
            <li> Loved it so much I ordered 2</li>
            <li> The brush is good for blending but not so much applying.</li>
            <li> I feel like i got more than my monies worth!</li>
            <li> It arrive on time, before the due date and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> I find that they stay on fine and blend well.</li>
            <li> It looks exactly like urban decay, I couldn&#x27;t ask for better!!!!</li>
            <li> Thank you seller for this opportunity and quick shipping!</li>
            <li> The makeup is amazing and works really well..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for all day use and the colors do not fade, especially when I use a shadow primer.  </li>
            <li> As far as how the palette actually works its okay not the best, i suggest using eye shadow premier.</li>
            <li> It was worth it for the 12$, but not a penny more.</li>
            <li> it was a naked palette and its amazing, it has great pigment and came with no scratches, no broken eye shadows or anything.</li>
            <li> Its worth more than I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I got it cheap</li>
            <li> I took it into an Ulta and they confirmed it for me.</li>
            <li> the brush is really nice also and it says urban decay naked2 on it which is nice.</li>
            <li> Seem to last as good as most eye shadows.</li>
            <li> They may not be the quality of Urban Decay but they are still a good quality and I am glad that I bought this palette.</li>
            <li> I have an authentic Urban Decay Naked3 pallet and this one feels and looks as good as the original.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I originally ordered it ended up being a phone case instead of the eyeshadow that I ordered</li>
            <li> Product was described great, just wish it didn&#x27;t take so long to delivered.</li>
            <li> And it was $10, versus $50 for the original.</li>
            <li> and shes pretty sure</li>
            <li> Worth the buy!</li>
            <li> I love it so much!  </li>
            <li> This came much faster than the expected delivery date, which is awesome.  </li>
            <li> but most of the other colors were good</li>
            <li> I really like this eyeshadow palette, it has beautiful shades and it comes with a double sided brush.</li>
            <li> I would have been better off with buying the real one from Sephora.</li>
            <li> Well if this is a knock off they did a really good job because it came with the brush and urban decay lip gloss.</li>
            <li> I ordered matte finish and the compact is full of shimmer</li>
            <li> ; when it came in the mail (I was only looking for a neutral palette with good ratings).</li>
            <li> I love it so much</li>
            <li> I am always weary of a deal that is too good to be true but this one actually paid off.  </li>
            <li> and I knew it wouldn&#x27;t be exactly the urban decay, but it&#x27;s pretty close and a really good eyeshadow pallette!</li>
            <li> BLOWN AWAY to receive the real product, and all the quality that goes along with the original!</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and intact.  </li>
            <li> was worth it due to the quality of the brand and the great price.</li>
            <li> This was my very first eyeshadow palette.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much for the opportunity to purchase this product from you!</li>
            <li> Very pretty on my skin tone</li>
            <li> I was very surprised and pleased.</li>
            <li> but all around doesn&#x27;t work very effectively and not worth the money even for a knock off version</li>
            <li> Overall, pleased with the product and price!</li>
            <li> its the real thing which makes it a steal considering its like a $50 palette!!</li>
            <li> Came fast and everything was intact!!</li>
            <li> The price seems to good to be true because it is, this is nothing but a cheap, unsafe knock off, and I&#x27;m honesty surprised that Amazon has not taken counterfeit products such as this off their website.</li>
            <li> Overall its a nice palette.</li>
            <li> but when they arrived they were in perfect shape nothing broken.  </li>
            <li> So far, my sister and I are pleased.</li>
            <li> It is in a quality case and honestly, if you didn&#x27;t know the difference you would not know this is not made by Urban Decay.  </li>
            <li> Great shipping, soft colors and double tipped brush and also stays on all day!</li>
            <li> The colors are nice, and the product arrived two weeks earlier than posted.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what was described and is the true Naked2.</li>
            <li> I prefer the original Naked palette because I like the colors a bit better, but that is just my preference.  </li>
            <li> , I got on for my sister and I, both came quickly, undamaged and were the real deal!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a quality neutral palette without paying a ton of money!!!</li>
            <li> I love urban decay so to get the naked 2 palette at this price was amazing.</li>
            <li> This eye shadow pallet is absolutely amazing the colors are so vibrant and they last literaly</li>
            <li> This make up works pretty good but the coloring seems a little off.</li>
            <li> First off this was suppose to come thru january 23-feburary 10</li>
            <li> .this is an exact replica of the naked2 palette</li>
            <li> It goes with a lot the outfits I have and blends really well!</li>
            <li> And didnt have to pay over 50 bucks or 100 since I ended up getting 2, absolutely recommend!</li>
            <li> It came incredibly fast and it&#x27;s worth the buy.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what she wanted.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t willing to pay the x4 price</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t distinguish the difference in this one and the higher priced one which she has used.</li>
            <li> so I give this product five stars ;-)</li>
            <li> the colors are so pretty and go on way well</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty.</li>
            <li> This may not be the real deal but for under $20.00 it is so worth it.</li>
            <li> People kept saying that this palette is a duplicate but is the real one!</li>
            <li> The real palette, the eye shadow stays on all day, this...you can&#x27;t even see the color when you put it on and comes off right away.</li>
            <li> So it honestly is still fine:) just a little messy for me at first and one of the browns is almost all gone.</li>
            <li> and I do enjoy the Naked palettes very much.</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant even without a primer!</li>
            <li> nice colors, you can use a little bit of primer to make it stay longer.</li>
            <li> But the colors are spot-on to the original, so if you use a little eye shadow primer beforehand, they work fine.</li>
            <li> The color payoff of the shadows is fantastic just like the real palette and same quality!</li>
            <li> I truly believe this is the real thing, but</li>
            <li> They go on smoothly and last well.  </li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter, because I was too cheap to buy the Naked 2 in the store.  </li>
            <li> Not knowing if it really is</li>
            <li> This palette is very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> It was not broken or damaged</li>
            <li> Everything looks real</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t spend to much for eye shadow.  </li>
            <li> The mirror was scratchy and blurry but I wouldn&#x27;t really use that mirror anyway</li>
            <li> I was expecting the real deal, they should make it known that it isnt real.</li>
            <li> but I was happily surprised it was authentic urban decay.  </li>
            <li> were all I. good condition except the mirror sucks.</li>
            <li> Although we own several of the Urban Decay brand, we thought we&#x27;d give it a try and compare.  </li>
            <li> AS AN INEXPENSIVE ALTERNATIVE TO THE ORIGINAL NAKED 2!!!</li>
            <li> Its an international order, so of course it took a while to get here but its so worth it!</li>
            <li> It has the exact same everything and it ships pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I have gotten way less for more money.</li>
            <li> Barely even shows plus if you blend the colors thay pretty much</li>
            <li> DO NOT PAY MORE THAN $52 on any of the Urban Decay Naked Palettes.  </li>
            <li> I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend i t.</li>
            <li> My package came with a tin case with &amp;#34;NAKED 2 by Urban Decay&amp;#34; on it (as shown in the picture) with all eye shadows intact with the exact naming as the original NAKED 2.</li>
            <li> I love it and use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I love the eye shadow but 1 of them was missing part of the color.</li>
            <li> You can use it everyday for so many looks.</li>
            <li> Other than that eyeshadows were in great condition and I recieved it earlier then expected.</li>
            <li> Came in perfect condition and as a bonus it came a least week earlier than expected !</li>
            <li> I expect \\&quot;new\\&quot; to look new, not like a toddler threw it against a wall.</li>
            <li> The mirror is very foggy and not even a mirror barely!</li>
            <li> The only differences i see between this and the original NAKED 2, is the colors.</li>
            <li> and it is the exact same on it</li>
            <li> It is very pigment and it has the exact same colors as Urban Decay</li>
            <li> I expected this product to look completely different than the original since it isn&#x27;t, but when it arrived, it looks exactly the same.  </li>
            <li> I was so happy to get it only to realize its a fake product.</li>
            <li> 16 year old daughter ordered this.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal Urban Decay</li>
            <li> Next time I will go ahead and splurge on the real thing</li>
            <li> Fast enough for me!</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see the box and case</li>
            <li> We were both pleasantly surprised to the quality and pigment in each shade.  </li>
            <li> , however it cost as much to send it back as it did to purchase it</li>
            <li> fake so its not as good of quality.</li>
            <li> They colors are similar, but not the exact same</li>
            <li> I am ALMOST positive that this is the actual Naked 2 pallete!</li>
            <li> It stays on and blends well, but the colors just aren&#x27;t as vibrant as the actual Naked 2 pallet.  </li>
            <li> It even feels the same as far as I can tell.  </li>
            <li> Came much quicker than I expected too.</li>
            <li> When I got it there was a few shadows that were cracked but still useful.</li>
            <li> im sure people would still buy instead of finding out its rip-off.</li>
            <li> I was a little scared about ordering at first</li>
            <li> I received it in the mail yesterday and the eyeshadow powders have low pigment so the color barely shows up on your eyelids.</li>
            <li> Nice product but one of the colors was broken during shipment and made a mess in the package.</li>
            <li> Its good pigment but the only bad thing about it.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my bff for Christmas and not only did it come a week and a half early</li>
            <li> It is the real deal no cheap knock off!</li>
            <li> Other than that no other complaints on my end.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this item if you are wanting the palette but unable to afford the original.</li>
            <li> Now if I want more of a vibrant look I could use a base.</li>
            <li> It was a fake, not the real version of the Urban Decay Naked 2 palette.</li>
            <li> It arrived Jan. 15 when expected Jan. 28 to Feb. 31.</li>
            <li> I know others have said the colors are not very pigmented</li>
            <li> It was all broken and only a tiny bit was left!</li>
            <li> this is not real.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected</li>
            <li> so I expected it to take longer</li>
            <li> Also a chunk was missing out of the third color.</li>
            <li> And it is shipped internationally, so may take a few weeks to arrive.</li>
            <li> all look the same color the black isn&#x27;t even black</li>
            <li> Other than that, I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s high quality and exactly what I was expecting, even though other negative reviews had me skeptical!</li>
            <li> maybe just an outdated design because I think the new ones aren&#x27;t metal.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is that a different delivery method should be chosen, one of my eye shadows was broken when I opened it.</li>
            <li> This is an imitation palette of a well known luxury makeup brand.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth it.</li>
            <li> Only downside--the delivery was quite slow.  </li>
            <li> BOO thumbs down.</li>
            <li> The black shadow was shattered.</li>
            <li> Was the black eyeshadow was not as pigmented as the rest.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s simply not true.  </li>
            <li> but the shadows are pigmented and I have little fall outs.</li>
            <li> I did have trouble getting the pallette out of the  box it came in</li>
            <li> I have been using it everyday.</li>
            <li> They should cost $52 or less!</li>
            <li> Got this product sooner than expected and nothing was broken inside.</li>
            <li> Since this item was fake, there is no indication of what your actually putting on your face.</li>
            <li> But when it arrived two of the colors had come completely out of tact and the mirror was extremely dirty.</li>
            <li> Why spend $52.00 when you can get it for less?!?!</li>
            <li> It was broken a little bit.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to use a base to help with the color to be vibrant at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter, but she refused it because she did some research on it and said that it is not good for your skin</li>
            <li> This make up sucks!</li>
            <li> In addition to this, the product wasn&#x27;t cracked or broken in any way.  </li>
            <li> I have never grown tired of it.</li>
            <li> The color that was broken was one of the prettiest of the palate.</li>
            <li> The eye shadow arrived and when it did all the colors were broken.</li>
            <li> and that it was a fake picture</li>
            <li> It it fake.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the fake ones to review on my youtube channel</li>
            <li> so my bestfriend is like obsessed with makeup</li>
            <li> This is FAKE.</li>
            <li> Its fake.  </li>

            <li> The colors are almost the same. There&#x27;s only 3 colors that are slightly different. I give this a five star for giving me such great quality and great price.</li>
            <li> This eyeshadow palette is extremely similar to NAKED2. My package came with a tin case with &amp;#34;NAKED 2 by Urban Decay&amp;#34; on it (as shown in the picture) with all eye shadows intact with the exact naming as the original NAKED 2. it also came with a 2 sided applying and blending brush with Urban Decay written on it... The quality is great and blends fine. Great for layering and blending. I didn&#x27;t see any difference in applying. The only differences i see between this and the original NAKED 2, is the colors. The colors are overall the same shade, but in this palette it may be tinted differently. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS AS AN INEXPENSIVE ALTERNATIVE TO THE ORIGINAL NAKED 2!!! Great Purchase!!!</li>
            <li> First off this was suppose to come thru january 23-feburary 10 and it arrived january 7th!  So that&#x27;s awesome! The packaging was great also very protective ! I did have trouble getting the pallette out of the  box it came in so I had to kind of rip the box .this is an exact replica of the naked2 palette the brush is really nice also and it says urban decay naked2 on it which is nice. The colors are really nice I love them! I would give this 5 stars but the mirror is really horrible so blurry its not even a mirror. Overall its a nice palette. Wish there was a naked3!</li>
            <li> This palette is beautiful! I love each and every color in it and it looks great on! It goes with a lot the outfits I have and blends really well!</li>
            <li> The makeup is amazing and works really well.. I love it and use it everyday. Best choice to get it here on Amazon</li>
            <li> Loved it so much I ordered 2, I got on for my sister and I, both came quickly, undamaged and were the real deal! NOT a knock off! I am so happy I found this! And didnt have to pay over 50 bucks or 100 since I ended up getting 2, absolutely recommend!</li>
            <li> The product was seemingly generic but I was happily surprised it was authentic urban decay.  The length of time waited too receive the product was worth it due to the quality of the brand and the great price.</li>
            <li> This came much faster than the expected delivery date, which is awesome.  In addition to this, the product wasn&#x27;t cracked or broken in any way.  The palette says Naked 2 on it, with Urban Decay branding.  I truly believe this is the real thing, but maybe just an outdated design because I think the new ones aren&#x27;t metal.  The colors are beautiful and stay on all day.  Would definitely buy again from this company!</li>
            <li> It was a fake, not the real version of the Urban Decay Naked 2 palette. But the colors are good, so for the price it was worth it.</li>
            <li> The shades were beautiful! !  This was a gift and the recipient was ecstatic when she saw them.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I got this for my bff for Christmas and not only did it come a week and a half early it was absolutely flawless. She loves it and its now her fave thing in the world. I think I&#x27;m going to buy one for myself now.</li>
            <li> Purchased this expecting a knock off product. BLOWN AWAY to receive the real product, and all the quality that goes along with the original! Ordered another for my daughter!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is amazing, i was screaming when i saw it in the mail. The packaging is beautiful. It&#x27;s not that pigmented, but you can definately build it up. The colors are gorgeous. It arrived Jan. 15 when expected Jan. 28 to Feb. 31. I love it. i reccomend to all. you can ask me questions about it in the comments</li>
            <li> What a great price for the amazing naked palette. It is the real deal no cheap knock off! Love it! My sister ended up buying one after seeing mine!</li>
            <li> I love the eye shadow but 1 of them was missing part of the color. It was broken a little bit.</li>
            <li> I love urban decay so to get the naked 2 palette at this price was amazing. The only thing is that a different delivery method should be chosen, one of my eye shadows was broken when I opened it.</li>
            <li> 16 year old daughter ordered this. She likes the color selections. Seem to last as good as most eye shadows. The product is made in China however so who knows about the animal testing.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 and 3 and they took awhile to get here but when they arrived they were in perfect shape nothing broken.  I am always weary of a deal that is too good to be true but this one actually paid off.  I have never even written a review before but I was so impressed with the cost of what I paid $11.99 versus the $50.00 at ULTA that I wanted to share.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and she loves it!  Excellent quality and price!  Next one I buy will be for me.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and I love how it makes my eyes pop when I put it on the brush is really nice and Iove the case it&#x27;s in</li>
            <li> In the picture, if you look closely, the brush says Naked2 on it which makes it seem like your getting the Naked2 palette. When it comes in, you find out that its not Naked2 and that it was a fake picture</li>
            <li> This is the NAKED2 palette. Don&#x27;t be fooled. It came incredibly fast and it&#x27;s worth the buy. I read some reviews before and I&#x27;ve noticed &amp;#34;scratched up mirror&amp;#34; being mentioned a lot. There is a plastic protector over the mirror, therefore the mirror is in perfect condition. THIS PRODUCT IS A MUST HAVE! Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Has the Naked II name on the box and on the brush inside.  It appears to indeed be the Urban Decay Naked II palette.  I prefer the original Naked palette because I like the colors a bit better, but that is just my preference.  Great deal and I do enjoy the Naked palettes very much.</li>
            <li> I expected this product to look completely different than the original since it isn&#x27;t, but when it arrived, it looks exactly the same.  It even feels the same as far as I can tell.  It&#x27;s a great price.  So far, my sister and I are pleased.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal Urban Decay Naked2 Palette and I am in love! It&#x27;s high quality and exactly what I was expecting, even though other negative reviews had me skeptical!</li>
            <li> This is not Urban Decay. It it fake.  The person that sales this should be kicked off the site for lieing about the product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  I know others have said the colors are not very pigmented but that&#x27;s simply not true.  I have an authentic Urban Decay Naked3 pallet and this one feels and looks as good as the original.  It is in a quality case and honestly, if you didn&#x27;t know the difference you would not know this is not made by Urban Decay.  The colors are wonderful and they are well pignmented.  They blend easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and buy this one.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I originally ordered it ended up being a phone case instead of the eyeshadow that I ordered</li>
            <li> This eye shadow pallet is absolutely amazing the colors are so vibrant and they last literaly all day I&#x27;m so happy I bought it</li>
            <li> I have been using this palette for a week now and I&#x27;m loving it. The packaging is falling a part but the shadows are pigmented and I have little fall outs. I would definitely recommend this item if you are wanting the palette but unable to afford the original.</li>
            <li> I bought this pallet hoping to save money instead of spending a lot on the actual naked2 pallet.. I would have been better off with buying the real one from Sephora. The black shadow was shattered. My mirror is scratched up. The metal has a bunch of chipped markings in it. The colors aren&#x27;t pigmented at all. It&#x27;s absolutely terrible. The ONLY upside was I received the pallet a week sooner than planned. Other than that, I would not recommend this to anyone. Definitely not worth it.</li>
            <li> This was my very first eyeshadow palette. I cannot imagine not having it! It is definitely a staple in terms of makeup. You can use it everyday for so many looks. I have never grown tired of it. It has more of bronzish tones to it, but it looks flattering on everyone. If you still don&#x27;t own it, it&#x27;s time you did!</li>
            <li> These colors are wonderful.  They go on smoothly and last well.  There are enough colors to go with just about everything.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a knock off from China when I ordered it and only paid $12.99 but it is actually Urban Decay and came well wrapped... its perfect.  Came much quicker than I expected too.</li>
            <li> Bootycall was shattered! I was disappointed. It was all broken and only a tiny bit was left! Extremely mad but most of the other colors were good</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good knock off.  It stays on and blends well, but the colors just aren&#x27;t as vibrant as the actual Naked 2 pallet.  Next time I will go ahead and splurge on the real thing but I&#x27;m happy to have this one for now.  I don&#x27;t LOVE it (because I would like the colors to be brighter on my skin) but its great for the price and I would definitely recommend it.  I have been using it everyday.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my teenage granddaughter. It was exactly what she wanted. It was showing that it would not be here before Christmas, but low and behold it can before. Great.</li>
            <li> The colors are great and so is the brush included with the kit.  It&#x27;s great for all day use and the colors do not fade, especially when I use a shadow primer.  Great product and I will recommend it to friends.  I will look to purchase another kit with different colors.  The kit was delivered with no damage.  I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
            <li> When I came across this I read all the reviews and noticed it said knock off. Well if this is a knock off they did a really good job because it came with the brush and urban decay lip gloss. I was very surprised and pleased. When I got it there was a few shadows that were cracked but still useful. I&#x27;m very pleased. Also the packaging is just like it would be if you bought it from sephora or ulta.</li>
            <li> This product is just like urban decays naked 2 palette. This is not Urban Decay though. They colors are similar, but not the exact same and the Tim is definitely cheaper quality. Got this product sooner than expected and nothing was broken inside. The brush is good for blending but not so much applying. The shades smooth on very nicely. I&#x27;ve already ordered one for my mom and I would definitely recommend this product to a friend or family member.</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter, because I was too cheap to buy the Naked 2 in the store.  Although not an exact copy, she was perfectly happy with this.  Only downside--the delivery was quite slow.  If you don&#x27;t mind waiting, this is a good deal.</li>
            <li> cons:&lt;br /&gt;its fake so its not as good of quality. the colors brush off when I blink my eyes, enough. you get what you payed for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros:&lt;br /&gt;came in about 2 weeks. nice colors, you can use a little bit of primer to make it stay longer. were all I. good condition except the mirror sucks.</li>
            <li> Now when I received this package my box says Urban Decay. Not knowing if it really is but I can say this... It can make you think it is!!! It is very pigment and it has the exact same colors as Urban Decay Naked 2 Palette!!! I&#x27;m a woman of color (caramel) and I don&#x27;t have to use a base to help with the color to be vibrant at all. Now if I want more of a vibrant look I could use a base. This palette is very inexpensive. Why spend $52.00 when you can get it for less?!?! Save your money and purchase this!!!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t willing to pay the x4 price but thought I would give this one a try.  My granddaughter was so pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;She couldn&#x27;t distinguish the difference in this one and the higher priced one which she has used.</li>
            <li> I loved it. It meets all my expectations! Thank you very much for the opportunity to purchase this product from you!</li>
            <li> Is the real naked 2 pallet for $12!! What could be better than that? Nothing! Because those sell in stores for like $60</li>
            <li> Love the colors. Love the packaging. Love everything about this.  Definitely need to purchase the third edition.  One of my favorite makeup products in my collection.</li>
            <li> This make up works pretty good but the coloring seems a little off. Overall great palette though! I would recommend to people on more of a budget wanting good makeup.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to get it only to realize its a fake product. But what else did I expect for $15. the colors are the same but aren&#x27;t as pigmented.</li>
            <li> I wanted this palette because every time I watch make up tutorials this seems to&lt;br /&gt;be the palette they are using. I love all the colors and am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> False Advertisement!!!! this is not real. Since this item was fake, there is no indication of what your actually putting on your face. As far as how the palette actually works its okay not the best, i suggest using eye shadow premier.</li>
            <li> I was never under any illusion that this would actually be Urban Decay 2.  It arrived quickly and intact.  I love the colors and it is a great value for what I received.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> CAUTION! DO NOT BUY! This is an imitation palette of a well known luxury makeup brand. A article from the FDA was released regarding these. They use harmful chemicals in the shadows that you ingest through your skin. Please Google it and read it for yourself! Originally I though this was a good bargain. After reading the disclosure I am horrified. If you have this palette discard it immediately!!</li>
            <li> I just received this palette today. The mirror is very foggy and not even a mirror barely! But I don&#x27;t use those tiny mirrors to put on makeup anyways so it&#x27;s definitely not a biggie. I swatched the colors and the came off very nicely, especially booty call!</li>
            <li> Nice product but one of the colors was broken during shipment and made a mess in the package. The color that was broken was one of the prettiest of the palate. Overall, pleased with the product and price! I use this daily and I will replace again.</li>
            <li> I have the real naked 1,2 and 3 I ordered the fake ones to review on my youtube channel I gave them to my mom they r so simpler she loves them</li>
            <li> Not the real naked 2 pallet. All of the colors popped out of the case holding. Not what I expected</li>
            <li> This has ALL the colors I use!  Great shipping, soft colors and double tipped brush and also stays on all day!</li>
            <li> I love the eye shadow but when I got it something must have happened during the shipment because a chunk of the eyeshadow broke and was everywhere. I was gonna return it but only had about 4 days so I just kept it and cleaned it up the best I could. So it honestly is still fine:) just a little messy for me at first and one of the browns is almost all gone.</li>
            <li> I ordered on 1/18  . I checked my updates and my package IS in my state and it&#x27;s been here since 2/2... My problem is that according to my tracker. It&#x27;d been in the same city and has not moved since then and today is 2/7 ... I understood thAt it&#x27;s coming from china so I expected it to take longer but what is the hold up?  I have no further updates since 2/2.  Slightly frustrated at this point .... I&#x27;ll update when it actually comes...</li>
            <li> The color&#x27;s in the picture is NOT the colors I received. I ordered matte finish and the compact is full of shimmer and I ordered all browns and got a lot purple.</li>
            <li> Love it! Arrive bfore time looks just that real naked 2 its not the same but the colors are great I just love it</li>
            <li> The colors are nice, and the product arrived two weeks earlier than posted. But when it arrived two of the colors had come completely out of tact and the mirror was extremely dirty. Also a chunk was missing out of the third color. It was worth it for the 12$, but not a penny more. I expect \\&quot;new\\&quot; to look new, not like a toddler threw it against a wall.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a present for my mom and wgen it arrived she was thrilled. It was not broken or damaged so I give this product five stars ;-)</li>
            <li> Product was described great, just wish it didn&#x27;t take so long to delivered. Other than that no other complaints on my end.</li>
            <li> Came in perfect condition and as a bonus it came a least week earlier than expected ! Luv the colors, I would recommend it to any of my friends</li>
            <li> So Im in love with this product. Im also in love with the price. Retail-$53&lt;br /&gt;First off the shades and the shadows are a replica of the Naked 2 palette. It has the exact same everything and it ships pretty fast. Fast enough for me! The color payoff of the shadows is fantastic just like the real palette and same quality!</li>
            <li> I love it the colors are so pretty and go on way well and the brush is way nice I love it</li>
            <li> The product is alright but all around doesn&#x27;t work very effectively and not worth the money even for a knock off version</li>
            <li> Not that I&#x27;ve ever purchased a Naked palette before, but it&#x27;s wonderful for a knock-off! I was surprised to see the box and case said &amp;#34;Naked 2&amp;#34; when it came in the mail (I was only looking for a neutral palette with good ratings). The colors are vibrant even without a primer! The brush that came with the palette is so soft, easy to clean, and applies the eyeshadow wonderfully! I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a quality neutral palette without paying a ton of money!!!</li>
            <li> Its good pigment but the only bad thing about it.  Was the black eyeshadow was not as pigmented as the rest. Other than that eyeshadows were in great condition and I recieved it earlier then expected.</li>
            <li> I love the colors best make up, but you do have to work at the colors to get them to blend the right way</li>
            <li> This make up sucks! Barely even shows plus if you blend the colors thay pretty much all look the same color the black isn&#x27;t even black</li>
            <li> it was a naked palette and its amazing, it has great pigment and came with no scratches, no broken eye shadows or anything. definantly buying again.</li>
            <li> So, this is OBVIOUSLY not the actual Naked 2 palette. It&#x27;s just not. The actual eyeshadows aren&#x27;t as pigmented, so it takes a LOT of product to get the desired effect. But the colors are spot-on to the original, so if you use a little eye shadow primer beforehand, they work fine. And it was $10, versus $50 for the original. I&#x27;m okay with that trade-off.</li>
            <li> Everything about the pallete was amazing! I love it !!! I was a little scared about ordering at first but once I opended the package I couldn&#x27;t be more happier with my purchase the colors on the pallete are so beautiful and pigmented</li>
            <li> The seller states that this is something similar to Urban Decay, so it is a knockoff. And it is shipped internationally, so may take a few weeks to arrive. But it is a really nice palette. I love the neutral colors. They are good on their own, or I blend them together. I find that they stay on fine and blend well. The colors are pretty. They may not be the quality of Urban Decay but they are still a good quality and I am glad that I bought this palette.</li>
            <li> DO NOT PAY MORE THAN $52 on any of the Urban Decay Naked Palettes.  They have naked 1, 2, 3.  They should cost $52 or less!</li>
            <li> This may not be the real deal but for under $20.00 it is so worth it. The colors are beautiful! Dont be scared to order it. I have gotten way less for more money. The pigment is good and they go on beautifully! I feel like i got more than my monies worth! Thank you seller for this opportunity and quick shipping!</li>
            <li> I really like this eyeshadow palette, it has beautiful shades and it comes with a double sided brush. And the price was excellent. It arrive on time, before the due date and in perfect condition. I highly recommend i t. It&#x27;s Urban Decay but with more affordable prices.</li>
            <li> okay so my bestfriend is like obsessed with makeup and she checked it out when i got it and shes pretty sure its the real thing which makes it a steal considering its like a $50 palette!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled, this is not the real Urban Decay pallet. Knock off products made outside the U.S. often contain harmful chemicals such as arsenic and mercury. The price seems to good to be true because it is, this is nothing but a cheap, unsafe knock off, and I&#x27;m honesty surprised that Amazon has not taken counterfeit products such as this off their website.</li>
            <li> I am ALMOST positive that this is the actual Naked 2 pallete! I love love love love it! Its an international order, so of course it took a while to get here but its so worth it! It arrived in perfect condition. Its worth more than I paid for it. I will definitely purchase this again when I use up the one I have now.</li>
            <li> The mirror in the case was all scratched &amp; foggy, but another than that I love the colors. Could of been more secure in the shipping</li>
            <li> This is FAKE. Everything looks real but it&#x27;s not. The quality is terrible. I received it in the mail yesterday and the eyeshadow powders have low pigment so the color barely shows up on your eyelids.</li>
            <li> This is just like the Urban Decay Naked 2 palette, I love it!!! Such great colors!!! Came fast and everything was intact!! Great buy!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely in love with this make up palette it works so well ♡ I love it so much (: x</li>
            <li> Was a gift and it is a favorite and I didn&#x27;t spend to much for eye shadow.  All happy here</li>
            <li> Very pretty on my skin tone &amp; it&#x27;s a lot cheaper here than anywhere else! Great deal. :)&lt;br /&gt;Try this!</li>
            <li> I read reviews before buying this product and I knew it wouldn&#x27;t be exactly the urban decay, but it&#x27;s pretty close and a really good eyeshadow pallette! The mirror was scratchy and blurry but I wouldn&#x27;t really use that mirror anyway</li>
            <li> Its fake.  I was expecting the real deal, they should make it known that it isnt real. im sure people would still buy instead of finding out its rip-off. BOO thumbs down.</li>
            <li> My daughter had to wait almost a month for this item to arrive and, when it did, the metal tin was dented in a couple of places.  Not wanting to wait another month, we kept it.  That being said, the colors are BEAUTIFUL, and the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> I bought this one for a gift but the quality doesn&#x27;t compare to the one that you can buy at Sephora!! The makeup case wouldn&#x27;t open and close properly and also to brush it didn&#x27;t look the same quality as the one I had... You getting what you are paying for!!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both purchased this eye shadow palette during the holidays.  Although we own several of the Urban Decay brand, we thought we&#x27;d give it a try and compare.  We were both pleasantly surprised to the quality and pigment in each shade.  I would definitely recommend if you can&#x27;t afford the &amp;#34;real thing.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The eye shadow arrived and when it did all the colors were broken. The eye shadow was unusable and all mixed together.</li>
            <li> this product goes for alot of money in the store and online I got it cheap and it was in time for Christmas</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting the original palette, NOT! The quality was terrible. The real palette, the eye shadow stays on all day, this...you can&#x27;t even see the color when you put it on and comes off right away. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> People kept saying that this palette is a duplicate but is the real one! I compared Mike with the one my friend has and it is the exact same on it even comes with an urban decay brush and it says it on the front of the palette! Worth the buy!</li>
            <li> It came as Urban Decay Naked 3 pallette. Not what we ordered, but retail on Urban Decay products are $60 and up, I paid $15. I&#x27;ll take that deal any day!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter, but she refused it because she did some research on it and said that it is not good for your skin so I decided to return it, however it cost as much to send it back as it did to purchase it so I decided to keep it and toss it I guess.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what was described and is the true Naked2. I took it into an Ulta and they confirmed it for me. I&#x27;m very excited, this is a great eyeshadow palette!</li>
            <li> This is so worth the buy!!!! I love it so much!  It looks exactly like urban decay, I couldn&#x27;t ask for better!!!!</li>
