            <li> Fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been looking for a natural toothpaste that tastes good.  This is it.  It leaves a clean fresh taste and is completely natural.</li>
            <li> Good toothpaste and vegan friendly, flavor it good and doesn&#x27;t taste too sweet like I&#x27;m eating candy instead of brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> Tastes natural and works well.</li>
            <li> 3 tubes of Tom&#x27;s! What could be better? Came quickly and my teeth are shiny! No issues with this order.</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s is a small company, employing fewer than two hundred people. It was founded in 1970 and then purchased by Colgate in 2006. Fortunately, Colgate has left Tom&#x27;s alone to manage their business according to their original principles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom&#x27;s makes natural products. The toothpaste contains no sugar, sweeteners, or artificial flavoring. By contrast, I looked at a tube of Colgate toothpaste that I have on the shelf. It contains \\&quot;flavor,\\&quot; whatever that is, \\&quot;saccharine,\\&quot; and \\&quot;propylene glycol.\\&quot; The last ingredient is a less-toxic form of anti-freeze. One advantage of Tom&#x27;s toothpaste is that we do not have to worry about ingesting poisons when we use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Tom&#x27;s for years. The toothpaste comes in many flavors. On Amazon, you can find Peppermint, Spearmint, Fennel, Orange-Mango, Cinnamint, Wintermint, Apricot, Soothing Mint, True Mint, and Gingermint, among others. I prefer the Peppermint flavor, which is refreshing, but not overwhelming. The toothpaste is available in sizes from 1 ounce to 6 ounces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not exactly live in a wilderness area, but my local stores no longer carry Tom&#x27;s. Fortunately, it can be found on Amazon and other web sites. The prices do vary from vendor to vendor, so check for the best price.</li>
            <li> I recently switched to this toothpaste. They do have some interesting flavors, so you can mix and match a bit to see what each family member prefers.</li>
            <li> My whole family uses only Tom&#x27;s brand toothpaste. We don&#x27;t all use the same flavor, but we all use Tom&#x27;s.  I still remember the Silly Strawberry flavor on all of my kids&#x27; toddler-sized toothbrushes. Tom&#x27;s was their first toothpaste!  The consistency of Tom&#x27;s is a little different than the other toothpastes we all grew up on but you can trust the ingredients and that counts for a LOT these days.</li>
            <li> this 3 pack is great as I will not have to stock up again for another 2 months or so- Its great since my son and I are taking the natural route on many of our daily diets and activities. Great taste and freshness lasts!  feels like a cleaning after the dentist office visit!!!!  You wont find that warning label on the back of this brand of toothpaste. You know the label on most main stream toothpastes like crest that say &amp;#34;harmful if swallowed in large doses&amp;#34;  but its ok to put those toothpastes in your mouth to brush but not safe if swallowed??? makes you wonder what kinds of chemicals we are using to clean our teeth???  or bodies???  Tom&#x27;s also sells mouthwash and deoderant that I plan to try soon. enjoy!</li>
            <li> I was blown away by this product! Three tubes of toothpaste in one shipment? Revolutionary!!! And it tastes just like the kind you get at the store!</li>
            <li> Has &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; plastered all over the packaging.  I incorrectly insinuated this means no SLS - a foaming agent synthesized in a lab, and a known skin irritant.  I read the ingredients when I got home.  Sure enough, SLS was listed--just like the cheapo brands.  The FDA must be extremely lax with their definition of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;, or there is zero enforcement.</li>
            <li> I love Tom&#x27;s toothpaste&#x27;s and products... I like the philosophy of the company and the pursuit of natural products.  I bought this 3 pack mainly as an accessory to some biodegradable toothbrushes and because it was included with Prime shipping.  I did the math after the fact and it comes to $6 a tube, and you can get it at most stores for $4-$5 a tube (and if your lucky at Big Lot&#x27;s for $2-$3 a tube - but they only get it occasionally)  So I love the product but won&#x27;t be ordering it through Amazon again unless it becomes economical to do so, or I win the lottery :○)</li>
            <li> One of my regular household purchases. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> IF YOU ARE GOING TO SPEND $6 A TUBE IT SHOULD NOT INCLUDE POISONS LIKE FLOURIDE AND SLS WHICH THIS PRODUCT DOES INCLUDE. TRY KISS MY FACE OR NATURES GATE TOOTHPASTE . I SENT MINE BACK</li>
            <li> Good deal and good toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s is Tom&#x27;s...Prompt shipping. Thanks!</li>
