            <li>this hair detangler is the most amazing spray I have ever tried on my girls!!!!</li>
            <li>Pleasant fragrance as well...</li>
            <li>It smells very good which i love.  </li>
            <li>a good buy.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say if the product is any good because I wont use it because of the spray issues.</li>
            <li>It seems to provide good moisture.  </li>
            <li>The product itself is really good, but the spray nozzle squirts the liquid out in a jet stream, and not a mist.</li>
            <li>with all three products gave my son the most beautiful head of curly hair that smells</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m VERY happy with this product and was lucky I didn&#x27;t have to spend a fortune trying to find it.</li>
            <li>and I was so impressed the very first time.</li>
            <li>I got this stuff, and now their hair is shiny, beautiful, soft and smells great!!!!!</li>
            <li>Perfect product for children who are inter-racial because their hair are now more easy to maintain and style while holding in the moisture.</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>and I love that too!</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product!</li>
            <li>As a comparison, the Original Sprout detangler sprays out perfectly, doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling sticky and is a lot more effective at brushing.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, like papaya, peaches, and mangos.  </li>
            <li>and it is amazing</li>
            <li>The product also leaves hair kind of sticky.  </li>
            <li>Since I couldn&#x27;t get a nice application of the stuff I couldn&#x27;t even tell if it worked or not.  </li>
            <li>I always use it when he bathes and it smells nice as well.</li>
            <li>We also use the Original Sprout Detangler before bed, but that product, while great for detangling, has a tendency to pull her hair straighter.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this yummy conditioner :D!</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny and smells great too.</li>
            <li>The best thing ive found so far .</li>
            <li>SINCE I AM NATURAL, I WAS LOOKING FOR PRODUCT THAT WOULD BE SAFE FOR BABIES (SHE IS 8 MONTH) and this works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Also, amazon has a better price than you can find on the vendor&#x27;s website.  </li>
            <li>What more could I ask for?  </li>
            <li>The spray just tangled her hair more and made it greasy.</li>
            <li>once i put the detangler on her hair, it was perfectly smooth without even combing it!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product for my boys.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad they are not greasy or oily.</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s not loaded with chemicals.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>This stuff is just ok.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I just wanted a product to make his curls become bouncy again and stay on top of his head and not in his eyes.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I ended up unscrewing the top and dumping it in my hand to cover my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>but I am no longer able to find it in stores.</li>
            <li>I chose this rating because I love this product.</li>
            <li>It keep their hair in place and looking fabulous all day!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I was very excited for this product.</li>
            <li>it leaves a nice sweet scent.  </li>
            <li>I want to keep his beautiful hair as long as I can, and this spray works like a styling agent and keeps everything in place as well as makes hair look shiny, and curls look amazing.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing and leaves hair feeling really great and tangle free.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use as much and their hair looks really good.  </li>
            <li>but I love this product so much!!!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t come out the spray bottle easily</li>
            <li>Using this moisturizer allows his mom to easily comb through is hair without a fuss.  </li>
            <li>What I like about this product is that it makes the hair easy to comb and style.</li>
            <li>I do like the fact that this detangler does not(in my opinion)smell too strong.</li>
            <li>Now my beautiful girl has no hair on the side or back of her head .</li>
            <li>She has fine curly hair.</li>
            <li>I love the feel, smell and general make-up of the conditioner - very healthy and organic all around.  </li>
            <li>It does an excellent job of hydrating my curls without any heavy residue.</li>
            <li>oh so good and soft to touch I</li>
            <li>now I just washed my girls hair with the children shampoo and some motions conditioner right on top of the shampoo</li>
            <li>They squirm, but it&#x27;s still quick and easy.</li>
            <li>I tried this one and a detangler by Original Sprout simultaneously.  </li>
            <li>Hoping to love them just as much!</li>
            <li>It is lightly scented, but the scent disperses quickly.</li>
            <li>Ok so i really needed the perfect product for my sons hair, his hair is very curly but was always dry</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use any special products on their hair and mind you</li>
            <li>nothing special</li>
            <li>i expected for the price to get a great product....</li>
            <li>It spray fast with one hole in the spray top</li>
            <li>Love this so far and hope to continue with the positive results!!!</li>
            <li>Her hair is no longer dry and this product has a nice scent too!</li>
            <li>Curly Q&#x27;s, on the other hand, makes her curls spring to life, and is a great refresher in the morning (for both of us), before leaving the house.    </li>
            <li>Seriously the BEST conditioner for curly hair.</li>
            <li>The fragrance of this product is so strong and perfume like that it is very overpowering and nauseating.</li>
            <li>This is worth it</li>
            <li>Right after their bath, I put this in their hair and detangle with a Denman brush.</li>
            <li>I have been struggling with finding the right product for my daughter&#x27;s hair for quite some time.  </li>
            <li>I noticed her hair was becoming real dry and more kinky.</li>
            <li>I use this on my daughter&#x27;s curly hair and it detangles perfectly on both wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li>And in return, my four-year-old daughter has the most gorgeous platinum spiral curls down to the middle of her back - and she smells amazing.  </li>
            <li>This works really well with my daughters super curly hair.</li>
            <li>My daughter has super curly hair that can get unruly and this tames it very well.  </li>
            <li>I suppose it could be poured into a different bottle with a better sprayer, but to me it wasn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li>First of all, the spray is frustraiting and secondable</li>
            <li>You provided extremely fast shipping!</li>
            <li>It was one of the first products I purchased and it was the one.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and wish it came in a bigger bottle</li>
            <li>We get stopped wherever we go because people want to \\&quot;sprong\\&quot; my daughter&#x27;s hair or compliment us on how gorgeous her curls are - and they certainly didn&#x27;t want to do that before we started using this product line - when her hair was frizzy and dried out.  </li>
            <li>Does a fantastic job of keeping those curls looking full and moist all day long.</li>
            <li>(maybe it does I haven&#x27;t really researched it too intensely!).</li>
            <li>The product is very light and the ingredients are natural (various fruit extracts and proteins), which was important to me since she is so young.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t refresh her hair or bounce her curls as much as I expected and the smell is strong - not bad but very fruity.  </li>
            <li>My mother in law has super natural curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Unlike most of the conventional \\&quot;curl\\&quot; aids made for adults, this product doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol, which seems like a no-brainer when you&#x27;re talking about moisturizer, right?     </li>
            <li>but I really didnt want to beleive it was faliing out).</li>
            <li>&amp; my girls really like the smell</li>
            <li>plus it&#x27;s very soapy like.</li>
            <li>I also use a very generous amount.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has very curly hair</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t notice much difference in my daughters hair</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Hubby has straight hair and uses it to detangle his hair before brushing it.</li>
            <li>I found this after a internet search a few weeks ago and im thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li>But to be sure the problem wasn&#x27;t simply the bottle, I eventually poured it into another bottle, which worked fine with water, but I guess there&#x27;s something about the consistency of this detangler that makes it less dispersible.  </li>
            <li>Used with other curly Q products , i love it .</li>
            <li>This method actually seems to allow a full saturation into my dd&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>I can see a huge difference in my daughter&#x27;s hair and definition of her natural curls are back.</li>
            <li>It does a decent job</li>
            <li>My son has a head full of curly hair but after a day of not washing his hair, it would start falling flat.</li>
            <li>Also highly recommend the conditioner.</li>
            <li>My son age 5 and daughter age 19 months are mixed black and white and this works  great on there hair.</li>
            <li>I appreciate that it&#x27;s alcohol free because my hair is very dry.  </li>
            <li>This product could be great, but I was unable to find out.  </li>
            <li>First of all it doesn&#x27;t spray out nicely; the product seems to come out in one thin squirt, rather than a mist.  </li>
            <li>So the only way I can use it is by spraying it into my hands and then rubbing into her hair, which is less effective.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I&#x27;m not giving this five stars is because the spray comes out in a stream instead of a mist, meaning I have to spray it into my hand instead of right on my daughters&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li>After looking for the right product for my daughter&#x27;s hair, i have finally found the one.  </li>
            <li>One has tight ringlets and the other has loose corkscrew curls, and Curly Q&#x27;s works brilliantly for both of them.</li>
            <li>As her hair grew out, her cute little curls were going away:(  Her hair is really fine and was always super staticky!!!  </li>
            <li>I personally prefer the coconut conditioner from Curly Qs which is absolutely awsome!</li>
            <li>It smells like yummy fruit at first, later on</li>
            <li>AND SHE ROCKS HER CUTE LITTLE FRO!!</li>
            <li>When our 2 year old&#x27;s hair finally started getting really curly</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 3 years old daughter who has extremaly curly and thiny (mixed)hair.</li>
            <li>I am transitioning from relaxed to natural and use it with the Gel&#x60;les&#x27;c for braid-outs and the style lasts all day with zero frizz.</li>
            <li>My 18 month old is 100% caucasion.</li>
            <li>My moms is also natural curly.  </li>
            <li>Mine is blonde and stick straight</li>
            <li>Since wearing my hair natural, I&#x27;m always looking for something that will keep my kinky-curly hair moisturized and defined.</li>
            <li>I recommend not trying to get a deal and just go directly to curly q site to purchase.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product for my grandson who has soft curly hair.  </li>
            <li>IT MAKES HER HAIR SOFT AND WORKABLE</li>
            <li>She was born with a head full of dark curly hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad product but not necessarily worth the price.  </li>
            <li>One is fine and curly and the other is coarse and curly.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend this product and will be ordering again in the near future.</li>
            <li>I think the static was because her hair was dry and needed moisture, but most other products were too heavy and oily!!!  </li>
            <li>We tried on our daughter&#x27;s  hair, and unfortunately it&#x27;s not what we expected.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many other sprays and lotions from the store and they leave their hair looking really greasy or really hard.</li>
            <li>i actually ordered three different products first the loreal kids 2-1 shampoo and conditioner as well as the mixed chicks line of products</li>
            <li>This spray did exactly what I wanted and it doesn&#x27;t even require a wet head!</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I had high hopes since I love the Curly Q Cream on my daughter&#x27;s curls.  </li>
            <li>She is 2 years old and has ringlet blonde curls - not like the perceived &#x27;targeted&#x27; audience for this product, but her hair thrives with it.  </li>
            <li>the products looked ok when the hair was wet, but as soon as it dried, the hair was dry, course, frizzy.</li>
            <li>I think the product works decent, but I really expected it to come out in a spray instead of a stream.  </li>
            <li>Out of the other curly q products this is my least favorite.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s one wash and rinse and before their hair dries I sprayed it down really well</li>
            <li>While this one does help to brush her hair to some degree, it&#x27;s not nearly as good as the one by Original Sprout.  </li>
            <li>I agree with others that the &amp;#34;stream&amp;#34; spray is ridiculous - although I poured mine into a different bottle that usually has a nice spray and</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I was very excited for this product.</li>
            <li> it leaves a nice sweet scent.  </li>
            <li> I want to keep his beautiful hair as long as I can, and this spray works like a styling agent and keeps everything in place as well as makes hair look shiny, and curls look amazing.</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing and leaves hair feeling really great and tangle free.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use as much and their hair looks really good.  </li>
            <li> but I love this product so much!!!  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come out the spray bottle easily</li>
            <li> Using this moisturizer allows his mom to easily comb through is hair without a fuss.  </li>
            <li> What I like about this product is that it makes the hair easy to comb and style.</li>
            <li> I do like the fact that this detangler does not(in my opinion)smell too strong.</li>
            <li> Now my beautiful girl has no hair on the side or back of her head .</li>
            <li> She has fine curly hair.</li>
            <li> I love the feel, smell and general make-up of the conditioner - very healthy and organic all around.  </li>
            <li> It does an excellent job of hydrating my curls without any heavy residue.</li>
            <li> oh so good and soft to touch I</li>
            <li> now I just washed my girls hair with the children shampoo and some motions conditioner right on top of the shampoo</li>
            <li> They squirm, but it&#x27;s still quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I tried this one and a detangler by Original Sprout simultaneously.  </li>
            <li> Hoping to love them just as much!</li>
            <li> It is lightly scented, but the scent disperses quickly.</li>
            <li> Ok so i really needed the perfect product for my sons hair, his hair is very curly but was always dry</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any special products on their hair and mind you</li>
            <li> nothing special</li>
            <li> i expected for the price to get a great product....</li>
            <li> It spray fast with one hole in the spray top</li>
            <li> Love this so far and hope to continue with the positive results!!!</li>
            <li> Her hair is no longer dry and this product has a nice scent too!</li>
            <li> Curly Q&#x27;s, on the other hand, makes her curls spring to life, and is a great refresher in the morning (for both of us), before leaving the house.    </li>
            <li> Seriously the BEST conditioner for curly hair.</li>
            <li> The fragrance of this product is so strong and perfume like that it is very overpowering and nauseating.</li>
            <li> This is worth it</li>
            <li> Right after their bath, I put this in their hair and detangle with a Denman brush.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with finding the right product for my daughter&#x27;s hair for quite some time.  </li>
            <li> I noticed her hair was becoming real dry and more kinky.</li>
            <li> I use this on my daughter&#x27;s curly hair and it detangles perfectly on both wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li> And in return, my four-year-old daughter has the most gorgeous platinum spiral curls down to the middle of her back - and she smells amazing.  </li>
            <li> This works really well with my daughters super curly hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter has super curly hair that can get unruly and this tames it very well.  </li>
            <li> I suppose it could be poured into a different bottle with a better sprayer, but to me it wasn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li> First of all, the spray is frustraiting and secondable</li>
            <li> You provided extremely fast shipping!</li>
            <li> It was one of the first products I purchased and it was the one.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and wish it came in a bigger bottle</li>
            <li> We get stopped wherever we go because people want to \\&quot;sprong\\&quot; my daughter&#x27;s hair or compliment us on how gorgeous her curls are - and they certainly didn&#x27;t want to do that before we started using this product line - when her hair was frizzy and dried out.  </li>
            <li> Does a fantastic job of keeping those curls looking full and moist all day long.</li>
            <li> (maybe it does I haven&#x27;t really researched it too intensely!).</li>
            <li> The product is very light and the ingredients are natural (various fruit extracts and proteins), which was important to me since she is so young.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t refresh her hair or bounce her curls as much as I expected and the smell is strong - not bad but very fruity.  </li>
            <li> My mother in law has super natural curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Unlike most of the conventional \\&quot;curl\\&quot; aids made for adults, this product doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol, which seems like a no-brainer when you&#x27;re talking about moisturizer, right?     </li>
            <li> but I really didnt want to beleive it was faliing out).</li>
            <li> &amp; my girls really like the smell</li>
            <li> plus it&#x27;s very soapy like.</li>
            <li> I also use a very generous amount.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has very curly hair</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t notice much difference in my daughters hair</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Hubby has straight hair and uses it to detangle his hair before brushing it.</li>
            <li> I found this after a internet search a few weeks ago and im thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li> But to be sure the problem wasn&#x27;t simply the bottle, I eventually poured it into another bottle, which worked fine with water, but I guess there&#x27;s something about the consistency of this detangler that makes it less dispersible.  </li>
            <li> Used with other curly Q products , i love it .</li>
            <li> This method actually seems to allow a full saturation into my dd&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> I can see a huge difference in my daughter&#x27;s hair and definition of her natural curls are back.</li>
            <li> It does a decent job</li>
            <li> My son has a head full of curly hair but after a day of not washing his hair, it would start falling flat.</li>
            <li> Also highly recommend the conditioner.</li>
            <li> My son age 5 and daughter age 19 months are mixed black and white and this works  great on there hair.</li>
            <li> I appreciate that it&#x27;s alcohol free because my hair is very dry.  </li>
            <li> This product could be great, but I was unable to find out.  </li>
            <li> First of all it doesn&#x27;t spray out nicely; the product seems to come out in one thin squirt, rather than a mist.  </li>
            <li> So the only way I can use it is by spraying it into my hands and then rubbing into her hair, which is less effective.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m not giving this five stars is because the spray comes out in a stream instead of a mist, meaning I have to spray it into my hand instead of right on my daughters&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li> After looking for the right product for my daughter&#x27;s hair, i have finally found the one.  </li>
            <li> One has tight ringlets and the other has loose corkscrew curls, and Curly Q&#x27;s works brilliantly for both of them.</li>
            <li> As her hair grew out, her cute little curls were going away:(  Her hair is really fine and was always super staticky!!!  </li>
            <li> I personally prefer the coconut conditioner from Curly Qs which is absolutely awsome!</li>
            <li> It smells like yummy fruit at first, later on</li>
            <li> AND SHE ROCKS HER CUTE LITTLE FRO!!</li>
            <li> When our 2 year old&#x27;s hair finally started getting really curly</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 3 years old daughter who has extremaly curly and thiny (mixed)hair.</li>
            <li> I am transitioning from relaxed to natural and use it with the Gel&#x60;les&#x27;c for braid-outs and the style lasts all day with zero frizz.</li>
            <li> My 18 month old is 100% caucasion.</li>
            <li> My moms is also natural curly.  </li>
            <li> Mine is blonde and stick straight</li>
            <li> Since wearing my hair natural, I&#x27;m always looking for something that will keep my kinky-curly hair moisturized and defined.</li>
            <li> I recommend not trying to get a deal and just go directly to curly q site to purchase.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product for my grandson who has soft curly hair.  </li>
            <li> IT MAKES HER HAIR SOFT AND WORKABLE</li>
            <li> She was born with a head full of dark curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad product but not necessarily worth the price.  </li>
            <li> One is fine and curly and the other is coarse and curly.  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend this product and will be ordering again in the near future.</li>
            <li> I think the static was because her hair was dry and needed moisture, but most other products were too heavy and oily!!!  </li>
            <li> We tried on our daughter&#x27;s  hair, and unfortunately it&#x27;s not what we expected.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many other sprays and lotions from the store and they leave their hair looking really greasy or really hard.</li>
            <li> i actually ordered three different products first the loreal kids 2-1 shampoo and conditioner as well as the mixed chicks line of products</li>
            <li> This spray did exactly what I wanted and it doesn&#x27;t even require a wet head!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had high hopes since I love the Curly Q Cream on my daughter&#x27;s curls.  </li>
            <li> She is 2 years old and has ringlet blonde curls - not like the perceived &#x27;targeted&#x27; audience for this product, but her hair thrives with it.  </li>
            <li> the products looked ok when the hair was wet, but as soon as it dried, the hair was dry, course, frizzy.</li>
            <li> I think the product works decent, but I really expected it to come out in a spray instead of a stream.  </li>
            <li> Out of the other curly q products this is my least favorite.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s one wash and rinse and before their hair dries I sprayed it down really well</li>
            <li> While this one does help to brush her hair to some degree, it&#x27;s not nearly as good as the one by Original Sprout.  </li>
            <li> I agree with others that the &amp;#34;stream&amp;#34; spray is ridiculous - although I poured mine into a different bottle that usually has a nice spray and</li>
            <li> I recently bought the 32oz because the 8oz does not last long enough.</li>
            <li> She is a mix of black &amp; native american with shiny, soft curls.</li>
            <li> I have thick curls (I&#x27;m dominican and I have &amp;#34;halfie hair&amp;#34;) and it works well for me.</li>
            <li> The traditional detangling sprays on the market are so drying that, while they might work that morning, they just serve to dry her hair out over time.  </li>
            <li> they are mixed with Cuban and black and have thin very curly hair!!</li>
            <li> it does not moisturize her dry hair.</li>
            <li> We are  looking  for a product to be used on dry hair.</li>
            <li> I used a few other products that either made the static worse or weighed the hair down making it oily and have build up.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and the smell is terrific.</li>
            <li> The bottle says you can use it on wet or dry hair.  </li>
            <li> (she&#x27;s half Irish)</li>
            <li> She is half African American/Italian.</li>
            <li> her hair is very curly, dry, and thin.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has natural curls because she is half Black and half Puerto Rican.</li>
            <li> I just wet her hair and comb out the knots then</li>
            <li> daughter has white+black mixed hair and this product cut down our hair combing/braiding time by half, with significantly less complaints too.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> Unlike other products that smell like chemicals.</li>
            <li> It shoots out in a sharp stream instead of a spray mist.  </li>
            <li> i tried johnson and johnson products which made it worse as well as other greasy products, finally i did some research and came upon this product the curly q&#x27;s moist curls detangler daily curl moisturizer</li>
            <li> One complaint that may be specific to the bottle we bought: the spray comes out in a single stream and not the typical spray.  </li>
            <li> I moist it down a little because if hair is completely dry it makes it frizzy.  </li>
            <li> so  for us is not easy to spread on her dry hair.</li>
            <li> My child is mixed and her hair is extremely curly and thick.</li>
            <li> She has thick curly hair with multiple curl patters.  </li>
            <li> My daughter is hispanic and black.  </li>
            <li> she is half black and Filipino if that gives you any idea about her hair texture.</li>
            <li> Hair curls up tight and springy (like spirals).</li>
            <li> I ordered a bottle and when I received it and used it it came out as a thick single stream of liquid.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to make blond hair moisturized - harder still to make it LOOK moist: shiny and glossy.  </li>
            <li> But this product has eliminated the messy greasiness.  </li>
            <li> I was worried this might be too heavy for her hair, but it isn&#x27;t at all.  </li>
            <li> To heavy, don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> It should be in green and purple packaging.</li>
            <li> and i was searching for a product that would tame her curls.</li>
            <li> Even if we liked how the product worked, we are not able to use it because of the awful smell.</li>
            <li> I usually add water too, to enhance the curl in her hair.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure which (or it could be all) of the curly q products</li>
            <li> It did not evenly coat her hair, but instead saturated the small area where the stream landed.  </li>
            <li> I started using the Curls line shortly after my biracial daughter was born and was not impressed.</li>
            <li> She has very thin tiny curls and brushing them is a nightmare.  </li>
            <li> Her hair runs on the thick, slighly curly/kinky side.  </li>
            <li> This product left a horrible \\&quot;film\\&quot; on her hair and made it smell and feel gross....</li>
            <li> I have purchased 2 of these with the same issues, so it wasn&#x27;t just one bad bottle.</li>
            <li> I was not happy.</li>
            <li> Our daughter has thin but  a cuuuuurly hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s frustrating because my mother comes home, loaded with crappy product that she buys on sale for $1 a bottle.  </li>
            <li> unfortunately, this product didn&#x27;t work for my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> She couldn&#x27;t figure out why I was using expensive product that didn&#x27;t appear to be for</li>
            <li> And yes, it&#x27;s expensive.  </li>
            <li> i was wrong</li>
            <li> SORRY</li>
            <li> Wrong item sent.  </li>
            <li> Go ahead and give it a try, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> So I returned it thinking I got a bad bottle nozzle.</li>
            <li> We stopped trying... :(</li>
            <li> All I know is that my daughter&#x27;s ringlets were turning into crap with the crap we were using and this stuff works -</li>
            <li> I HATE TYPING</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t leave any nasty residue!.</li>
            <li> The sprayer on the bottle is horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This works really well with my daughters super curly hair.</li>
            <li> Does a fantastic job of keeping those curls looking full and moist all day long. Pleasant fragrance as well...a good buy.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m not giving this five stars is because the spray comes out in a stream instead of a mist, meaning I have to spray it into my hand instead of right on my daughters&#x27; hair. I have twin toddlers of mixed race. One has tight ringlets and the other has loose corkscrew curls, and Curly Q&#x27;s works brilliantly for both of them. Right after their bath, I put this in their hair and detangle with a Denman brush. They squirm, but it&#x27;s still quick and easy. I get defined, soft-to-the-touch curls every time. It is lightly scented, but the scent disperses quickly. I recommend it to anyone who has children with curly, easy-to-tangle hair.</li>
            <li> We bought this for our daughter who has curly hair that tends to get frizzy.  This is great to use to freshen curls the day after a wash.  It smells amazing, like papaya, peaches, and mangos.  Everyone always compliments on how great she smells!  One complaint that may be specific to the bottle we bought: the spray comes out in a single stream and not the typical spray.  The product still works great and I&#x27;m hoping the next bottle we buy doesn&#x27;t have the spray problem.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with finding the right product for my daughter&#x27;s hair for quite some time.  She has very thin tiny curls and brushing them is a nightmare.  This product sounded great.  I tried this one and a detangler by Original Sprout simultaneously.  While this one does help to brush her hair to some degree, it&#x27;s not nearly as good as the one by Original Sprout.  First of all it doesn&#x27;t spray out nicely; the product seems to come out in one thin squirt, rather than a mist.  Actually, the bottle it came in turned out to be defective.  But to be sure the problem wasn&#x27;t simply the bottle, I eventually poured it into another bottle, which worked fine with water, but I guess there&#x27;s something about the consistency of this detangler that makes it less dispersible.  So the only way I can use it is by spraying it into my hands and then rubbing into her hair, which is less effective.  The product also leaves hair kind of sticky.  As a comparison, the Original Sprout detangler sprays out perfectly, doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling sticky and is a lot more effective at brushing.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 3 years old daughter who has extremaly curly and thiny (mixed)hair. First of all, the spray is frustraiting and secondable it does not moisturize her dry hair. It does not make it easier to detangle either. It smells amazing thou! I personally prefer the coconut conditioner from Curly Qs which is absolutely awsome!</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd purchase of this product from Amazon.  Aside from the conditioner not \\&quot;misting\\&quot; out of the bottle - it has only ever come out in a stream spray - I love it!  I just spray it into my palm and use my fingertips to run it through my daughter&#x27;s hair.  This method actually seems to allow a full saturation into my dd&#x27;s hair.  I usually add water too, to enhance the curl in her hair.  She is 2 years old and has ringlet blonde curls - not like the perceived &#x27;targeted&#x27; audience for this product, but her hair thrives with it.  She definitely needs the conditioner to keep snarls and tangles at bay.  I love the feel, smell and general make-up of the conditioner - very healthy and organic all around.  I feel good about using this on my baby&#x27;s head and plan to keep using Curly Q&#x27;s! I highly recommend this yummy conditioner :D!</li>
            <li> After trying everything on my daughter&#x27;s hair, this is the best product that helps me comb it every morning.  My daughter is of mixed heritage, and the hair products on the market for African-American hair do not match her hair texture.  Also, amazon has a better price than you can find on the vendor&#x27;s website.  What more could I ask for?  Go ahead and give it a try, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> unfortunately, this product didn&#x27;t work for my daughter&#x27;s hair. My child is mixed and her hair is extremely curly and thick. The spray just tangled her hair more and made it greasy. I was not happy.</li>
            <li> If I could give this product line zero stars I would. I am not sure which (or it could be all) of the curly q products made her hair fall out. I was using the detanger, the mimosa oil, the cleansing cutie shampoo and coconut dream conditioner. None of them worked on her hair. She has fine curly hair. the products looked ok when the hair was wet, but as soon as it dried, the hair was dry, course, frizzy. And after about 4 months of using this products, her hair fell out (it started gradually but I really didnt want to beleive it was faliing out). Now my beautiful girl has no hair on the side or back of her head . She looks like the guy from kid and play.</li>
            <li> I use this on my daughter&#x27;s curly hair and it detangles perfectly on both wet and dry hair. I am transitioning from relaxed to natural and use it with the Gel&#x60;les&#x27;c for braid-outs and the style lasts all day with zero frizz. I recently bought the 32oz because the 8oz does not last long enough. It&#x27;s definitely a staple for us.</li>
            <li> I am a foster mom, and had no idea how to keep my kids hair all moist and shiny... I got this stuff, and now their hair is shiny, beautiful, soft and smells great!!!!! and it doesn&#x27;t leave any nasty residue!.</li>
            <li> My daughter has super curly hair that can get unruly and this tames it very well.  She loves the smell and asks me to put it in her hair every day.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product.  I have two mixed boys and they both have two different hair textures.  One is fine and curly and the other is coarse and curly.  But this product has eliminated the messy greasiness.  I don&#x27;t have to use as much and their hair looks really good.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> We tried on our daughter&#x27;s  hair, and unfortunately it&#x27;s not what we expected. Our daughter has thin but  a cuuuuurly hair. It&#x27;s not a spray or a liquid so it&#x27;s like a liquid-gel , so  for us is not easy to spread on her dry hair. We stopped trying... :( ....We are  looking  for a product to be used on dry hair.</li>
            <li> The sprayer on the bottle is horrible. I can&#x27;t say if the product is any good because I wont use it because of the spray issues.</li>
            <li> Ok so i really needed the perfect product for my sons hair, his hair is very curly but was always dry i tried johnson and johnson products which made it worse as well as other greasy products, finally i did some research and came upon this product the curly q&#x27;s moist curls detangler daily curl moisturizer and it is amazing i actually ordered three different products first the loreal kids 2-1 shampoo and conditioner as well as the mixed chicks line of products the leave in conditioner, so with all three products gave my son the most beautiful head of curly hair that smells oh so good and soft to touch I HIGHLY recommend this product and will be ordering again in the near future.</li>
            <li> I think the product works decent, but I really expected it to come out in a spray instead of a stream.  I was looking for a spray, so that&#x27;s what I would have preferred.</li>
            <li> this hair detangler is the most amazing spray I have ever tried on my girls!!!! I don&#x27;t use any special products on their hair and mind you they are mixed with Cuban and black and have thin very curly hair!! I have tried so many other sprays and lotions from the store and they leave their hair looking really greasy or really hard. so eventually I got on Amazon and started reading reviews after reviews because I needed something for my girls here because they are mixed. finally I saw all the reviews on this and the type of hair I would work on and I ordered it and I was so impressed the very first time. now I just washed my girls hair with the children shampoo and some motions conditioner right on top of the shampoo so it&#x27;s one wash and rinse and before their hair dries I sprayed it down really well and I can brush it out with a regular brush and I always put it up so it doesn&#x27;t get tangled all over again. so happy I found this spray!!!!!! &amp; my girls really like the smell</li>
            <li> After looking for the right product for my daughter&#x27;s hair, i have finally found the one.  My daughter is hispanic and black.  her hair is very curly, dry, and thin.  once i put the detangler on her hair, it was perfectly smooth without even combing it!  It smells very good which i love.  Unlike other products that smell like chemicals.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product for my boys. I&#x27;m glad they are not greasy or oily. Perfect product for children who are inter-racial because their hair are now more easy to maintain and style while holding in the moisture.</li>
            <li> Life saver!!!&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has white+black mixed hair and this product cut down our hair combing/braiding time by half, with significantly less complaints too.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
            <li> Out of the other curly q products this is my least favorite. It spray fast with one hole in the spray top plus it&#x27;s very soapy like.</li>
            <li> This is worth it and I use it on my hair too.</li>
            <li> We use this product daily on our daughter&#x27;s hair.  Works wonders for both moisturizing and comb-ability.  Love that it&#x27;s not loaded with chemicals.  Smells great, too!  Also highly recommend the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I use this for my infant daughter, who has curly baby hair.  The product is very light and the ingredients are natural (various fruit extracts and proteins), which was important to me since she is so young.  It smells like yummy fruit at first, later on it leaves a nice sweet scent.  It seems to provide good moisture.  Avenue You provided extremely fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I found this after a internet search a few weeks ago and im thrilled with it.  My son age 5 and daughter age 19 months are mixed black and white and this works  great on there hair.I wouldnt use anything else..</li>
            <li> My daughter has ringlets that would put Shirley Temple to shame.  The traditional detangling sprays on the market are so drying that, while they might work that morning, they just serve to dry her hair out over time.  It&#x27;s frustrating because my mother comes home, loaded with crappy product that she buys on sale for $1 a bottle.  I finally gave my mom (my daughter&#x27;s grandmother) a hair intervention.  She couldn&#x27;t figure out why I was using expensive product that didn&#x27;t appear to be for \\&quot;us\\&quot; (since we&#x27;re white as white can be).    All I know is that my daughter&#x27;s ringlets were turning into crap with the crap we were using and this stuff works - I don&#x27;t care what aisle of the store it would be on.  And yes, it&#x27;s expensive.  Whatever.      We use the Curly Q Coconut Dream Moisturizing Conditioner as a \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot;, and then we spray her with this.  And in return, my four-year-old daughter has the most gorgeous platinum spiral curls down to the middle of her back - and she smells amazing.  All this out of two products.  She calls it her Princess shampoo and spray.    We get stopped wherever we go because people want to \\&quot;sprong\\&quot; my daughter&#x27;s hair or compliment us on how gorgeous her curls are - and they certainly didn&#x27;t want to do that before we started using this product line - when her hair was frizzy and dried out.  It&#x27;s hard to make blond hair moisturized - harder still to make it LOOK moist: shiny and glossy.  These products do both.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews... but I love this product so much!!!  My 18 month old is 100% caucasion. She was born with a head full of dark curly hair.  My mother in law has super natural curly hair.  My moms is also natural curly.  Mine is blonde and stick straight and I have never had to deal with curls.  As her hair grew out, her cute little curls were going away:(  Her hair is really fine and was always super staticky!!!  I used a few other products that either made the static worse or weighed the hair down making it oily and have build up.  I got this along with the cream cleanser.  I have only used the cream cleanser once since we just wash her hair one a week.  But I have used this detangler for 3 days in a row in the morning and after naps.  The static is gone!!!  The curls are coming back!!!  No build-up or greasy look!!!  I also use a very generous amount.  The bottle says you can use it on wet or dry hair.  I moist it down a little because if hair is completely dry it makes it frizzy.  I just ordered the coconut conditioner and the styling custard as well.  Hoping to love them just as much! I was worried this might be too heavy for her hair, but it isn&#x27;t at all.  I think the static was because her hair was dry and needed moisture, but most other products were too heavy and oily!!!  Love this so far and hope to continue with the positive results!!!</li>
            <li> I agree with others that the &amp;#34;stream&amp;#34; spray is ridiculous - although I poured mine into a different bottle that usually has a nice spray and it still &amp;#34;streamed&amp;#34; so it must be that this is a thicker liquid, not bottle design.  So yes, it basically globs in my daughter&#x27;s hair and I have to scrunch it with my fingers.  It didn&#x27;t refresh her hair or bounce her curls as much as I expected and the smell is strong - not bad but very fruity.  It&#x27;s not a bad product but not necessarily worth the price.  You could just use water or any curl spray from the store.</li>
            <li> This product could be great, but I was unable to find out.  It shoots out in a sharp stream instead of a spray mist.  When I tried it on my daughter&#x27;s hair it startled her.  It did not evenly coat her hair, but instead saturated the small area where the stream landed.  It reminded me of a water gun!  I suppose it could be poured into a different bottle with a better sprayer, but to me it wasn&#x27;t worth it.  Unfortunately I had high hopes since I love the Curly Q Cream on my daughter&#x27;s curls.  But I think I&#x27;ll stick with the Mixed Chicks Kids detangling spray.</li>
            <li> I ordered a bottle and when I received it and used it it came out as a thick single stream of liquid. So it just soaked my kid&#x27;s hair in one place. There was no mist/spray at all. So I returned it thinking I got a bad bottle nozzle. I ordered a replacement. When I got the replacement it also was just a stream with no mist spray. Since I couldn&#x27;t get a nice application of the stuff I couldn&#x27;t even tell if it worked or not.  I&#x27;m not going to try a third time though. I&#x27;m just going to find something else.</li>
            <li> This is the best spray for my daughter&#x27;s hair. She is a mix of black &amp; native american with shiny, soft curls. I keep some in my diaper bag for car seat head. It is also great in the morning &amp; after naps.</li>
            <li> Since wearing my hair natural, I&#x27;m always looking for something that will keep my kinky-curly hair moisturized and defined. When our 2 year old&#x27;s hair finally started getting really curly (she&#x27;s half Irish) I grabbed this stuff because it&#x27;s for kids.  Two months later, we are both using it! Unlike most of the conventional \\&quot;curl\\&quot; aids made for adults, this product doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol, which seems like a no-brainer when you&#x27;re talking about moisturizer, right?     We also use the Original Sprout Detangler before bed, but that product, while great for detangling, has a tendency to pull her hair straighter. Curly Q&#x27;s, on the other hand, makes her curls spring to life, and is a great refresher in the morning (for both of us), before leaving the house.    I am not a fan of the stream spray either, but the product works so great, I&#x27;ll allow them some leeway on their engineering.</li>
            <li> I was very excited for this product. My daughter has very curly hair and i was searching for a product that would tame her curls. This product left a horrible \\&quot;film\\&quot; on her hair and made it smell and feel gross.... i expected for the price to get a great product.... i was wrong</li>
            <li> It does a decent job but I don&#x27;t love it. Especially the way it sprays. It doesn&#x27;t mist at all. It sprays in one spot and one spot only.</li>
            <li> To heavy, don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using curly q&#x27;s for 4 years now for all 3 of my kids. This is not the correct product as advertised! It should be in green and purple packaging. I recommend not trying to get a deal and just go directly to curly q site to purchase.</li>
            <li> This stuff is just ok. It doesn&#x27;t come out the spray bottle easily and I don&#x27;t notice much difference in my daughters hair</li>
            <li> The product itself is really good, but the spray nozzle squirts the liquid out in a jet stream, and not a mist. I have to spray it into my hand and then work it into her hair.  I have purchased 2 of these with the same issues, so it wasn&#x27;t just one bad bottle.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product. My son has a head full of curly hair but after a day of not washing his hair, it would start falling flat. That meant it would start getting in his eyes. I just wanted a product to make his curls become bouncy again and stay on top of his head and not in his eyes. This spray did exactly what I wanted and it doesn&#x27;t even require a wet head! It also smells amazing! I use it all the time now and it&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s all natural. I have also been using the Coconut Dream moisturizing conditioner by Curly Q&#x27;s and I love that too! I always use it when he bathes and it smells nice as well. I&#x27;m VERY happy with this product and was lucky I didn&#x27;t have to spend a fortune trying to find it. It was one of the first products I purchased and it was the one. Thanks Curly Q&#x27;s! Now I won&#x27;t have to cut my sons hair so soon! I want to keep his beautiful hair as long as I can, and this spray works like a styling agent and keeps everything in place as well as makes hair look shiny, and curls look amazing. Love it.</li>
            <li> I use this product in conjunction with their moisturizing curl cream. It does an excellent job of hydrating my curls without any heavy residue. I have thick curls (I&#x27;m dominican and I have &amp;#34;halfie hair&amp;#34;) and it works well for me.</li>
            <li> I started using the Curls line shortly after my biracial daughter was born and was not impressed. She has thick curly hair with multiple curl patters.  It sprays in a short stream and does not saturate the hair. I ended up unscrewing the top and dumping it in my hand to cover my daughter&#x27;s hair.It still didn&#x27;t work. I ended up throwing it away.</li>
            <li> My daughter has incredibly curly hair and this product keeps the curls looking great. I just wet her hair and comb out the knots then spray this into my hands and run it through her hair. Hair curls up tight and springy (like spirals). Target used to carry this line of children hair care but I am no longer able to find it in stores. It is worth every penny and smells great too.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product twice for my oldest daughter. She is half African American/Italian. Her hair runs on the thick, slighly curly/kinky side.  This product does detangle her hair. However, I find myself using a ton of it at once to get the product to work. It may be that the nozzle the company uses on this product just doesn&#x27;t quite spray enough detangler at once.  I do like the fact that this detangler does not(in my opinion)smell too strong.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped. I feel like I have to douse my baby&#x27;s head with it for it to make a big difference...she is half black and Filipino if that gives you any idea about her hair texture.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product for my grandson who has soft curly hair.  Using this moisturizer allows his mom to easily comb through is hair without a fuss.  I been purchasing it now for over a year.</li>
            <li> SINCE I AM NATURAL, I WAS LOOKING FOR PRODUCT THAT WOULD BE SAFE FOR BABIES (SHE IS 8 MONTH) and this works perfectly. SORRY I HATE TYPING AND DID NOT WANT TO GO BACK AND CHANGE THE MISTAKES. IT MAKES HER HAIR SOFT AND WORKABLE AND SHE ROCKS HER CUTE LITTLE FRO!!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product! My daughter has natural curls because she is half Black and half Puerto Rican. I noticed her hair was becoming real dry and more kinky. Did some research and decided to give this product a try. I can see a huge difference in my daughter&#x27;s hair and definition of her natural curls are back.Her hair is no longer dry and this product has a nice scent too!</li>
            <li> I appreciate that it&#x27;s alcohol free because my hair is very dry.  It seems to work well enough for reviving my curls.  Hubby has straight hair and uses it to detangle his hair before brushing it.</li>
            <li> Used with other curly Q products , i love it . The best thing ive found so far . would def recommend this for curly or people with mixed hair</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because I love this product. What I like about this product is that it makes the hair easy to comb and style. I have twin baby girls and it works wonders on their hair. It keep their hair in place and looking fabulous all day!</li>
            <li> Wrong item sent.  Not as advertised.</li>
            <li> The fragrance of this product is so strong and perfume like that it is very overpowering and nauseating. Even if we liked how the product worked, we are not able to use it because of the awful smell.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok. nothing special though</li>
            <li> Seriously the BEST conditioner for curly hair. I bought it for my son, but use it as well. A little goes a long way, and the smell is terrific. It is very moisturizing and leaves hair feeling really great and tangle free. I love this stuff and wish it came in a bigger bottle (maybe it does I haven&#x27;t really researched it too intensely!).</li>
