            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>the caps &#x3D;&amp;#62; Original -  plastic with a tin-type shell</li>
            <li>; Original - awesome&lt;br</li>
            <li>Clean and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Maybe a bit much for work, though a light application would probably be okay.</li>
            <li>Most reviews seems overwhelmingly positive though, so my purchase may have just been a lemon.</li>
            <li>Most of the positive ones are fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent is very clean, crisp and manly.</li>
            <li>By far Amazon&#x27;s price is incomparable !!  </li>
            <li>He was pleasantly surprised and pleased to receive it as a Christmas gift!  </li>
            <li>Becoming a new favorite of mine.  </li>
            <li>It smells great when applied, you loose the smell when you ware it</li>
            <li>Ever since then I have been getting this for him on special occasions when he is close to running out.  </li>
            <li>KCB smells very nice(not too sweet, not too musky) and lasts a lot longer than my Armani Code and is more affordable.</li>
            <li>Omg this is so soft I bought this for my husband just because and let me tell you this smell amazing</li>
            <li>Just lemon smell light that means its not citrus smell citrus smell light orange smell if I&#x27;m not wrong...</li>
            <li>second time I got this because the first time I was so happy with the product.</li>
            <li>Saying this through true experience.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>People pass you by and they turn to say, you smell sweet.</li>
            <li>It has sweet, yet manly odor about it that doesn&#x27;t cause an allergic reaction like some stronger colognes.</li>
            <li>so he would be able to tell if it was the real thing, it was.</li>
            <li>Good for all occasions and would not be likely to offend anyone.  </li>
            <li>I really wouldn&#x27;t say an appropriate work cologne.  </li>
            <li>Now it goes in the collection with my Versace Eros, Giorgio Armani Aqua Di Gio, and Cool Water...</li>
            <li>and he wear it all full day.</li>
            <li>For me this fragrance is too sweet.</li>
            <li>Got such a good deal on this</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and safe.</li>
            <li>What i did notice is that after a few hours the scent becomes softer and more pleasant.</li>
            <li>If one wants to stand out in a crowd without saying a word, this cologne speaks for you; it says that you are confident, bold and value quality and authenticity.</li>
            <li>To reiterate, the price for such a pleasant fragrance is unbeatable and Black would be a great fragrance for those starting to amass a good collection.  </li>
            <li>What i did notice is that after a few hours the scent becomes softer and more pleasant.  </li>
            <li>As advertised, lasts around 3to4 hours on my body then turns into a more \\&quot;fruity\\&quot; smell which actually smells better than the original.  </li>
            <li>It is not overly aromatic after the first 15-20 minutes, but can be easily detected when in close quarters.</li>
            <li>the scent is strong for the first 10-15 mins.</li>
            <li>This is a great place to buy other stuff but not fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than that great price and sealed packaging.</li>
            <li>Thus it deserves two stars!...mostly because of the price and quick shipping.</li>
            <li>It had a mild skunk smell.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t fade quickly either.</li>
            <li>so holiday season I had zero life or time - came so quick and just as stated -</li>
            <li>I enjoy this very much, and my wife loves it.</li>
            <li>Nothing special or exciting about it.</li>
            <li>This is a nice clean sent that last all day.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li>smell is mild and fresh scented.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>The item is reasonably priced and ships very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I love this very masculine aroma and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>Just wore it the other day and smells AMAZING!</li>
            <li>He used it the first day i gave it to him!</li>
            <li>I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR SURE!</li>
            <li>The product was just as described and was exactly what the photo showed!</li>
            <li>This smells good, clean little sweet, almost like a soapy smell, not unpleasant, for me its a day time scent.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful smell, rich and bold, and lasts a considerably long time compared to other colognes.  </li>
            <li>Hope you enjoy it as much as we do.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t complain it is fabulous really</li>
            <li>It has two distinct scents...alcohol and the flavor you should smell.  </li>
            <li>It was as expected and arrived in good time.</li>
            <li>He liked the smell enough to ask the guy what it was he wore.  </li>
            <li>this is by far one of the better colognes that i have used.</li>
            <li>It had been about 10 yrs since my last gift of cologne from the dear, so I thought I&#x27;d experiment on my own.</li>
            <li>I have been smiled at repeated and complimented several times since I began using this</li>
            <li>So far it gets the attention that many of the reviews have stated.</li>
            <li>Some of my co-workers say they love being near me just to smell me.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite cologne for my husband.</li>
            <li>This is a different kind of oder.  </li>
            <li>The actual product is nice.</li>
            <li>it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>I get more attention from the smell of this stuff then most other colognes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottle is very nice and heavy and shiny box that means they invest in bottle and box not for perfume</li>
            <li>I can tell you with 100% certainty I received the genuine product packaged exactly as I bought it at the upscale department store from which I purchased the 2nd bottle for over $20 more.</li>
            <li>Right product, arrived on time.</li>
            <li>dont use right before you are going to meet some one..</li>
            <li>This is just right</li>
            <li>It was delivered right to my doorstep.</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>Just the right smell.</li>
            <li>This cologne can be used right before going to the gym as well as for going on a dinner date.  </li>
            <li>You want to smell sexy, strong, and masculine (not being a stereotype Brute, Aqua Velva, Old Spice wearing stereotype?</li>
            <li>Its a nice fragrance for an evening party, but is a little too strong to be used in the day.</li>
            <li>It is sometimes 2 -3 times more expensive in stores, I will always search it out on Amazon to get an amazing price and have it delivered right to my door :)</li>
            <li>Very fresh smell, for any ocassion and very classy of course !</li>
            <li>Product is great as usual...</li>
            <li>It smells nice and lasts long.</li>
            <li>Super long lasting scent great for work, dress  and leisure.</li>
            <li>product is good, its strong but for some reason I don;t see it lasting long.</li>
            <li>i am a little worried if this is authentic, it&#x27;s sold by amazon so it has to be authentic</li>
            <li>This definately has a strong spicy masculine smell.  </li>
            <li>Kennth Cole Black is a really good value.</li>
            <li>The perfume is good but not what i expected, the reach of the fragrance isn&#x27;t too much.</li>
            <li>they were quick and reasonably priced.. as my daughter says, she loves her smells goods....</li>
            <li>Amazing product, long lasting and gets even better by time.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>What I personally look for in a scent is a strong, manly, yet sweet smell that gets the ladies attention.</li>
            <li>and he loves this very much.</li>
            <li>I got quantity at a price point very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am pleased with the product and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good cologne for less than 30 dollars.</li>
            <li>Out of the bottle, the opening of citrus and green notes are easy on the nose that develops into an elegant blend of fresh, spicy, floral and musk notes which make Black easily wearable during any season and for most events.  </li>
            <li>Black smells nice but wears off somewhat quickly and can leave an alcohol after-smell.</li>
            <li>I got compliments sometimes (not always ;))</li>
            <li>This one is my personal favorite.  </li>
            <li>I will always by my perfume/cologne from Amazon, so much cheaper!</li>
            <li>Great product with long lasting scent...</li>
            <li>And exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>He had smelled this on a guy in front of him while waiting to get Hot Wings.  </li>
            <li>1 Star for packing shipping and filled bottle for full of spirits alcohol mixed with Lemon smell...</li>
            <li>The letterings on the bottle I had purchased from Amazon were different than the ones on the smaller bottle, most notably the letterings for &amp;#34;Kenneth Cole&amp;#34; underneath &amp;#34;BLACK.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Kenneth Cole can do no wrong</li>
            <li>Its exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Product came exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite cologne and I will only buy this one.</li>
            <li>This is my first time placing an order for perfumes from Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>smelling at first but firms up after exposure to the air.</li>
            <li>An instant favorite</li>
            <li>When my mini one runs out, I will buy the larger one that&#x27;s for sure.  </li>
            <li>and it is a real winner in my book!</li>
            <li>Guys, please wear this so women will swoon, it really is intoxicating!</li>
            <li>I have been complimented many times on the fragrance and would definitely purchase it again.  </li>
            <li>He used to wear it when we first met.</li>
            <li>Got many complements from the ladies from work and outside.</li>
            <li>I bought this with out smelling it first</li>
            <li>Sure beats the $80 price tag I found on it in the department store last week.</li>
            <li>The product was exactly as advertised and delivery was speedy.</li>
            <li>My girl loves the smell as have most of my female friends.</li>
            <li>I still have had many compliments on it though regardless of my personal feelings.</li>
            <li>Exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>My first review EVER</li>
            <li>(maybe this is legit legal terms that are in a gray area)!</li>
            <li>this is legit legal terms that are in a gray area)!</li>
            <li>The smells seems a little strong for work and more like for a club, but I don,t go to any clubs</li>
            <li>it got to be watered down its a good cologne to by if your going to get the real thing</li>
            <li>The three I have just listed really leave a \\&quot;YOU\\&quot; statement that stands upright as a classic unique gent when meeting, greeting, and leaving a statement amongst others.</li>
            <li>For$30 less, I was able to get this fantastic cologne.</li>
            <li>Its probably a bit to strong to wear to work, but great to wear on casual nights out.</li>
            <li>Now, the product itself is just amazing, the scent is fresh, young but not too young, I&#x27;m 30 years old</li>
            <li>Wife liked it but not as well as other sprays.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this to give as a gift and it arrived without the original box or cap and is clearly marked \\&quot;tester\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>this best fragment will last long.. even people ask me at work defendly recomed for a date or personal use</li>
            <li>Through most of my important situations, not my everyday cologne though.</li>
            <li>take spirits alcohol mix fresh green lemon juice, smell that on your own risk.</li>
            <li>pretty much all that matters.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an extremely fancy cologne but is perfect for everyday use as it is not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>This has been my favorite cologne for a long time.</li>
            <li>it is a mix of sweet, citrus, with some spicy masculine notes, although i would say it edges toward feminine...</li>
            <li>This is a manly scent good for everyday use!  </li>
            <li>Seriously though, great scent and a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>liked everything about the product except the price which is little bit on the higher side for its category.</li>
            <li>I liked Kenneth Cole Black</li>
            <li>Smell good last long on u</li>
            <li>It really good and long lasting, I will recommend it to people.</li>
            <li>smell great...very strong and lasting scent</li>
            <li>Last a good long time too.</li>
            <li>It smells good, but it does not last long.</li>
            <li>It lasts longer than KC Reaction, but certainly won&#x27;t get you through the day.  </li>
            <li>the top does not latch on to the bottle it just sits loosely on, #3</li>
            <li>It came earlier than expected, new (no tester sticker like some have said), and smells great.</li>
            <li>Thank you, Amazon.com, for carrying such fine and affordable merchandise.</li>
            <li>Very manly.</li>
            <li>Initially it smells like a cheap cologne.</li>
            <li>Very distinctive and outdoorsey.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend also really likes this cologne and therefore I got it.</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>Product scent really goes away after around 3 hours.</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed with the item.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Purchased a bottle and found that it smells very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very citrusy and low-key.</li>
            <li>If you have tastes similar to mine then you will enjoy this.</li>
            <li>As a modern day man.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say much about scent tones, maybe earthy/woody?  </li>
            <li>I am very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>Very distinctive and outdoorsey.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon....</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this cologne.</li>
            <li>I got deal before buy 3 get 3 free total 6 for $99</li>
            <li>I just wish I could get a refund and just go buy the real thing...</li>
            <li>not so much like me.</li>
            <li>this really gives me confidence when I talk with some one in close range..</li>
            <li>it lasts for the whole day.</li>
            <li>This the real deal.</li>
            <li>and I do really like it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>so much I ordered two.&lt;br /&gt;Great scent.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say much.</li>
            <li>It was well packaged and delivered real soon...</li>
            <li>It is real and not a knock off.</li>
            <li>Like the name and bottle dont really care for smell.  </li>
            <li>so much I use it sometimes even if I am not going anywhere.  </li>
            <li>is it really affordable</li>
            <li>He loves it, his girlfriend loves it -- for the price, and the ULTRA FAST shipping 4 days before Christmas, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>but if you spray it on your skin instead of your clothes then it will stay on there the whole day.</li>
            <li>It goes really well with leather bags and black/dark clothing.</li>
            <li>IS HOW A MODERN DAY MAN SHOULD SMELL.</li>
            <li>It has a very manly smell.</li>
            <li>To me, it is just as intense as Stetson.  </li>
            <li>Play Intense</li>
            <li>I really like the way it smelled.</li>
            <li>very happy.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Packaged very well to protect the glass bottle.</li>
            <li>I received this cologne as a present about 2 years ago and really enjoy the scent.  </li>
            <li>and I really like the way it smells</li>
            <li>Go to Macy&#x27;s and you&#x27;ll spend too much.</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon for not being unreasonable.</li>
            <li>Having owned this before, I can testify without any doubt that this is the real thing.</li>
            <li>Also much cheaper on amazon than in a department store.</li>
            <li>The perfume is very musky as well as spicy.</li>
            <li>Anywho, I sprayed it and immediately noticed it smelled kiiiiiiiind of like the real thing</li>
            <li>Nice smell, lasts well I use it for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Its such a sexy and masculine scent.</li>
            <li>The last cologne I really liked was Polo Blue.</li>
            <li>He now has a new favorite cologne and it is very inexpensive for such a high quality.</li>
            <li>and I thought this would be a nice gift at a little better price when compared to other retailers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not strong, though is not light at all, it&#x27;s absolutely awesome.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend this cologne for first dates or romantic evenings with that special someone.</li>
            <li>Not too strong, and lasts for a fairly long time.</li>
            <li>As a former cruise ship employee, im use to original colognes, ...</li>
            <li>Smells GREAT, and just a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, the product is okay.</li>
            <li>i love this stuff, the scent sticks around longer than all my other colognes (around 4-5hrs)</li>
            <li>However, I would highly recommend this, and I will certainly buy this one again.</li>
            <li>Classic cologne that really pulls in compliments.</li>
            <li>I own several colognes that I alternate though the week and, not only is this my favorite, it also last all day.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this cologne on 11/1/2008 and though it does smell like Kenneth Cole Black and is more than likely genuine, the serial number was carved out of the bottom of the bottle.</li>
            <li>As long as he likes it, it is fine by me.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell but not over powering nor long lasting to which I was hoping.</li>
            <li>i love kenneth cole black, since the price on amazon was super low, i ordered from amazon for the first time, athough it smells like the authentic black perfume</li>
            <li>, I only wear it once every month or two (for special times) to conserve it.....</li>
            <li>Really nice, masculine scent (almost a slight hint of banana?)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tough to put fragrances into words, of course, but the Kenneth Cole just seems like a more complete, more finished product.</li>
            <li>It is just strong enough to notice bit far from overpowering.</li>
            <li>But based off other reviews Kenneth Cole Black is supposed to be one of the longest lasting and best cologne on the market.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend it to anyone who likes sweet, tangy scents.</li>
            <li>not a bad fragrance just doesn&#x27;t last  but</li>
            <li>This is my new go-to perfume!</li>
            <li>I usually use in special occasions, when going to a party or important</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the right kind of scent for a man (not a teen), and it&#x27;s long lasting.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of Black.</li>
            <li>Kenneth Cole Black is one of my favorite fragrances because it doesn&#x27;t overpower the senses by drawing all the attention toward you.</li>
            <li>I love kenneth cole black for men.  </li>
            <li>I have enjoyed this cologne (Kenneth Cole BLACK) for about 5 years.</li>
            <li>I think that will be better if I want to smell Kenneth Cole Black</li>
            <li>Whereas I know KC Black is more lingering and stays for a longer time.</li>
            <li>I love Kenneth Cole Black and this does not disappoint.</li>
            <li>I have owned K.C. Black for years and it is my favorite cologne</li>
            <li>This classic is one of my all time favorites.</li>
            <li>Instant compliments in public:)</li>
            <li>I have an active social life, no wife or children, and own between 15 - 20 colognes.</li>
            <li>I gave it 3 stars mainly</li>
            <li>I am particular about the colognes I wear.</li>
            <li>This smells different, the top and the packaging seems off too as compared to my last bottle</li>
            <li>It pairs well with anything from casual to formal apparel and will work well for anyone from the backpack-wearing high school teenager to the \\&quot;most interesting man in the world\\&quot; types.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it is real or not though, the font of the Kenneth Cole looks a bit different but either way, it smells really good.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>and so do I. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I am highly dissatisfied with this product and will never buy cologne from amazon again.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The scent is amazing and different from other brands.</li>
            <li>it should unless you have dry skin.. from taking to many long hot showers..</li>
            <li>I find, when reviewing scents or sprays, it helps to know a little about the person reviewing to get a better idea whether or not the item may suit</li>
            <li>but that does not mean that the smell is gone.</li>
            <li>I was wrong lol.</li>
            <li>It really reminded me of Stetson Preferred Stock that I wore when I was 12 years old.</li>
            <li>Overall, though, it is worth the price to add into your arsonel</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rare to find a scent that would work equally well for Justin Beiber or Antonio Banderas...</li>
            <li>Now that it is only $30, it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Done with the first bottle, ready to order the next!</li>
            <li>*Knock off - complete plastic with an extra lip that requires more uumpf to close and open</li>
            <li>Smells good but not great protection.</li>
            <li>Highly irritated, I tried speaking to customer service using the live chat option.  </li>
            <li>I mean, you&#x27;ll be able to smell it if your VERY close to the person wearing, and by very,</li>
            <li>The price was right, but I would only buy this if you are keeping it for yourself and not giving it to someone else.</li>
            <li>the lettering on the bottle &#x3D;&amp;#62; Original - the dash in front of the Kenneth Cole is &#x27;bolder&#x27; and the &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; in Cole has a closed loop at the top&lt;br</li>
            <li>My boyfriend decided to use a new cologne.  </li>
            <li>I HAVE TO CHECK OUT SOMETHING NEW.</li>
            <li>cuz it  was new in the box when delivered ..</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t return it because i live oversea</li>
            <li>Brand new in box.</li>
            <li>I have been on the search for a new sent for a while now.</li>
            <li>you will not offend anyone at work or out and about.. will last a good 5hrs or a least</li>
            <li>It is not super strong but it lasts 20+ hours</li>
            <li>He loves it and thinks it smells very masculine.</li>
            <li>Very masculine but low-key.</li>
            <li>Had it before and it was fine,but I got either a knockoff or a very old bottle</li>
            <li>I usually bought it from Macy&#x27;s, but now that I found it on here, this has become my new favorite spot.</li>
            <li>Wow a fragrance !</li>
            <li>first smelled this at the mall, didnt buy it, could smell it on my hands later that day, and decided I MUST have it.</li>
            <li>This cologne purchase from Amazon smells exactly the same.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this cologne consistently for the last 8-9 years -</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>is my first only time I will use this service.</li>
            <li>I paid $55 for the same, exact product.  </li>
            <li>Packaging was original and had no problems as some other reviews have stated.</li>
            <li>Generally my KC lasts whole day.</li>
            <li>I use it for office even though it is little strong for it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>generally I like to be a little more</li>
            <li>This has a nice scent when you first put it on and it last all through the day and the smell just becomes a little lighter but still doesn&#x27;t loose that mmmmm smell.  </li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Kenneth Cole Black.</li>
            <li>Of course, if you spray it on heavily, it will be strong.  </li>
            <li>The bottle &amp; sticker on the bottom &#x3D;&amp;#62; Original- Distributed by Lancaster Paris New York NY (with Black - Kenneth Cole logo) and bottle &amp;#34;made in france&amp;#34; emblazoned&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the past, I purchased KC Black from a large retailer and was very satisfied.</li>
            <li>The only downside to this fragrance is in performance – I found that Black lasts on me between 4-6 hours, longer on clothing, at arm’s length or closer, but add this may work out well for an office safe fragrance, though.  </li>
            <li>I love my Kenneth Cole Black ,order the same one over 4 years now ...</li>
            <li>I opened the package it was shipped in and removed the film from the cologne box, first thing I noticed was the box appeared to be a blueish tinge and NOT black (not an alarm because I&#x27;ve had the same bottle for years and don&#x27;t remember what the box looked like).</li>
            <li>After using this a few years back, it came to be my new favorite.</li>
            <li>Smells good but very weak projection and longevity.</li>
            <li>Hugs last a little longer. :)</li>
            <li>I then grabbed my original Black cologne bottle and compared the two, below</li>
            <li>I already have a KC black and this one is no where near the original one.</li>
            <li>lady&#x27;s so far.</li>
            <li>she was surprised when they had it cheaper than what she was gonna pay at dept. store</li>
            <li>you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 23 years old.</li>
            <li>The shipping was exceptionally fast arriving all the way in California only 2-3 days after the item was ordered.</li>
            <li>I like a cologne that last the whole day.</li>
            <li>He is in a wheelchair at 33 years old.  </li>
            <li>Yes I would of paid more but at least it would lives up to its expectations.</li>
            <li>Knock on wood, I have never returned colognes thus far.</li>
            <li>Oh yes it&#x27;s burn on skin if you apply directly on under arms or around neck or on shoulders...</li>
            <li>it really wont be so different whether it is summer or winter.</li>
            <li>I brought with confidence since Amazon was direct seller.</li>
            <li>I REALLY LIKE THE PRODUCT AND IS THE SAME QUALITY</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really describe it, but for me, it gives off this mysterious smell - like if I were to pass someone who was wearing this cologne, I would immediately turn my head around and wonder where in the world he got that cologe.  </li>
            <li>Bought from amazon directly.</li>
            <li>I bought it directly from Amazon</li>
            <li>I just ordered this cologne based on the reviews but the perfume I got was no way near the reviews</li>
            <li>product was really dissapointing, smell lasts only for one hour.</li>
            <li>smell will drive the ladys wild.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t pay close enough attention to realize that it was a much lighter eau de toilette.  </li>
            <li>I feel like a mature man about to take a woman out</li>
            <li>but nowhere near the potency.</li>
            <li>long lasting .. cool perfume</li>
            <li>This scent should be illegal as it smells so good.</li>
            <li>Most other sellers price items high for less quantity.  </li>
            <li>The scent of this cologne is almost as good as Polo Black or Polo Double Black.</li>
            <li>It has a lasting effect that is nice and subtle.</li>
            <li>It was small for the amount of money i spent but the smell was so amazing</li>
            <li>If the performance/sillage were greater, we are talking about a serious competitor in the fragrance market.  </li>
            <li>i would purchase for an older or younger gentlemen.</li>
            <li>It usually runs me 20-25 $ more at local departmental stores.</li>
            <li>I would say it lasted pretty long and goes from a strong scent to a subtle eye opening scent over time.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>back I got him Black as a gift and when he finally ran out, I snapped this up online, thrilled at the low, low price.  </li>
            <li>It has a similar quality smell to Kenneth Cole New York, which was discontinued and also Kenneth Cole RSVP.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this is authentic or if the cologne has gone bad or something, but it isn&#x27;t as good as getting it from a retailer.</li>
            <li>I just randomly selected this fragrance because the price was decent and I loved other selections that Kenneth Cole created.</li>
            <li>I agree with the other positive comments.</li>
            <li>After realizing the smell didn&#x27;t last long at all I started comparing the product i got the the real deal</li>
            <li>the scent didn&#x27;t last as long as the real deal.</li>
            <li>Very musky and long lasting.</li>
            <li>The girlfriend likes this, which is really the only thing that matters in my cologne choice so long as it doesn&#x27;t irritate me.  </li>
            <li>i recommend it for any man  teen, young, old!(even</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I ordered both and spent a few extra dollars for the Kenneth Cole.</li>
            <li>about2 hours... was left in the direct sun here in AZ....</li>
            <li>Now I feel like the cologne is fading faster when he puts it on and barely smells to begin with.</li>
            <li>Sometimes the reviews for certain products can sway your decisions one way or the other.</li>
            <li>I have worn Kenneth Cole Black  by Kenneth Cole for men for years and it never fails, someone always say&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I ordered the 3.4 Oz Kenneth Cole Black cologne and the item came exactly as described.</li>
            <li>but it lasts so much longer than other colognes that I get him.</li>
            <li>Not bad, fragrance was a little above average in my opinion, and had a decent length of time til it was gone.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Spend a little extra money to get the full worth of your hard earned $$.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I had no other cologne and the shipping</li>
            <li>Here are a few ways I learned to tell real perfume/sprays from fake #1 the Kenneth Cole font under Black isn&#x27;t the same as the real deal - the picture given for the product is a picture of the real one, but it doesn&#x27;t match what I received most noticeable is the C in Cole.</li>
            <li>Four stars because it could last a little longer, but it&#x27;s great for a casual date or something.</li>
            <li>Very manly, spicy and dark.</li>
            <li>Initially has a sharp smell to it, but after the dry down, it has a very classy, clean scent.  </li>
            <li>That doesn&#x27;t mean other people won&#x27;t be able to smell it though.</li>
            <li>I really like Kenneth Cole black for Men.</li>
            <li>I took that as the real deal K.C. Black may come in a non box &amp; could be a tester.....</li>
            <li>Works for an everyday scent or for that hot date you want to notice you next Friday night.</li>
            <li>it is not long lasting at all it disappear as soon as you apply on.</li>
            <li>I brought Kenneth Cole Black as a Christmas gift for a family member who really likes the fragrance and wears it regularly!  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that for a cologne of its type, it is a bit mild, but I guess majority would prefer that.</li>
            <li>as I initially ordered this due to the positive reviews on Amazon, usually when a product is rated so high</li>

            <li> The packaging was identical and both were the authentic product.  </li>
            <li> I have to tell you that I was cautioned against buying cologne/perfumes online as often you don&#x27;t receive the authentic product.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>

            <li> All I knew is that it couldn&#x27;t be too strong, because I get migraines really easily with strong scents.  </li>
            <li> Sooo easy.</li>
            <li> But not too strong, yet lasts quite awhile.  </li>

            <li> I never have told my husband that, but it is way too strong in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> Not too tangy and not too strong either.</li>
            <li> Not too strong.</li>
            <li> It gives you a very modern, crisp, and refreshing scent that lasts a good while.</li>
            <li> this is a very captivating fragrance that is very distinctive.</li>
            <li> I was wearing this beautiful fragrance about 10 or 15 years ago and sitting outside of a restaurant.  </li>
            <li> Black is a perfect spray for those who like strong fragrances.</li>
            <li> Great for those romantic occasions very sweet, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I received the Keneth Cole Black by Kenneth Cole for men on time, The product was excellent</li>

            <li> Kenneth Cole Black is an excellent men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> The Kenneth Cole Black by Kenneth Cole for Men is an extremely wonderful product that the scent is welcoming and not overpowerful.  </li>

            <li> but it still smells the same and is a great product.</li>
            <li> This spray smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> It was really fabulous smelling, worked well for my body</li>
            <li> So pretty good for a first date.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine requested that I buy him a new scent, so I got Obsession and Black and allowed him to choose which one he liked best when they arrived.  </li>
            <li> but it has a very fresh feel to it.</li>
            <li> cuz you will go thru the first rather quickly!!</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what I expected and the price was the best we had found after searching.</li>
            <li> Smells very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I loved it since i opened the package, it&#x27;s a strong fragrance with citrics and wooden scents, that gives you that wellness feeling during the day.</li>
            <li> when I was first introduced to this smell, I fell in love with it</li>
            <li> the fragance stays for hours and it seems to be original</li>
            <li> Smells really rich, i should of bought one for myself.</li>
            <li> This was his first time trying Kenneth Cole and we are glad we did it at an affordable price</li>
            <li> And yes this is the original.</li>
            <li> I got this for my fianc&amp;eacute; for Christmas as it is his favorite cologene and reminds us if our first date.</li>
            <li> : I tried many perfumes many brands of different designers, even from Paris, Italy Milano, Lodi L&#x27;arbollario, Zegna, Boss, Gucci and much more..</li>
            <li> I received this order first and when I got it I thought it would be my favorite cologne going forward....</li>
            <li> Smells great and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I got the original product too.</li>
            <li> For the first week it was ok</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> the caps &#x3D;&amp;#62; Original -  plastic with a tin-type shell</li>
            <li> ; Original - awesome&lt;br</li>
            <li> Clean and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Maybe a bit much for work, though a light application would probably be okay.</li>
            <li> Most reviews seems overwhelmingly positive though, so my purchase may have just been a lemon.</li>
            <li> Most of the positive ones are fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent is very clean, crisp and manly.</li>
            <li> By far Amazon&#x27;s price is incomparable !!  </li>
            <li> He was pleasantly surprised and pleased to receive it as a Christmas gift!  </li>
            <li> Becoming a new favorite of mine.  </li>
            <li> It smells great when applied, you loose the smell when you ware it</li>
            <li> Ever since then I have been getting this for him on special occasions when he is close to running out.  </li>
            <li> KCB smells very nice(not too sweet, not too musky) and lasts a lot longer than my Armani Code and is more affordable.</li>
            <li> Omg this is so soft I bought this for my husband just because and let me tell you this smell amazing</li>
            <li> Just lemon smell light that means its not citrus smell citrus smell light orange smell if I&#x27;m not wrong...</li>
            <li> second time I got this because the first time I was so happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Saying this through true experience.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> People pass you by and they turn to say, you smell sweet.</li>
            <li> It has sweet, yet manly odor about it that doesn&#x27;t cause an allergic reaction like some stronger colognes.</li>
            <li> so he would be able to tell if it was the real thing, it was.</li>
            <li> Good for all occasions and would not be likely to offend anyone.  </li>
            <li> I really wouldn&#x27;t say an appropriate work cologne.  </li>
            <li> Now it goes in the collection with my Versace Eros, Giorgio Armani Aqua Di Gio, and Cool Water...</li>
            <li> and he wear it all full day.</li>
            <li> For me this fragrance is too sweet.</li>
            <li> Got such a good deal on this</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and safe.</li>
            <li> What i did notice is that after a few hours the scent becomes softer and more pleasant.</li>
            <li> If one wants to stand out in a crowd without saying a word, this cologne speaks for you; it says that you are confident, bold and value quality and authenticity.</li>
            <li> To reiterate, the price for such a pleasant fragrance is unbeatable and Black would be a great fragrance for those starting to amass a good collection.  </li>
            <li> What i did notice is that after a few hours the scent becomes softer and more pleasant.  </li>
            <li> As advertised, lasts around 3to4 hours on my body then turns into a more \\&quot;fruity\\&quot; smell which actually smells better than the original.  </li>
            <li> It is not overly aromatic after the first 15-20 minutes, but can be easily detected when in close quarters.</li>
            <li> the scent is strong for the first 10-15 mins.</li>
            <li> This is a great place to buy other stuff but not fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that great price and sealed packaging.</li>
            <li> Thus it deserves two stars!...mostly because of the price and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> It had a mild skunk smell.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t fade quickly either.</li>
            <li> so holiday season I had zero life or time - came so quick and just as stated -</li>
            <li> I enjoy this very much, and my wife loves it.</li>
            <li> Nothing special or exciting about it.</li>
            <li> This is a nice clean sent that last all day.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li> smell is mild and fresh scented.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> The item is reasonably priced and ships very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I love this very masculine aroma and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Just wore it the other day and smells AMAZING!</li>
            <li> He used it the first day i gave it to him!</li>
            <li> I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR SURE!</li>
            <li> The product was just as described and was exactly what the photo showed!</li>
            <li> This smells good, clean little sweet, almost like a soapy smell, not unpleasant, for me its a day time scent.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful smell, rich and bold, and lasts a considerably long time compared to other colognes.  </li>
            <li> Hope you enjoy it as much as we do.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t complain it is fabulous really</li>
            <li> It has two distinct scents...alcohol and the flavor you should smell.  </li>
            <li> It was as expected and arrived in good time.</li>
            <li> He liked the smell enough to ask the guy what it was he wore.  </li>
            <li> this is by far one of the better colognes that i have used.</li>
            <li> It had been about 10 yrs since my last gift of cologne from the dear, so I thought I&#x27;d experiment on my own.</li>
            <li> I have been smiled at repeated and complimented several times since I began using this</li>
            <li> So far it gets the attention that many of the reviews have stated.</li>
            <li> Some of my co-workers say they love being near me just to smell me.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite cologne for my husband.</li>
            <li> This is a different kind of oder.  </li>
            <li> The actual product is nice.</li>
            <li> it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I get more attention from the smell of this stuff then most other colognes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottle is very nice and heavy and shiny box that means they invest in bottle and box not for perfume</li>
            <li> I can tell you with 100% certainty I received the genuine product packaged exactly as I bought it at the upscale department store from which I purchased the 2nd bottle for over $20 more.</li>
            <li> Right product, arrived on time.</li>
            <li> dont use right before you are going to meet some one..</li>
            <li> This is just right</li>
            <li> It was delivered right to my doorstep.</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> Just the right smell.</li>
            <li> This cologne can be used right before going to the gym as well as for going on a dinner date.  </li>
            <li> You want to smell sexy, strong, and masculine (not being a stereotype Brute, Aqua Velva, Old Spice wearing stereotype?</li>
            <li> Its a nice fragrance for an evening party, but is a little too strong to be used in the day.</li>
            <li> It is sometimes 2 -3 times more expensive in stores, I will always search it out on Amazon to get an amazing price and have it delivered right to my door :)</li>
            <li> Very fresh smell, for any ocassion and very classy of course !</li>
            <li> Product is great as usual...</li>
            <li> It smells nice and lasts long.</li>
            <li> Super long lasting scent great for work, dress  and leisure.</li>
            <li> product is good, its strong but for some reason I don;t see it lasting long.</li>
            <li> i am a little worried if this is authentic, it&#x27;s sold by amazon so it has to be authentic</li>
            <li> This definately has a strong spicy masculine smell.  </li>
            <li> Kennth Cole Black is a really good value.</li>
            <li> The perfume is good but not what i expected, the reach of the fragrance isn&#x27;t too much.</li>
            <li> they were quick and reasonably priced.. as my daughter says, she loves her smells goods....</li>
            <li> Amazing product, long lasting and gets even better by time.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> What I personally look for in a scent is a strong, manly, yet sweet smell that gets the ladies attention.</li>
            <li> and he loves this very much.</li>
            <li> I got quantity at a price point very reasonable.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am pleased with the product and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good cologne for less than 30 dollars.</li>
            <li> Out of the bottle, the opening of citrus and green notes are easy on the nose that develops into an elegant blend of fresh, spicy, floral and musk notes which make Black easily wearable during any season and for most events.  </li>
            <li> Black smells nice but wears off somewhat quickly and can leave an alcohol after-smell.</li>
            <li> I got compliments sometimes (not always ;))</li>
            <li> This one is my personal favorite.  </li>
            <li> I will always by my perfume/cologne from Amazon, so much cheaper!</li>
            <li> Great product with long lasting scent...</li>
            <li> And exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> He had smelled this on a guy in front of him while waiting to get Hot Wings.  </li>
            <li> 1 Star for packing shipping and filled bottle for full of spirits alcohol mixed with Lemon smell...</li>
            <li> The letterings on the bottle I had purchased from Amazon were different than the ones on the smaller bottle, most notably the letterings for &amp;#34;Kenneth Cole&amp;#34; underneath &amp;#34;BLACK.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Kenneth Cole can do no wrong</li>
            <li> Its exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Product came exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne and I will only buy this one.</li>
            <li> This is my first time placing an order for perfumes from Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> smelling at first but firms up after exposure to the air.</li>
            <li> An instant favorite</li>
            <li> When my mini one runs out, I will buy the larger one that&#x27;s for sure.  </li>
            <li> and it is a real winner in my book!</li>
            <li> Guys, please wear this so women will swoon, it really is intoxicating!</li>
            <li> I have been complimented many times on the fragrance and would definitely purchase it again.  </li>
            <li> He used to wear it when we first met.</li>
            <li> Got many complements from the ladies from work and outside.</li>
            <li> I bought this with out smelling it first</li>
            <li> Sure beats the $80 price tag I found on it in the department store last week.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly as advertised and delivery was speedy.</li>
            <li> My girl loves the smell as have most of my female friends.</li>
            <li> I still have had many compliments on it though regardless of my personal feelings.</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> My first review EVER</li>
            <li> (maybe this is legit legal terms that are in a gray area)!</li>
            <li> this is legit legal terms that are in a gray area)!</li>
            <li> The smells seems a little strong for work and more like for a club, but I don,t go to any clubs</li>
            <li> it got to be watered down its a good cologne to by if your going to get the real thing</li>
            <li> The three I have just listed really leave a \\&quot;YOU\\&quot; statement that stands upright as a classic unique gent when meeting, greeting, and leaving a statement amongst others.</li>
            <li> For$30 less, I was able to get this fantastic cologne.</li>
            <li> Its probably a bit to strong to wear to work, but great to wear on casual nights out.</li>
            <li> Now, the product itself is just amazing, the scent is fresh, young but not too young, I&#x27;m 30 years old</li>
            <li> Wife liked it but not as well as other sprays.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this to give as a gift and it arrived without the original box or cap and is clearly marked \\&quot;tester\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> this best fragment will last long.. even people ask me at work defendly recomed for a date or personal use</li>
            <li> Through most of my important situations, not my everyday cologne though.</li>
            <li> take spirits alcohol mix fresh green lemon juice, smell that on your own risk.</li>
            <li> pretty much all that matters.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an extremely fancy cologne but is perfect for everyday use as it is not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> This has been my favorite cologne for a long time.</li>
            <li> it is a mix of sweet, citrus, with some spicy masculine notes, although i would say it edges toward feminine...</li>
            <li> This is a manly scent good for everyday use!  </li>
            <li> Seriously though, great scent and a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> liked everything about the product except the price which is little bit on the higher side for its category.</li>
            <li> I liked Kenneth Cole Black</li>
            <li> Smell good last long on u</li>
            <li> It really good and long lasting, I will recommend it to people.</li>
            <li> smell great...very strong and lasting scent</li>
            <li> Last a good long time too.</li>
            <li> It smells good, but it does not last long.</li>
            <li> It lasts longer than KC Reaction, but certainly won&#x27;t get you through the day.  </li>
            <li> the top does not latch on to the bottle it just sits loosely on, #3</li>
            <li> It came earlier than expected, new (no tester sticker like some have said), and smells great.</li>
            <li> Thank you, Amazon.com, for carrying such fine and affordable merchandise.</li>
            <li> Very manly.</li>
            <li> Initially it smells like a cheap cologne.</li>
            <li> Very distinctive and outdoorsey.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend also really likes this cologne and therefore I got it.</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> Product scent really goes away after around 3 hours.</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed with the item.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Purchased a bottle and found that it smells very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very citrusy and low-key.</li>
            <li> If you have tastes similar to mine then you will enjoy this.</li>
            <li> As a modern day man.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say much about scent tones, maybe earthy/woody?  </li>
            <li> I am very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Very distinctive and outdoorsey.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon....</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this cologne.</li>
            <li> I got deal before buy 3 get 3 free total 6 for $99</li>
            <li> I just wish I could get a refund and just go buy the real thing...</li>
            <li> not so much like me.</li>
            <li> this really gives me confidence when I talk with some one in close range..</li>
            <li> it lasts for the whole day.</li>
            <li> This the real deal.</li>
            <li> and I do really like it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> so much I ordered two.&lt;br /&gt;Great scent.  </li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say much.</li>
            <li> It was well packaged and delivered real soon...</li>
            <li> It is real and not a knock off.</li>
            <li> Like the name and bottle dont really care for smell.  </li>
            <li> so much I use it sometimes even if I am not going anywhere.  </li>
            <li> is it really affordable</li>
            <li> He loves it, his girlfriend loves it -- for the price, and the ULTRA FAST shipping 4 days before Christmas, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> but if you spray it on your skin instead of your clothes then it will stay on there the whole day.</li>
            <li> It goes really well with leather bags and black/dark clothing.</li>
            <li> IS HOW A MODERN DAY MAN SHOULD SMELL.</li>
            <li> It has a very manly smell.</li>
            <li> To me, it is just as intense as Stetson.  </li>
            <li> Play Intense</li>
            <li> I really like the way it smelled.</li>
            <li> very happy.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Packaged very well to protect the glass bottle.</li>
            <li> I received this cologne as a present about 2 years ago and really enjoy the scent.  </li>
            <li> and I really like the way it smells</li>
            <li> Go to Macy&#x27;s and you&#x27;ll spend too much.</li>
            <li> Thanks amazon for not being unreasonable.</li>
            <li> Having owned this before, I can testify without any doubt that this is the real thing.</li>
            <li> Also much cheaper on amazon than in a department store.</li>
            <li> The perfume is very musky as well as spicy.</li>
            <li> Anywho, I sprayed it and immediately noticed it smelled kiiiiiiiind of like the real thing</li>
            <li> Nice smell, lasts well I use it for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Its such a sexy and masculine scent.</li>
            <li> The last cologne I really liked was Polo Blue.</li>
            <li> He now has a new favorite cologne and it is very inexpensive for such a high quality.</li>
            <li> and I thought this would be a nice gift at a little better price when compared to other retailers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not strong, though is not light at all, it&#x27;s absolutely awesome.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend this cologne for first dates or romantic evenings with that special someone.</li>
            <li> Not too strong, and lasts for a fairly long time.</li>
            <li> As a former cruise ship employee, im use to original colognes, ...</li>
            <li> Smells GREAT, and just a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, the product is okay.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff, the scent sticks around longer than all my other colognes (around 4-5hrs)</li>
            <li> However, I would highly recommend this, and I will certainly buy this one again.</li>
            <li> Classic cologne that really pulls in compliments.</li>
            <li> I own several colognes that I alternate though the week and, not only is this my favorite, it also last all day.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne on 11/1/2008 and though it does smell like Kenneth Cole Black and is more than likely genuine, the serial number was carved out of the bottom of the bottle.</li>
            <li> As long as he likes it, it is fine by me.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell but not over powering nor long lasting to which I was hoping.</li>
            <li> i love kenneth cole black, since the price on amazon was super low, i ordered from amazon for the first time, athough it smells like the authentic black perfume</li>
            <li> , I only wear it once every month or two (for special times) to conserve it.....</li>
            <li> Really nice, masculine scent (almost a slight hint of banana?)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to put fragrances into words, of course, but the Kenneth Cole just seems like a more complete, more finished product.</li>
            <li> It is just strong enough to notice bit far from overpowering.</li>
            <li> But based off other reviews Kenneth Cole Black is supposed to be one of the longest lasting and best cologne on the market.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend it to anyone who likes sweet, tangy scents.</li>
            <li> not a bad fragrance just doesn&#x27;t last  but</li>
            <li> This is my new go-to perfume!</li>
            <li> I usually use in special occasions, when going to a party or important</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the right kind of scent for a man (not a teen), and it&#x27;s long lasting.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Black.</li>
            <li> Kenneth Cole Black is one of my favorite fragrances because it doesn&#x27;t overpower the senses by drawing all the attention toward you.</li>
            <li> I love kenneth cole black for men.  </li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this cologne (Kenneth Cole BLACK) for about 5 years.</li>
            <li> I think that will be better if I want to smell Kenneth Cole Black</li>
            <li> Whereas I know KC Black is more lingering and stays for a longer time.</li>
            <li> I love Kenneth Cole Black and this does not disappoint.</li>
            <li> I have owned K.C. Black for years and it is my favorite cologne</li>
            <li> This classic is one of my all time favorites.</li>
            <li> Instant compliments in public:)</li>
            <li> I have an active social life, no wife or children, and own between 15 - 20 colognes.</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars mainly</li>
            <li> I am particular about the colognes I wear.</li>
            <li> This smells different, the top and the packaging seems off too as compared to my last bottle</li>
            <li> It pairs well with anything from casual to formal apparel and will work well for anyone from the backpack-wearing high school teenager to the \\&quot;most interesting man in the world\\&quot; types.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is real or not though, the font of the Kenneth Cole looks a bit different but either way, it smells really good.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> and so do I. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am highly dissatisfied with this product and will never buy cologne from amazon again.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The scent is amazing and different from other brands.</li>
            <li> it should unless you have dry skin.. from taking to many long hot showers..</li>
            <li> I find, when reviewing scents or sprays, it helps to know a little about the person reviewing to get a better idea whether or not the item may suit</li>
            <li> but that does not mean that the smell is gone.</li>
            <li> I was wrong lol.</li>
            <li> It really reminded me of Stetson Preferred Stock that I wore when I was 12 years old.</li>
            <li> Overall, though, it is worth the price to add into your arsonel</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rare to find a scent that would work equally well for Justin Beiber or Antonio Banderas...</li>
            <li> Now that it is only $30, it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Done with the first bottle, ready to order the next!</li>
            <li> *Knock off - complete plastic with an extra lip that requires more uumpf to close and open</li>
            <li> Smells good but not great protection.</li>
            <li> Highly irritated, I tried speaking to customer service using the live chat option.  </li>
            <li> I mean, you&#x27;ll be able to smell it if your VERY close to the person wearing, and by very,</li>
            <li> The price was right, but I would only buy this if you are keeping it for yourself and not giving it to someone else.</li>
            <li> the lettering on the bottle &#x3D;&amp;#62; Original - the dash in front of the Kenneth Cole is &#x27;bolder&#x27; and the &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; in Cole has a closed loop at the top&lt;br</li>
            <li> My boyfriend decided to use a new cologne.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE TO CHECK OUT SOMETHING NEW.</li>
            <li> cuz it  was new in the box when delivered ..</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t return it because i live oversea</li>
            <li> Brand new in box.</li>
            <li> I have been on the search for a new sent for a while now.</li>
            <li> you will not offend anyone at work or out and about.. will last a good 5hrs or a least</li>
            <li> It is not super strong but it lasts 20+ hours</li>
            <li> He loves it and thinks it smells very masculine.</li>
            <li> Very masculine but low-key.</li>
            <li> Had it before and it was fine,but I got either a knockoff or a very old bottle</li>
            <li> I usually bought it from Macy&#x27;s, but now that I found it on here, this has become my new favorite spot.</li>
            <li> Wow a fragrance !</li>
            <li> first smelled this at the mall, didnt buy it, could smell it on my hands later that day, and decided I MUST have it.</li>
            <li> This cologne purchase from Amazon smells exactly the same.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cologne consistently for the last 8-9 years -</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> is my first only time I will use this service.</li>
            <li> I paid $55 for the same, exact product.  </li>
            <li> Packaging was original and had no problems as some other reviews have stated.</li>
            <li> Generally my KC lasts whole day.</li>
            <li> I use it for office even though it is little strong for it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> generally I like to be a little more</li>
            <li> This has a nice scent when you first put it on and it last all through the day and the smell just becomes a little lighter but still doesn&#x27;t loose that mmmmm smell.  </li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Kenneth Cole Black.</li>
            <li> Of course, if you spray it on heavily, it will be strong.  </li>
            <li> The bottle &amp; sticker on the bottom &#x3D;&amp;#62; Original- Distributed by Lancaster Paris New York NY (with Black - Kenneth Cole logo) and bottle &amp;#34;made in france&amp;#34; emblazoned&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the past, I purchased KC Black from a large retailer and was very satisfied.</li>
            <li> The only downside to this fragrance is in performance – I found that Black lasts on me between 4-6 hours, longer on clothing, at arm’s length or closer, but add this may work out well for an office safe fragrance, though.  </li>
            <li> I love my Kenneth Cole Black ,order the same one over 4 years now ...</li>
            <li> I opened the package it was shipped in and removed the film from the cologne box, first thing I noticed was the box appeared to be a blueish tinge and NOT black (not an alarm because I&#x27;ve had the same bottle for years and don&#x27;t remember what the box looked like).</li>
            <li> After using this a few years back, it came to be my new favorite.</li>
            <li> Smells good but very weak projection and longevity.</li>
            <li> Hugs last a little longer. :)</li>
            <li> I then grabbed my original Black cologne bottle and compared the two, below</li>
            <li> I already have a KC black and this one is no where near the original one.</li>
            <li> lady&#x27;s so far.</li>
            <li> she was surprised when they had it cheaper than what she was gonna pay at dept. store</li>
            <li> you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 23 years old.</li>
            <li> The shipping was exceptionally fast arriving all the way in California only 2-3 days after the item was ordered.</li>
            <li> I like a cologne that last the whole day.</li>
            <li> He is in a wheelchair at 33 years old.  </li>
            <li> Yes I would of paid more but at least it would lives up to its expectations.</li>
            <li> Knock on wood, I have never returned colognes thus far.</li>
            <li> Oh yes it&#x27;s burn on skin if you apply directly on under arms or around neck or on shoulders...</li>
            <li> it really wont be so different whether it is summer or winter.</li>
            <li> I brought with confidence since Amazon was direct seller.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE THE PRODUCT AND IS THE SAME QUALITY</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really describe it, but for me, it gives off this mysterious smell - like if I were to pass someone who was wearing this cologne, I would immediately turn my head around and wonder where in the world he got that cologe.  </li>
            <li> Bought from amazon directly.</li>
            <li> I bought it directly from Amazon</li>
            <li> I just ordered this cologne based on the reviews but the perfume I got was no way near the reviews</li>
            <li> product was really dissapointing, smell lasts only for one hour.</li>
            <li> smell will drive the ladys wild.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t pay close enough attention to realize that it was a much lighter eau de toilette.  </li>
            <li> I feel like a mature man about to take a woman out</li>
            <li> but nowhere near the potency.</li>
            <li> long lasting .. cool perfume</li>
            <li> This scent should be illegal as it smells so good.</li>
            <li> Most other sellers price items high for less quantity.  </li>
            <li> The scent of this cologne is almost as good as Polo Black or Polo Double Black.</li>
            <li> It has a lasting effect that is nice and subtle.</li>
            <li> It was small for the amount of money i spent but the smell was so amazing</li>
            <li> If the performance/sillage were greater, we are talking about a serious competitor in the fragrance market.  </li>
            <li> i would purchase for an older or younger gentlemen.</li>
            <li> It usually runs me 20-25 $ more at local departmental stores.</li>
            <li> I would say it lasted pretty long and goes from a strong scent to a subtle eye opening scent over time.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> back I got him Black as a gift and when he finally ran out, I snapped this up online, thrilled at the low, low price.  </li>
            <li> It has a similar quality smell to Kenneth Cole New York, which was discontinued and also Kenneth Cole RSVP.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is authentic or if the cologne has gone bad or something, but it isn&#x27;t as good as getting it from a retailer.</li>
            <li> I just randomly selected this fragrance because the price was decent and I loved other selections that Kenneth Cole created.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other positive comments.</li>
            <li> After realizing the smell didn&#x27;t last long at all I started comparing the product i got the the real deal</li>
            <li> the scent didn&#x27;t last as long as the real deal.</li>
            <li> Very musky and long lasting.</li>
            <li> The girlfriend likes this, which is really the only thing that matters in my cologne choice so long as it doesn&#x27;t irritate me.  </li>
            <li> i recommend it for any man  teen, young, old!(even</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I ordered both and spent a few extra dollars for the Kenneth Cole.</li>
            <li> about2 hours... was left in the direct sun here in AZ....</li>
            <li> Now I feel like the cologne is fading faster when he puts it on and barely smells to begin with.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the reviews for certain products can sway your decisions one way or the other.</li>
            <li> I have worn Kenneth Cole Black  by Kenneth Cole for men for years and it never fails, someone always say&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I ordered the 3.4 Oz Kenneth Cole Black cologne and the item came exactly as described.</li>
            <li> but it lasts so much longer than other colognes that I get him.</li>
            <li> Not bad, fragrance was a little above average in my opinion, and had a decent length of time til it was gone.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Spend a little extra money to get the full worth of your hard earned $$.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I had no other cologne and the shipping</li>
            <li> Here are a few ways I learned to tell real perfume/sprays from fake #1 the Kenneth Cole font under Black isn&#x27;t the same as the real deal - the picture given for the product is a picture of the real one, but it doesn&#x27;t match what I received most noticeable is the C in Cole.</li>
            <li> Four stars because it could last a little longer, but it&#x27;s great for a casual date or something.</li>
            <li> Very manly, spicy and dark.</li>
            <li> Initially has a sharp smell to it, but after the dry down, it has a very classy, clean scent.  </li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t mean other people won&#x27;t be able to smell it though.</li>
            <li> I really like Kenneth Cole black for Men.</li>
            <li> I took that as the real deal K.C. Black may come in a non box &amp; could be a tester.....</li>
            <li> Works for an everyday scent or for that hot date you want to notice you next Friday night.</li>
            <li> it is not long lasting at all it disappear as soon as you apply on.</li>
            <li> I brought Kenneth Cole Black as a Christmas gift for a family member who really likes the fragrance and wears it regularly!  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that for a cologne of its type, it is a bit mild, but I guess majority would prefer that.</li>
            <li> as I initially ordered this due to the positive reviews on Amazon, usually when a product is rated so high</li>
            <li> I have bought several bottles of Black and just received a new one for Christmas.</li>
            <li> The smell of this perfume is above average but it does not contain any natural oils - only alcohols.</li>
            <li> Since I have bought the same product from a different retailer in the past and the fragrance would last much longer, there is no other reason for me to doubt that Amazon&#x27;s sells the same product but is not exactly comparable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t really last all that long.</li>
            <li> However, the box I received was different than it displayed on the website as smell did not last long.</li>
            <li> It smells just the same but the smell doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> With a lot of colognes now, to me, they don&#x27;t seem to last as long as some of the ones I used when I was younger.</li>
            <li> but it just doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like it too</li>
            <li> Long lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> Last long</li>
            <li> For this reason the smell does not last long.</li>
            <li> Smell don&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> but it does not last long, the max I have seen is 3 hours.</li>
            <li> Refreshes you and is long lasting.</li>
            <li> The scent does not last long.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last long at all.  </li>
            <li> to see if I could return it, but could not due to shipping restrictions due to it containing alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But for some reason, the smell wouldn&#x27;t last even couple hours which I suspect if Amazon receives a different product shipment from Manufacturers which is not the same as what Macys or any other retailers would receive for Fragrances.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it went missing; I quess it was too nice to resist.</li>
            <li> Not trying to sound silly, but in brief words, this a must buy.  </li>
            <li> For a night out, try Gucci intense or gucci guilty intense.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when his Kenneth Cole Black came today.  </li>
            <li> Even though I know the perfume is a fake, its contents are exactly similar to the original.</li>
            <li> But it does last a good 3 hours maybe a little longer, so it guess it isn&#x27;t that bad for the price.</li>
            <li> Lasts reasonably long.  </li>
            <li> long.</li>
            <li> Alittle goes a long way in my opinion.</li>
            <li> , smell stays on a long time</li>
            <li> Fragrance lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to wear this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> Not really a Wow factor on this one....</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t stay long... will not buy again</li>
            <li> I have used this cologne for a long time</li>
            <li> I like it because its smell lasts long time and all my friends like it too.</li>
            <li> for a long time on me</li>
            <li> so I ordered the bottle and it has lasted a long time since I  don&#x27;t use it every day.</li>
            <li> Regardless, Black is a safe blind buy and you will like this fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I find it odd reviewing a cologne scent as this type of thing is very personal and requires a person to actually smell it.  </li>
            <li> It has been several months since I last wore Kenneth Cole’s Black cologne, but was reminded this morning of the pleasantry and beauty of this fragrance.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After that I&#x27;ve flirted with a couple of colognes from CK and a French one, however nothing has been of the same caliber as Black.</li>
            <li> I usually buy him a new bottle for Valentine&#x27;s day.</li>
            <li> The smell didn&#x27;t last as long as his other colognes.</li>
            <li> , the bottle is different, absolutely no print on the bottle!</li>
            <li> It lasts about 6 hours in total with it being almost an even split of blasting fragrance and three hours of dry down aroma.  </li>
            <li> The duration is about average lasting from 4-7 hours.</li>
            <li> The price was a lot less expensive than in the department stores however, I don&#x27;t think the scent is as strong</li>
            <li> Whether you&#x27;re White, Black, or of any race or ethnicity-</li>
            <li> The final tally for Kenneth Cole’s Black is 4.0 stars out of 5.  </li>
            <li> Look at Hugo Boss or Roberto Roberto Cavalli Black if you want something similar.</li>
            <li> I received this bottle and the atomizer was not properly secured to the bottle resulting with my living room carpet smelling like Kenneth Cole Black indefinitely.</li>
            <li> However, if your looking to wear it on a night out, its not strong enough to beat other odors such as smoke, etc.</li>
            <li> Hard to explain the smell but its very close to Glenn Perri Unpredictable Night</li>
            <li> Smells sweet and bottle is a medium should last quite a while if used moderately, too bad is not sold in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> A little on the pricey side in stores, so buying online is definitely the way to go.</li>
            <li> Either way, disappointed in Amazon for shipping a product that they did not check first and WILL BE ALERTING the REAL KENNETH COLE COMPANY.(maybe</li>
            <li> Either way, disappointed in Amazon for shipping a product that they did not check first and WILL BE ALERTING the REAL KENNETH COLE COMPANY.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s really not good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> What can you say about some Kenneth Cole cologne that I purchased for my college aged brother?  </li>
            <li> Product came as described and expected.</li>
            <li> so be careful when ordering online.</li>
            <li> Last year I bout the 1.4 ounce black from Macy&#x27;s for $60+!</li>
            <li> This is double the size for half the price!</li>
            <li> I rank K.C. BLACK just a very small fraction below my 2 other personal faves [Romeo Gigli Man, and Romeo Gigli] (the original green one with the unique wire coiled neck, and maroon ball atop).</li>
            <li> Just a little above average.  </li>
            <li> Not very powerful and doesn&#x27;t have staying power at all.</li>
            <li> I expected more slightly disappointed</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE:  8-8-13  After smelling this cologne a few times now, I am afraid it is too strong for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely picky when it comes to smells.</li>
            <li> this verses any other item.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this in the past as gifts for different family members.</li>
            <li> AS ANY OTHER STORE COULD GIVE YOU ,IAM  </li>
            <li> THIS IS A SEXY SCENT, YOU WON&#x27;T BE DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, items having flammable liquids cannot be returned to Amazon.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected!</li>
            <li> I would say the age range on this is very wide and almost anyone can wear.</li>
            <li> NOT that it would be imitation cologne &amp; in an imitation bottle</li>
            <li> Took long to receive and was not what I expected it was false advertising and did not meet my standards,  I won&#x27;t send it back</li>
            <li> Not for who looks for long lasting at least for 1hour!</li>
            <li> I received the package several days after our anniversary and gave it to him as a late gift.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m wearing dark clothing then this is a cologne I would use along with the likes of Armani Code, YSL and CKbe.</li>
            <li> Hands down pizza taco del king.</li>
            <li> While I won&#x27;t try to break it down in any official capacity, it reminds me of the scent of leather, with a touch of spice.</li>
            <li> And leads me to think some sellers water down the product</li>
            <li> (I know, crazy right?).</li>
            <li> Not wanting to disappoint him I shopped Amazon.com hoping I could afford what he asked for: Kenneth Cole Black.</li>
            <li> slightly musky- NOT fruity..</li>
            <li> was a week and a half wait.</li>
            <li> For that week and a half I had no cologne</li>
            <li> You Wearing &#x27;Black?&#x27; &amp;#34;  I said ye,s</li>
            <li> So I ended up with BLACK.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Kenneth Cole black off and on for years.</li>
            <li> I have always used my brother&#x27;s bottle of kenneth cole black (or acqua di gio).</li>
            <li> Recommend &amp;#34;SEDUCTION IN BLACK</li>
            <li> and you can buy it on Amazon for slightly cheaper than you can in stores.</li>
            <li> ( I purchased my previous bottle from Amazon too and am comparing these side by side).</li>
            <li> Reaction edges this one out, but slightly.</li>
            <li> Maybe I received a dud, but this scent disappears on me within a half hour.</li>
            <li> Try Kenneth Cole Black if you like CK colognes.</li>
            <li> Ordered Kenneth Cole Black without ever trying it previously.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Black by Kenneth Cole is one of my husband&#x27;s favorites.  </li>
            <li> To coin the expression once you go black...</li>
            <li> I am not a super fan of this fragrance</li>
            <li> Not cool.</li>
            <li> I also wear Gucci Black, The One by Jay-Z, Yves St. Laurent, Tommy Bahama, and a few others.  </li>
            <li> It was not a genuine product and the smell lasted less than an hour post application</li>
            <li> The sale price for the larger size bottle made the Kenneth Cole Black quite a bargain and a tough deal to beat in men&#x27;s colognes.</li>
            <li> Not sure why other people reviews these products as knockoffs.</li>
            <li> If they are teenagers that like to dressup for school or other fuctions, just tell them not to go overboard with the spraying.</li>
            <li> I think its not original</li>
            <li> It does come off a little &amp;#34;alcohol&amp;#34;ish</li>
            <li> a little disapointed.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s birthday is a few days before Christmas so money is tight for both of us.</li>
            <li> It got me quite a few compliments.</li>
            <li> I receive quite a few complements  </li>
            <li> I wear it year round.</li>
            <li> and I wear it almost everyday</li>
            <li> This is my everyday use cologne.</li>
            <li> It is now my go-to scent for everyday usage.</li>
            <li> In fact, after I few minutes, you won&#x27;t even know you have this on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times, around work, around friends, and even on a few dates.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gotten quite a few complements on the nights that I&#x27;ve worn it.</li>
            <li> Since I didn&#x27;t want to waste away money on a cologne that could be a bust (like the Nautica ones), I decided to go off with the mini version of this through Fragrance.net.  </li>
            <li> A few compliments.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy with a touch of citrus.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> *Knock off - eh after a few squirts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I did not hugely like the powdery smell (and that&#x27;s why I took one star off).</li>
            <li> and theres a very slight alcohol singe that adds that little bit of bitterness I mentioned.</li>
            <li> Plain and lemon / citrus scented.  </li>
            <li> still like Amazon, but the dealer that supplies this apparently has a few bottles of the fake stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> (Ralph Lauren Polo Green) and past colognes</li>
            <li> I was desperate to get my husband to try a new fragrance since he was still stuck in the 90 with Safari.  </li>
            <li> obvious fake don&#x27;t waste your time with this 1 guys n gals</li>
            <li> I am a lover of Calvin Klein Eternity for Men and would rate KC Black secondary to Eternity.</li>
            <li> Did make me a little concerned about the quality of the product though!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry don&#x27;t like this product from this vendor, very disappointed, much better eternity for men by CK.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is seriously watered down and the scent goes away after a minute or</li>
            <li> i am big on colognes for my husband as well as he is, i think he told me he likes it just because he didn&#x27;t want me to feel bad after buying it, however i can tell he does not fancies it due to him wearing it less loll.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every day for the past three years and it still hasn&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> My husband  wears cologne every day and usually chooses this one.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how to write a review about a cologne.</li>
            <li> Have not used this one in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure if Kenneth Cole even makes it anymore</li>
            <li> Im the girlfriend of a Kenneth Cole Black wearer!!</li>
            <li> and I could continue to smell it faintly all day long.</li>
            <li> this i my #2 behind polo black.</li>
            <li> This perfume stay on your clothes or body till 30minutes hardly...</li>
            <li> so it is hard to describe.  </li>
            <li> and now it is hardly functional.</li>
            <li> this one realy sucks, looks like its not</li>
            <li> I get complimented on this cologne at least once a day.</li>
            <li> No one has complained about it being over powering.</li>
            <li> Every time I take at least 3 girls home.</li>
            <li> One thing I learnt about amazon is that you always have to trust the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> I mean, like, hugging.</li>
            <li> The only thing that is annoying is that mail law/regulations slow down the shipping  -</li>
            <li> Serious doubts about the authenticity of this product.</li>
            <li> Not good</li>
            <li> I was sad to see that they stopped carrying this at Sephora inside JCP where I usually buy it.</li>
            <li> very common smell..</li>
            <li> it for long time &amp; never been disappointed</li>
            <li> I put one spray behind the each ear.</li>
            <li> My poor hubby...</li>
            <li> and unfortunately i had to get him another one.</li>
            <li> and it is clearly fake</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t choke u or anybody else and lasts really wrong.</li>
            <li> You smell yourself when you put this on and it is not that expensive.</li>
            <li> Seemed like a fake to me</li>
            <li> dont think you can wear this fragrance for the walk at the beach or casual sundays, though (without being weird)</li>
            <li> smell like fake one and regretting buying it.</li>
            <li> so tampering is unlikely.</li>
            <li> I guess the one that I got was a fake one.</li>
            <li> I think is a fake one,</li>
            <li> I am going to be one sad man when I can&#x27;t find this anymore.  </li>
            <li> Fake don&#x27;t waist your money over this.</li>
            <li> I was worried that I was going to get a fake, but all packaging was intact and legit.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t smell how it did in the store, this is maybe a fake.</li>
            <li> I was very confused about ordering because whenever i read reviews of fragrances there always are some ppl claiming that they got fake ones.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Kenneth Cole Black, how can it be wrong!!!</li>
            <li> Not too overpowering and not cheap and nasty like Axe smells.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the dirty laundry basket&#x27;</li>
            <li> Every desperate guy should buy this.</li>
            <li> With these 3 in your arsenal (in my opinion)you cannot go wrong!</li>
            <li> you cannot go wrong with Kenneth Cole!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Too bad.</li>
            <li> Bad deal.</li>
            <li> It was my bad...</li>
            <li> He wears Stetson and frankly, I am sick to death of Stetson.  </li>
            <li> I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> So disappointed with Amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought this one and was slightly disappointed.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again. :(  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find out that cologne was an item that amazon does not accept as a return.</li>
            <li> What I really hate in a scent is it being overly \\&quot;tangy\\&quot; or too citrusy/bitter.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very disappointed how smell this product</li>
            <li> THE WORST PERFUME I EVER BOUGHT!</li>

            <li> Sorta almost generic smelling but not, but neutral enough not to offend anybody&#x27;s personal space.</li>
            <li> It got me quite a few compliments.</li>
            <li> My favorite men&#x27;s fragrance. Best price I have found.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Black. Everybody keeps asking me what cologne I&#x27;m wearing because it smells so soooooo good.</li>
            <li> Great cologne....love the smell...many compliments from people..highly recommend!</li>

            <li> Wow a fragrance ! Can&#x27;t find a word to explain&lt;br /&gt;How sophisticated this perfume is.lady&#x27;s goes&lt;br /&gt;Nuts about the wonderful smell it spreads.been&lt;br /&gt;Using it for long time &amp; never been disappointed&lt;br /&gt;With  lady&#x27;s so far. Hey fellas u know how&lt;br /&gt;Iron &amp; magnet works. This product will work the&lt;br /&gt;Same. Saying this through true experience.&lt;br /&gt;- (Kevin Islam)</li>
            <li> Good my Grand son liked it.</li>
            <li> This is some GREAT cologne, my favorite by far.</li>
            <li> I find it odd reviewing a cologne scent as this type of thing is very personal and requires a person to actually smell it.  I know that I wouldn&#x27;t buy a cologne based on someone else&#x27;s review simply because it&#x27;s a personal taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;-Light refreshing scent&lt;br /&gt;-High quality&lt;br /&gt;-Fast delivery&lt;br /&gt;-Delivered in perfect condition&lt;br /&gt;-MUCH CHEAPER THAN RETAIL!!  - At Macy&#x27;s this product sells for $89.00 before tax, I got it for under $30.00 here on Amazon with shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps....</li>
            <li> my son had wanted some for his birthday. My daughter was going to purchase it when i seen it on Amazon. she was surprised when they had it cheaper than what she was gonna pay at dept. store</li>
            <li> Initially it smells like a cheap cologne. It has two distinct scents...alcohol and the flavor you should smell.  After 4 or so hours, the alcohol smell fades away and you start to smell good.  Thus it deserves two stars!...mostly because of the price and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend decided to use a new cologne.  It isn&#x27;t my favorite.  I prefer his John Varvatos cologne.</li>
            <li> I own over 20 EDTs, and this is quite possibly my favorite.  Initially has a sharp smell to it, but after the dry down, it has a very classy, clean scent.  It could be worn any time of year - day or evening.  The only drawback would be that the longivity isnt quite great.  It lasts longer than KC Reaction, but certainly won&#x27;t get you through the day.  However, I would highly recommend this, and I will certainly buy this one again.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne without knowing it but I don&#x27;t regret at all cause I loved it! and for it&#x27;s price it&#x27;s a great value!</li>
            <li> Black is a perfect spray for those who like strong fragrances. I got compliments sometimes (not always ;)) when I used this product. I use it for office even though it is little strong for it.&lt;br /&gt;I liked everything about the product except the price which is little bit on the higher side for its category.</li>
            <li> I just love this perfume. People pass you by and they turn to say, you smell sweet.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This one is my personal favorite.  I use this cologne to work some times and I always get compliments on how good it smells.  Girls really love the scent and I would highly recommend this cologne for first dates or romantic evenings with that special someone.</li>
            <li> Kenneth Cole Black is one of my favorite fragrances because it doesn&#x27;t overpower the senses by drawing all the attention toward you. It has sweet, yet manly odor about it that doesn&#x27;t cause an allergic reaction like some stronger colognes. Works for an everyday scent or for that hot date you want to notice you next Friday night.</li>
            <li> Amaze-balls. I get complimented on this cologne at least once a day. Hugs last a little longer. :)</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchases.</li>
            <li> This cologne is original and absolutely nice. Unfortunately, it went missing; I quess it was too nice to resist. Undoubtedly, it must be replaced. No substitute will do. My husband loves it.More importantly, I love how it smells on him. Well done Kenneth Cole</li>
            <li> Great product for the price. My product was delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my best friend as a Christmas gift. It smells amazing. He&#x27;s used it for years so he would be able to tell if it was the real thing, it was. Highly recommended. Shipped a lot faster than I thought it would.</li>
            <li> The product arrived and the lid was faulty.  The spray part would not come out and after being opened once the bottle refused to close.  I logged on and attempted to return it but noted that colognes can&#x27;t be returned.  Highly irritated, I tried speaking to customer service using the live chat option.  Within 10 minutes I had a response and was informed my replacement was on its way.  Naturally I havn&#x27;t received it yet, but assuming it arrives - BRILLIANT service from Amazon.  Did make me a little concerned about the quality of the product though!  Anywaz, smells good!</li>
            <li> I bought this scent for my husband and I love it!  He loves it because I do, and it is pleasant to him as well.  Definitely recommend it to anyone who likes sweet, tangy scents. Very romantic.</li>
            <li> Smell good last long on u</li>
            <li> Wife liked it but not as well as other sprays.  Overall, though, it is worth the price to add into your arsonel</li>
            <li> IT WAS JUST WHAT I NEEDED</li>
            <li> Whether you&#x27;re White, Black, or of any race or ethnicity- you&#x27;ll like it.  Very distinctive and outdoorsey. What i did notice is that after a few hours the scent becomes softer and more pleasant. I would not recommend this...</li>
            <li> Not bad, fragrance was a little above average in my opinion, and had a decent length of time til it was gone.  Just a little above average.  Solid product.</li>
            <li> My friend used this and it smells good. My girlfriend also really likes this cologne and therefore I got it. I like the smell and it lasts a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every day for the past three years and it still hasn&#x27;t run out. LOL. All my friends love the scent too.</li>
            <li> The perfume was good I really enjoy the fragrant . I really like Kenneth Cole black for Men. Eau De Toilette</li>
            <li> Got this cologne for my boyfriend. Smells great &amp; such an affordable price. I will always by my perfume/cologne from Amazon, so much cheaper!</li>
            <li> This classic is one of my all time favorites. It goes well with just about anything in any situation and is sure to get you noticed. It pairs well with anything from casual to formal apparel and will work well for anyone from the backpack-wearing high school teenager to the \\&quot;most interesting man in the world\\&quot; types. It&#x27;s rare to find a scent that would work equally well for Justin Beiber or Antonio Banderas... This cologne also will actually attract attention like the (in)famous Axe commercials - I have yet to wear it out and not get a compliment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon had this for a great price, so I stocked up.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s birthday is a few days before Christmas so money is tight for both of us. Not wanting to disappoint him I shopped Amazon.com hoping I could afford what he asked for: Kenneth Cole Black. Indeed, we both got what we wanted!! I saved lots of money and he received his favorite cologne. Thank you, Amazon.com, for carrying such fine and affordable merchandise.</li>
            <li> It really good and long lasting, I will recommend it to people. It lasted for about 5 hours in every use</li>
            <li> Im the girlfriend of a Kenneth Cole Black wearer!! lol My boyfriend wears this and this is the cologne he had on when we met and I have to say I WANTED TO ATTACK THIS MAN!!:) This is the best smelling stuff!! You want to get close to someone and get some attention, put this stuff on!! I suggest you buy two cuz you will go thru the first rather quickly!!</li>
            <li> A very good perfume..and excellent given the cost of it. I love the woody fragrance of it ....amazing. I always keep a bottle of it !!!!!</li>
            <li> when I was first introduced to this smell, I fell in love with it, it&#x27;s great and will wear it in between all the others I use... thanks.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it and so do I. It has a lasting effect that is nice and subtle. It is not overly aromatic after the first 15-20 minutes, but can be easily detected when in close quarters. I have bought several bottles of Black and just received a new one for Christmas. Hope you enjoy it as much as we do.</li>
            <li> Got this for my stepdad and he and mom both loved it. She said he&#x27;s not allowed to wear it outside the house b/c the ladies will be all over him, LOL.</li>
            <li> Not that happy with this scent. I liked the original but couldn&#x27;t find it so I settled on this one. My wife isn&#x27;t happy with it either which means that I probably won&#x27;t be wearing it very often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad.</li>
            <li> The scent is awesome and lasts until you wash it off. My husband is just that much more irresistible when he wears this cologne :)</li>
            <li> just came like looks in the picture,&lt;br /&gt;they make a good box package to keep it safe,&lt;br /&gt;looks original to me and smells perfect.</li>
            <li> Great product with long lasting scent... Instant compliments in public:) By far Amazon&#x27;s price is incomparable !!  I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 5 yrs now and the aroma still amazes me with every squirt !!  A MUST !!!!!!</li>
            <li> Product scent really goes away after around 3 hours. It smells amazing for 3 hours but man i wanna smell like that a lil bit longer but it dosen&#x27;t so instead i&#x27;ll need to shove fire ants inside my pooper. Hands down pizza taco del king. Ding a Ling. Ring Ring Ding Dong.</li>
            <li> Its a nice fragrance for an evening party, but is a little too strong to be used in the day.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to give as a gift and it arrived without the original box or cap and is clearly marked \\&quot;tester\\&quot;. Not cool.</li>
            <li> On the description of this item it never said that it was a tester. It was going to be a gift for my dad and unfortunately i had to get him another one. This item didnt come with the cap no box like is presented on the picture. Very dissapointed with the item.</li>
            <li> My daughter recommended this collage to me. When I searched the net I found it at Amazon for the best price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased a bottle and found that it smells very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I receive quite a few complements  when wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I would recommend it to others</li>
            <li> Turns out, not only was this bottle priced out of this world, but I got the gift set to boot!!! which is does not even mention!!! Talk about a bonus score!!! And still one of the best scents around to make the ladies squeal with delight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You rock amazon!!!!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the cologne for my husband. It smells wonderful on him. I am also happy with the price that you all sold it for. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;Whispering Eagle Casteel</li>
            <li> Excellent!! I love it.!!! Is the third time I have one of this. Surely a must.</li>
            <li> if the wife likes it, i like it!</li>
            <li> Becoming a new favorite of mine.  Wife likes it too - that makes it easier.</li>
            <li> Really nice, masculine scent (almost a slight hint of banana?) that does not smell like everything else on the market. I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> It was small for the amount of money i spent but the smell was so amazing everytime my boyfriend wears it i want to jump his bones...</li>
            <li> This fragrance is one of my favorite, it works well with a tux or a pair of jeans. Very citrusy and low-key. I use it year-round.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loves it on me therefore I love it.  I also wear Gucci Black, The One by Jay-Z, Yves St. Laurent, Tommy Bahama, and a few others.  If you have tastes similar to mine then you will enjoy this.</li>
            <li> Purchased for husband- smells like you would expect a man to smell...slightly musky- NOT fruity.. I love it. Not too overpowering and not cheap and nasty like Axe smells. I think this is a great cologne.</li>
            <li> If one wants to stand out in a crowd without saying a word, this cologne speaks for you; it says that you are confident, bold and value quality and authenticity.</li>
            <li> Showed up on time. And exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> It is a nice spray. i like the smell and I also bought one for my dad. Nice gift. I get compliments from the ladies with this one.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my boyfriend for a Christmas gift and he loves it! Its smells great, i like it too! He used it the first day i gave it to him! It was packaged all nice and pretty! He even says people noticed how good he smelled (its like a lady magnet XD) great service! A+++ i recommend it for any man  teen, young, old!(even my dad has a bottle)and it was for a great price too :p</li>
            <li> This is great, thank you  amazing</li>
            <li> Great scent just wish it would last longer</li>
            <li> This is it. Women love this.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne. I was sad to see that they stopped carrying this at Sephora inside JCP where I usually buy it. I was happy to find it here and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I love kenneth cole black for men.  The fragrance is appealing to all,  I make sure I keep a bottle in my stock of cologne.</li>
            <li> Great scent, great seller, excellent</li>
            <li> Plain and lemon / citrus scented.  Not too impressed.</li>
            <li> It was not a genuine product and the smell lasted less than an hour post application</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely picky when it comes to smells. A cologne reflects who I am, and the way I want to be perceived by others... As a modern day man. But I was at the dept store and I saw this and tried it. Gentlemen this is a must have cologne. It&#x27;s not strong, though is not light at all, it&#x27;s absolutely awesome. You&#x27;ll get ladies attention lol PD: it ran me like 30 bucks more in the store .-my son</li>
            <li> Good value for the amount of cologne. Buying in bulk is always cheaper. The scent of this cologne is almost as good as Polo Black or Polo Double Black.</li>
            <li> I find, when reviewing scents or sprays, it helps to know a little about the person reviewing to get a better idea whether or not the item may suit you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 23 years old. I trade the stock market during the day, and am a bartender on week nights / weekends. I have an active social life, no wife or children, and own between 15 - 20 colognes. What I personally look for in a scent is a strong, manly, yet sweet smell that gets the ladies attention. What I really hate in a scent is it being overly \\&quot;tangy\\&quot; or too citrusy/bitter. An example of a cologne I LOVE would be Ambercrombie: Fierce. An example of a cologne I dislike would be \\&quot;Usher\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first smelled this at the mall, didnt buy it, could smell it on my hands later that day, and decided I MUST have it. This cologne can easily be found in almost any department so I doubt anyone will have issues of buying without knowing what to expect. My opinion of a perfect cologne is 40% \\&quot;sweet\\&quot;, 50% \\&quot;manly\\&quot;, 10% \\&quot;bitter\\&quot;. I believe this cologne here comes as close to that ratio as any Ive ever smelled. It has a nice \\&quot;cool\\&quot; aspect that women typically enjoy without being too \\&quot;sweet\\&quot; or feminine. That man-ness is definitely there and theres a very slight alcohol singe that adds that little bit of bitterness I mentioned. Truly an almost perfect balance of scents. I would say the age range on this is very wide and almost anyone can wear. The duration is about average lasting from 4-7 hours. A little on the pricey side in stores, so buying online is definitely the way to go.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and I love how it smells on him. This is one of my favorite cologne on him besides Gucci. Smells freaken sexy.</li>
            <li> My sons cologne band.......I buy it for him every year amazon has a very good price and I would recommend this to any one not to heavy great smell!~</li>
            <li> Delivery was prompt and the cologne smells great! Got it for my boyfriend&#x27;s Christmas present. He loves it and thinks it smells very masculine.</li>
            <li> It was as expected and arrived in good time.</li>
            <li> This smells good, clean little sweet, almost like a soapy smell, not unpleasant, for me its a day time scent.</li>
            <li> This is such a great cologne.  I was desperate to get my husband to try a new fragrance since he was still stuck in the 90 with Safari.  He had smelled this on a guy in front of him while waiting to get Hot Wings.  He liked the smell enough to ask the guy what it was he wore.  Ever since then I have been getting this for him on special occasions when he is close to running out.  Finding it at such a great price was a steal.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Has a very clean scent.  Lasts reasonably long.  Good for all occasions and would not be likely to offend anyone.  A solid scent to go along with my mainstays of Chrome, Chrome Legend, Touch.</li>
            <li> Cheap and efficient (good price for size). Smells great and well presented. Nothing to complain about here&lt;br /&gt;I actually would recommend buying the larger size</li>
            <li> this is my favorite cologne of all time, kenneth cole as always has perfect and original scents for men&#x27;s cologne, i will buy this cologne again and again...</li>
            <li> I have worn Kenneth Cole Black  by Kenneth Cole for men for years and it never fails, someone always say&#x27;s; you smell so good, and always wants to know the name. I wear it year round. It is my final touch after my shower in the morning and it last all day. Girls love it!</li>
            <li> Very good product and very recommended for going out at nights the fragance stays for hours and it seems to be original the box came with a code.</li>
            <li> I knew it smelled great already.  Clean and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> It has been several months since I last wore Kenneth Cole’s Black cologne, but was reminded this morning of the pleasantry and beauty of this fragrance.  Definitely underrated and given the modesty in price, comes with a solid recommendation to add to anyone’s collection.  Out of the bottle, the opening of citrus and green notes are easy on the nose that develops into an elegant blend of fresh, spicy, floral and musk notes which make Black easily wearable during any season and for most events.  The only downside to this fragrance is in performance – I found that Black lasts on me between 4-6 hours, longer on clothing, at arm’s length or closer, but add this may work out well for an office safe fragrance, though.  To reiterate, the price for such a pleasant fragrance is unbeatable and Black would be a great fragrance for those starting to amass a good collection.  The final tally for Kenneth Cole’s Black is 4.0 stars out of 5.  If the performance/sillage were greater, we are talking about a serious competitor in the fragrance market.  Regardless, Black is a safe blind buy and you will like this fragrance.  Enjoy your day and happy fragrance hunting…</li>
            <li> Bought this for my Dad, he&#x27;s  cologne person and he loves this very much. Smells really rich, i should of bought one for myself.</li>
            <li> this is by far one of the better colognes that i have used. i use only this brand for regular use.</li>
            <li> The ladies like it.  I can&#x27;t really say much about scent tones, maybe earthy/woody?  But not too strong, yet lasts quite awhile.  And, have gotten many compliments from the ladies.</li>
            <li> I received the Keneth Cole Black by Kenneth Cole for men on time, The product was excellent I do not have any kind of complain. I should buy again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was a product error or what, but my husband has been wearing this brand for a couple of years. I received the package several days after our anniversary and gave it to him as a late gift. He thanked me, opened it up and sprayed it. It had a mild skunk smell. I was so disappointed. I thought I was getting a deal by ordering it online instead of going to the store but I will not do that again. It smelled nothing like the brand I buy from Macy&#x27;s. I am very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> This is a nice clean sent that last all day. More like something you would wear at night to a club. Hard to explain the smell but its very close to Glenn Perri Unpredictable Night</li>
            <li> I received the cologne within 3 days of order date, much earlier then the delivery date.&lt;br /&gt;It was in it&#x27;s original packing, the box was unopened and the cologne has a great smell good for both day and night-time wear.</li>
            <li> I got this EDT after reading all the good reviews. It last morning to evening and I am happy about that. But I did not hugely like the powdery smell (and that&#x27;s why I took one star off).</li>
            <li> Not my favorite cologne.  This definately has a strong spicy masculine smell.  Some men may prefer it.  I really wouldn&#x27;t say an appropriate work cologne.  Better for romance .  Although like I said it has a strong smell.  Very distinctive and outdoorsey.  What i did notice is that after a few hours the scent becomes softer and more pleasant.  I would not recommend this cologne unless you prefer the spicy scents.</li>
            <li> Based on quality and what tends to be liked by others whenever used. This would definitely be a product to try.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne! I bought it for my husband who smells great now!  highly recommended and very,  very sexy!</li>
            <li> It is my nefew&#x27;s favorite!</li>
            <li> Right product, arrived on time. The gift recipient was pleased with both the smell and the size. This was his first time trying Kenneth Cole and we are glad we did it at an affordable price</li>
            <li> This is one sexy smelling men&#x27;s colgne...I get more comments from women about this cologne that any cologne I have ever wore..it does have a very distinctive exciting pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best fragrances I have ever owned. The price on amazon.com was just too good to miss. No need to think twice, BUY IT!</li>
            <li> Definitely buy this product! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I had no other cologne and the shipping was a week and a half wait. For that week and a half I had no cologne but if you have a back up one and your getting low definitely invest in this. Last year I bout the 1.4 ounce black from Macy&#x27;s for $60+! This is double the size for half the price! And yes this is the original.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend gave me this. It smells nice and lasts long.</li>
            <li> Missed this cologne, great to be able and purchase at such a good price. Will be browsing for more colognes.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this cologne (Kenneth Cole BLACK) for about 5 years. I rank K.C. BLACK just a very small fraction below my 2 other personal faves [Romeo Gigli Man, and Romeo Gigli] (the original green one with the unique wire coiled neck, and maroon ball atop). With these 3 in your arsenal (in my opinion)you cannot go wrong! You want to smell sexy, strong, and masculine (not being a stereotype Brute, Aqua Velva, Old Spice wearing stereotype? The three I have just listed really leave a \\&quot;YOU\\&quot; statement that stands upright as a classic unique gent when meeting, greeting, and leaving a statement amongst others. Buy it! You wont regret it!</li>
            <li> I ordered the 3.4 Oz Kenneth Cole Black cologne and the item came exactly as described. The shipping was exceptionally fast arriving all the way in California only 2-3 days after the item was ordered. The item is 100% authentic and I could not be more pleased with the purchase. Oh and by the way, I selected standard 8-14 day shipping and the item still arrived in two days. Awesome!!!!!</li>
            <li> After not knowing what to get my brother for his birthday, I found this product and decided to try it out. I saw that the price was right and the amount was good for the asking price. I selected the 5-8 day shipping and it got there within 2-3 days!!! It was amazing and my brother loved the spray! I am glad I decided to go with this verses any other item. Couldn&#x27;t be more happy!</li>
            <li> Smells great,but only last for an hour. I like a cologne that last the whole day. Would never purchase this fragrance again.</li>
            <li> the citric essence.. Smells really good.. but doesnot stay for more than 12 hours. i think its good and worth its price</li>
            <li> Outstanding fragrance. Not too &#x27;perfumey&#x27;. Gerat price when purchased as deal of the day (love the deal of the day!)</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents! Great for those romantic occasions very sweet, but not overpowering. And it lasts for along time!</li>
            <li> This cologne definitely ups your sex appeal. You will be turning heads while you wear this, making hunnies wanna get in a lil closer.</li>
            <li> this product is a great value, price is great and smells wonderful on. Could not be more pleased, love it on.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne for my nephew.  It is his favorite. This was a present for his birthday.  The price could not be beat. He is in a wheelchair at 33 years old.  This gift made his day...Thanks Amazon....</li>
            <li> I love it!! Very good fragrance. I will recommend to any person.</li>
            <li> I heard so many good things about this and had high hopes.  I should of just purchased this product from the mall. Yes I would of paid more but at least it would lives up to its expectations. After realizing the smell didn&#x27;t last long at all I started comparing the product i got the the real deal and it did not match.  Here are a few ways I learned to tell real perfume/sprays from fake #1 the Kenneth Cole font under Black isn&#x27;t the same as the real deal - the picture given for the product is a picture of the real one, but it doesn&#x27;t match what I received most noticeable is the C in Cole. #2 the top does not latch on to the bottle it just sits loosely on, #3 the scent didn&#x27;t last as long as the real deal.</li>
            <li> He absolutely loved it!</li>
            <li> I have worn this in the years of bar hopping and clubbing. Through most of my important situations, not my everyday cologne though. Not because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s not the best, but I feel it should be used on a special occasion. Very easy going,smooth blended with some style. This is a purchase I will make the rest of my life. Just ordered another bottle, what are you waiting for?</li>
            <li> This is quickly becoming one of my favorites... it has a great smell that is not overpowering...it is a mix of sweet, citrus, with some spicy masculine notes, although i would say it edges toward feminine... this is the kind of perfume that girls would like to smell on you but you will not find impressive yourself... i see it best to wear on a date or at night... it is not something for work...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the fragrance that is given off by this cologne. I just randomly selected this fragrance because the price was decent and I loved other selections that Kenneth Cole created. I&#x27;m glad I took a chance, it smells great!!!!</li>
            <li> Kennth Cole Black is a really good value. KCB smells very nice(not too sweet, not too musky) and lasts a lot longer than my Armani Code and is more affordable.</li>
            <li> Nice sexy smell.  This has a nice scent when you first put it on and it last all through the day and the smell just becomes a little lighter but still doesn&#x27;t loose that mmmmm smell.  One of my favorites.</li>
            <li> This spray last all&lt;br /&gt;Day long. I life the smell, and everyone else dose 2! I would wear this in the morning an 2 days later can still smell it I&#x27;m the dirty laundry basket&#x27; lol</li>
            <li> This product will turn head as u walk by emitting a cool pleasant scent for an eye opening price. Good choice</li>
            <li> The product was good and the size met expectation. I have no doubt it is the original as the smell is good my Husband loves it.</li>
            <li> Even though I know the perfume is a fake, its contents are exactly similar to the original. I like the smell and feel of it.</li>
            <li> I rated this 5 stars becuase I really like the smell of this cologne. Sometimes the reviews for certain products can sway your decisions one way or the other. I purchased this cologne over 2 yrs ago from another site and loved the smell then. This cologne purchase from Amazon smells exactly the same. Not sure why other people reviews these products as knockoffs. I hope i dont come across any in the future. It angers me when I have to return a product. Knock on wood, I have never returned colognes thus far. i would purchase for an older or younger gentlemen. If they are teenagers that like to dressup for school or other fuctions, just tell them not to go overboard with the spraying. Alittle goes a long way in my opinion.</li>
            <li> smell great...very strong and lasting scent</li>
            <li> I LIKE IT BUT, WILL NOT BUY IT AGAIN.  WILL TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT NEXT TIME.  I HAVE TO CHECK OUT SOMETHING NEW.</li>
            <li> after purchasing this item and having the UPS guy leave it on my step someone stole it and i never got my item on time.&lt;br /&gt;i had it reshipped and was able to give as a gift! smell is pretty good, good for going out at night, smell stays on a long time</li>
            <li> I have been using  for a couple of years and love it !!!!  I usually use in special occasions, when going to a party or important events.&lt;br /&gt;It smells AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li> Violates Altoqati dislike</li>
            <li> Omg this is so soft I bought this for my husband just because and let me tell you this smell amazing it stay with you all day..... I would strongly recommend this product you want regret it</li>
            <li> Nice price for this good smelling stuff</li>
            <li> This is my son&#x27;s favorite cologne. He will not wear anything else. It is sometimes 2 -3 times more expensive in stores, I will always search it out on Amazon to get an amazing price and have it delivered right to my door :)</li>
            <li> Just got mines and it is nothing like the picture above the letters are different ,labels on box and bottle look to have been painted on no serial number on bottle..obvious fake don&#x27;t waste your time with this 1 guys n gals</li>
            <li> It had been about 10 yrs since my last gift of cologne from the dear, so I thought I&#x27;d experiment on my own. (I know, crazy right?). I ordered this Kenneth Cole at the same time as Nautica Voyage, which was on sale. I&#x27;m glad I ordered both and spent a few extra dollars for the Kenneth Cole. It&#x27;s tough to put fragrances into words, of course, but the Kenneth Cole just seems like a more complete, more finished product. It&#x27;s the right kind of scent for a man (not a teen), and it&#x27;s long lasting.</li>
            <li> Have been and always will be a Kenneth Cole fan. Its Potent, refined and easily recognizable to anyone who&#x27;s experienced it before</li>
            <li> i love this cologne it  one of my favorite products that Kenneth Cole has that i love the best out there</li>
            <li> Have always wanted this stuff, just never bought it until now. Now it goes in the collection with my Versace Eros, Giorgio Armani Aqua Di Gio, and Cool Water... I think I&#x27;m set for a while. Great smelling cologne and I get a lot of compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Smells sweet and bottle is a medium should last quite a while if used moderately, too bad is not sold in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> Classic cologne that really pulls in compliments. I have worn this to school and work. Women tend to express that this is a safe scent. It&#x27;s not too strong or overbearing but it doesn&#x27;t fade quickly either.</li>
            <li> Smells very nice, this was a new scent for my son and he was happy with it.  Fragrance lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I love it a lot. I have been wanting to wear this product for a long time. Very nice product.</li>
            <li> I got this for my fianc&amp;eacute; for Christmas as it is his favorite cologene and reminds us if our first date. He loves it!</li>
            <li> I was wearing this beautiful fragrance about 10 or 15 years ago and sitting outside of a restaurant.  A woman and her daughter came rushing up to me and asked, &amp;#34;Are You Wearing &#x27;Black?&#x27; &amp;#34;  I said ye,s and the daughter screamed and said, &amp;#34;Oh My God, He&#x27;s Wearing Black!&amp;#34;  I think that says it all...</li>
            <li> Its Kenneth Cole so its a pretty good brand. It smells great when applied, you loose the smell when you ware it but that does not mean that the smell is gone. It just means you are getting used to it.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite men&#x27;s cologne!  My husband  wears cologne every day and usually chooses this one.  Smells great!</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this so I bought this for my boyfriend. He loves it. Very masculine but low-key. Staying power is great too. The price here is the best, too.</li>
            <li> It was the perfect cologne I was looking for and smells great for anything at anytime. It was perfect delivery with excellent spray so buy it !!!!!!</li>
            <li> 1 Star for packing shipping and filled bottle for full of spirits alcohol mixed with Lemon smell...!!&lt;br /&gt;My review: I tried many perfumes many brands of different designers, even from Paris, Italy Milano, Lodi L&#x27;arbollario, Zegna, Boss, Gucci and much more.. First time buy this perfume and read all reviews looks good review. But it&#x27;s really not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does this smell: take spirits alcohol mix fresh green lemon juice, smell that on your own risk. If you don&#x27;t want to do this just go to any Bath and body try Noir perfume and oak perfume that is much better than this perfume. I got deal before buy 3 get 3 free total 6 for $99 I think that will be better if I want to smell Kenneth Cole Black perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No strong it&#x27;s too light smell... Not for who looks for long lasting at least for 1hour! This perfume stay on your clothes or body till 30minutes hardly... Oh yes it&#x27;s burn on skin if you apply directly on under arms or around neck or on shoulders... Don&#x27;t apply it will burn for 10 minutes and smell stays till 30 minutes.. Uggghhh...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottle is very nice and heavy and shiny box that means they invest in bottle and box not for perfume smell.&lt;br /&gt;No where written that this perfume for men!! No smell of musk, woods or floral.. Just lemon smell light that means its not citrus smell citrus smell light orange smell if I&#x27;m not wrong... Different than Macy&#x27;s I smell and used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry don&#x27;t like this product from this vendor, very disappointed, much better eternity for men by CK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways I&#x27;m not going to buy this again...!! You lost one customer...!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-HP</li>
            <li> ive used this cologne for a while and i like having it in my collection. it smells great and is a great value</li>
            <li> I ordered this cologne and it smells great for about 5 min then the smell is gone!!! I went to the store tom compare the pancaking and it is clearly fake I just wish I could get a refund and just go buy the real thing... never again till I buy cologne from online</li>
            <li> A friend of mine requested that I buy him a new scent, so I got Obsession and Black and allowed him to choose which one he liked best when they arrived.  He chose Obsession!  So I ended up with BLACK.  I wore it a couple times and am still figuring out if it&#x27;s &#x27;me&#x27;.  It&#x27;s definitely a bold, date-night kind of scent, which is good for the right occasion, but generally I like to be a little more subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am gonna try this tonight on a gig and see how it does…stand by</li>
            <li> when you put this perfume is very good, but do not feel anything then the perfume. not so much like me.</li>
            <li> Got it on my doorstep today (Feb. 10th, 2014)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I compared the 3.4oz bottle I had purchased from Amazon to a 1.7oz I had purchased at an authorized dealer at the mall. The letterings on the bottle I had purchased from Amazon were different than the ones on the smaller bottle, most notably the letterings for &amp;#34;Kenneth Cole&amp;#34; underneath &amp;#34;BLACK.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is seriously watered down and the scent goes away after a minute or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went to see if I could return it, but could not due to shipping restrictions due to it containing alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still like Amazon, but the dealer that supplies this apparently has a few bottles of the fake stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be saving up for a purchase at an authorized dealer.</li>
            <li> this is my go to scent if I want to impress a woman on a date. this really gives me confidence when I talk with some one in close range.. because I know they are going to get a whiff of this scent.. and would be keen on listening to me. it lasts for the whole day. I put one spray behind the each ear. dont use right before you are going to meet some one.. the scent is strong for the first 10-15 mins. I am not an expert to explain in the aroma classification about how woody it is or not.. but it has a very fresh feel to it. it really wont be so different whether it is summer or winter. I know every one has a summer cologne and a winter cologne.. but this one is a all rounder.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell but not over powering nor long lasting to which I was hoping.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome, girls love it</li>
            <li> Not a rip off. This the real deal.</li>
            <li> As a former cruise ship employee, im use to original colognes, ... this is not the same, it has no lasting smell!!!! So disappointed with Amazon.</li>
            <li> This has an amazing smell and I do really like it. Only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t really last all that long. I mean, you&#x27;ll be able to smell it if your VERY close to the person wearing, and by very, I mean, like, hugging. But it does last a good 3 hours maybe a little longer, so it guess it isn&#x27;t that bad for the price. I&#x27;m 17 and I wear it almost everyday and I do get several complement when I wear it. So if you want attention from ladies than this will do it. I would give it a 5 start rating but it just doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like it too</li>
            <li> Great fragrance.  My gf fell in love with the way it smells on me!</li>
            <li> Not really a Wow factor on this one....you will not offend anyone at work or out and about.. will last a good 5hrs or a least it should unless you have dry skin.. from taking to many long hot showers..very common smell..if your not a risk taker on your scents its a good safe choice..I gave it 3 stars mainly cuz it  was new in the box when delivered .. and I would of payed more in store..its in my collection now so I can say I have some...but will not be in my top 10 juice list..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Kenneth Cole black off and on for years. This is definitely the original sent and a great value!!</li>
            <li> The reason I brought from Amazon was Macy&#x27;s no longer carries these anymore. Plus, price was too good to pass it but maybe I should have? I brought with confidence since Amazon was direct seller. However, the box I received was different than it displayed on the website as smell did not last long. I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the purchased at all since I have brought 2 of them. I would avoid buying any fragrances online.</li>
            <li> In the past, I purchased KC Black from a large retailer and was very satisfied. The smell was nice and it lasted all day. I bought this one and was slightly disappointed. It smells just the same but the smell doesn&#x27;t last long. It fades within an hour. I&#x27;m not sure if this is authentic or if the cologne has gone bad or something, but it isn&#x27;t as good as getting it from a retailer.</li>
            <li> good products I will buy again en the futuro tanks I recive the item en good condiciones I would like recomend this products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying my cologne online for the last couple of times I&#x27;ve run out and it beats the heck out of the retail store prices.  Same stuff, same smell, same everything except for the price.  The only thing that is annoying is that mail law/regulations slow down the shipping  - but they tell you that up front so it&#x27;s not that big of a deal.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Kenneth Cole can do no wrong</li>
            <li> Great masculine smell. Goes best with a black suit or any business attire. My only complaint is that for a cologne of its type, it is a bit mild, but I guess majority would prefer that.</li>
            <li> Best perfume for men out there. Smells great. Doesn&#x27;t choke u or anybody else and lasts really wrong.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It smells very good. I have bought three bottles already. I will cxontinue buying it.Everybody always want to be by my side when i use it.</li>
            <li> This scent should be illegal as it smells so good. My wife loves it! Happy Wife Happy Life! I say buy!</li>
            <li> This is my everyday use cologne. Great price, has a nice masculine smell, always get complimented . Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;I just love my purchase, i always end up as a happy customer, of course i mostly but from sellers fulfilled by Amazon.</li>
            <li> i love the scent of this cologne, very unique and refreshing. I have always used my brother&#x27;s bottle of kenneth cole black (or acqua di gio). it used to be $70 so i never bought it myself. Now that it is only $30, it is totally worth it. women love the scent and when they smell it, they know i am close. I will buy this the rest of my life or until it is discontinued.</li>
            <li> One of the best colognes on the planet. You smell yourself when you put this on and it is not that expensive. Should be in every collection.</li>
            <li> I bought for my friend and he loves it</li>
            <li> Seemed like a fake to me</li>
            <li> My signature cologne. Only cologne I keep buying when I run out. Its simply amazing</li>
            <li> I buy this perfume for my husband, and he loves it, It is really good, have good price and he wear it all full day. thanks</li>
            <li> The perfume doesn&#x27;t last longer and fizzles out. Seems it was diluted. Bad deal. Whereas I know KC Black is more lingering and stays for a longer time. This one stayed for a max 4 hours.</li>
            <li> I love it and have received many compliments from women since I started using this cologne.  It is now my go-to scent for everyday usage.</li>
            <li> My favorite night on the town Cologne</li>
            <li> Long lasting fragrance. Just a couple sprays is all you need....Commanding fragrance....</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t stay long... will not buy again</li>
            <li> I do not know how trhia smells because I bought it as a gift for a male friends birthday.  but it did arrive before schedule so I was able to give it on this persons birthday.  thank you.</li>
            <li> it is not long lasting at all it disappear as soon as you apply on. I think its not original</li>
            <li> Great value for its price. I have used this cologne for a long time and I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I love love love this cologne.  It lasts about 6 hours in total with it being almost an even split of blasting fragrance and three hours of dry down aroma.  I have been smiled at repeated and complimented several times since I began using this and although I know it still is adjusting to my chemistry I can only see this bond growing fonder.  I recommend it to anyone.  Its a 30ish dollar bottle of 80ish dollar smelling and quality fragrance, cant beat that.</li>
            <li> must have for any collection. sophisticated smell for a unsophisticated person.  goes well with any occasion. doesn&#x27;t require a lot</li>
            <li> affortable toilette spray great offer by amazon 35 dollarswith free shipment 4-5 days if offer. saving $$$ buck in store there by it self 70 dollares i try diffrent toilette this best fragment will last long.. even people ask me at work defendly recomed for a date or personal use great product look forward purchase more u wont be desapointed...</li>
            <li> fiance&#x27; likes it, &amp; i like it. pretty much all that matters. buy it, it is an awesome smelling cologne.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this in the past as gifts for different family members. This was his first time smelling it and he loved it. He now has a new favorite cologne and it is very inexpensive for such a high quality.</li>
            <li> It Seems like good quality and my son loved it because it was masculine.  Speedy shipping. Made it for Christmas</li>
            <li> Not sure how to write a review about a cologne. It smells good. :)  It has a citrus smell I guess, and I think it is very appealing to women. With a lot of colognes now, to me, they don&#x27;t seem to last as long as some of the ones I used when I was younger. In fact, after I few minutes, you won&#x27;t even know you have this on. That doesn&#x27;t mean other people won&#x27;t be able to smell it though. However, I would say you probably need to apply these types of sprays a couple of times a day. I keep mine in the car with me and spray as needed.</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend and he just loves it.  Smells GREAT, and just a little goes a long way.  Would recommend it.  If you are a girl, make your man even more attractive by spraying him with this</li>
            <li> One of my favorite colognes. I get more attention from the smell of this stuff then most other colognes. Last a good long time too.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrant scent! The price was ridiculously cheap, as well. Very satisfied with this cologne.</li>
            <li> not a bad fragrance just doesn&#x27;t last  but about2 hours... was left in the direct sun here in AZ.... 110 degrees!</li>
            <li> I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS KENNETH!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Spray it on, enjoy the sent until it dries, then it&#x27;s gone. Recommend &amp;#34;SEDUCTION IN BLACK For Men By ANTONIO BANDERAS Eau De Toilette Spray&amp;#34;  instead...</li>
            <li> Its exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> The perfume is good but not what i expected, the reach of the fragrance isn&#x27;t too much.</li>
            <li> This is a great smell for men. It isn&#x27;t so strong. Some sprays smell too strong and they ar offensive. This is just right</li>
            <li> I own several colognes that I alternate though the week and, not only is this my favorite, it also last all day.  Always receive compliments!</li>
            <li> The picture of this cologne shows a box and a lid. I ordered this as a Christmas present and it came with no lid and no box. I felt like I was giving a stolen item as a gift. The price was right, but I would only buy this if you are keeping it for yourself and not giving it to someone else.</li>
            <li> Really nice cologne at a great price.  I&#x27;d buy this one again!  I get great compliments when I wear it. Can&#x27;t wait for Amazon to expand their cologne selection.</li>
            <li> Product arrived earlier then planned. Forgot how much I loved this cologne. Thanks for the great deal.</li>
            <li> Super long lasting scent great for work, dress  and leisure.</li>
            <li> i am big on colognes for my husband as well as he is, i think he told me he likes it just because he didn&#x27;t want me to feel bad after buying it, however i can tell he does not fancies it due to him wearing it less loll. It has this cinnamon scent</li>
            <li> Product came exactly as described.  Exceptionally great value for the price.  This is my favorite cologne and I will only buy this one.</li>
            <li> The ladies love my aroma</li>
            <li> Smells very fresh and clean. Doesnt last all day</li>
            <li> Most other sellers price items high for less quantity.  I got quantity at a price point very reasonable.  Good times.</li>
            <li> Kenneth Cole&#x27;s Black is a wonderful smell that any woman would be happy to have on her husband or boyfriend. I love this very masculine aroma and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> i will be doing all my perfume shopping here in the future.. they were quick and reasonably priced.. as my daughter says, she loves her smells goods....</li>
            <li> I brought this for my husband after smelling it on a gentleman ohh it puts me in the mood great. Very musky and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times, around work, around friends, and even on a few dates. So far it gets the attention that many of the reviews have stated. The scent is awesome, and as a young adult it makes me feel like I have that &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; scent that I know a lot of people expect/like on a guy. Would buy again and would recommend to friends!</li>
            <li> Smells great! Last long</li>
            <li> If you often dress-up for going out or work (I often need to dress nice for my work/entertainment) this gives you that trendy but cool smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont think you can wear this fragrance for the walk at the beach or casual sundays, though (without being weird)</li>
            <li> I am particular about the colognes I wear. Black smells nice but wears off somewhat quickly and can leave an alcohol after-smell. However, overall I like it and will continue to wear it until I run out. I won&#x27;t buy a second bottle though.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne on 11/1/2008 and though it does smell like Kenneth Cole Black and is more than likely genuine, the serial number was carved out of the bottom of the bottle. Other than that, the product is okay.</li>
            <li> I got this cologne as a gift for my husband. It has always been my all time favorite men&#x27;s cologne and you can buy it on Amazon for slightly cheaper than you can in stores.</li>
            <li> This is the fifth bottle I&#x27;ve bought, simply great. Strongly recommended. If you like this, might also try Reaction, same designer.</li>
            <li> I think it smells good. second time I got this because the first time I was so happy with the product.</li>
            <li> He really love it. It smell so good on him. And he really love it. What else can i say, that he love it.</li>
            <li> Manly smell! Arrived within 3 days of placing order. Recommended. Have not used this one in the past. Hope the perfume lasts for a while.</li>
            <li> I liked Kenneth Cole Black so much I ordered two.&lt;br /&gt;Great scent.  The wife, daughter, granddaughter like it as well.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say much. It came as promised, unsealed. I won&#x27;t be using it, therefore I have no complaints either.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what I expected and the price was the best we had found after searching. I would definitely reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> Serious doubts about the authenticity of this product. I&#x27;ve used this cologne consistently for the last 8-9 years - This smells different, the top and the packaging seems off too as compared to my last bottle ( I purchased my previous bottle from Amazon too and am comparing these side by side).</li>
            <li> Loved it, Amazing fragance, For people with a strong personality and masculinity... 100% original.... It was well packaged and delivered real soon...</li>
            <li> Kenneth Cole Black is an excellent men&#x27;s cologne. The sale price for the larger size bottle made the Kenneth Cole Black quite a bargain and a tough deal to beat in men&#x27;s colognes.</li>
            <li> i have bought this perfume a couples of weeks ago and I&#x27;m very disappointed how smell this product( i don&#x27;t want to call it perfume)...smell like fake one and regretting buying it. i don&#x27;t return it because i live oversea and i guess i will spend more money.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, long lasting and gets even better by time.&lt;br /&gt;My wife keeps roaming around me when I am wearing this.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE THE PRODUCT AND IS THE SAME QUALITY AS ANY OTHER STORE COULD GIVE YOU ,IAM  SO  HAPPY  WITH  IT  IF  I COULD  I  BUY  ANOTHER  ONE</li>
            <li> The smell of this perfume is above average but it does not contain any natural oils - only alcohols. For this reason the smell does not last long. I am a lover of Calvin Klein Eternity for Men and would rate KC Black secondary to Eternity. Good fragrance for a change.</li>
            <li> I ordered this cologne along with Kenneth Cole Reaction. I received this order first and when I got it I thought it would be my favorite cologne going forward....I was wrong lol. Reaction edges this one out, but slightly. It&#x27;s not overpowering and does a great job of lingering for the entire day. A great purchase and I would recommend trying it out if you&#x27;re on the fence...you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> THE PRICE IS UNBEATABLE, AND THE SMELL IF WONDERFUL. I WOULD DEFINITELY BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN. YOU CAN BUY 2 FOR THE PRICE OF 1 IN A DEPT STORE.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for myself. I have always used this perfume and I thought this would be a nice gift at a little better price when compared to other retailers. This is my first time placing an order for perfumes from Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The perfume fragrance is nice, which it has always been. But for some reason, the smell wouldn&#x27;t last even couple hours which I suspect if Amazon receives a different product shipment from Manufacturers which is not the same as what Macys or any other retailers would receive for Fragrances. Since I have bought the same product from a different retailer in the past and the fragrance would last much longer, there is no other reason for me to doubt that Amazon&#x27;s sells the same product but is not exactly comparable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would never buy and would not recommend perfumes from Amazon in future. This is a great place to buy other stuff but not fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spend a little extra money to get the full worth of your hard earned $$.</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance and comfortable in public  and sure to buy more when its over</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Kenneth Cole Black, how can it be wrong!!! It has been the same since its creation. Just for the love of God don&#x27;t \\&quot;improve\\&quot; it!!</li>
            <li> very excellent, I love to much , I will buy it again, and it&#x27;s my best choise , thanks&lt;br /&gt;+++++++++++++++++++A</li>
            <li> Really great smelling cologne.</li>
            <li> Wow!  Women love this smell. I get compliments every day at work. Some of my co-workers say they love being near me just to smell me.</li>
            <li> All product are fantastic</li>
            <li> This cologne has been my favorite for quite some time now, and I always gotta have it when the can empties. I usually bought it from Macy&#x27;s, but now that I found it on here, this has become my new favorite spot. The price is super great, the packaging is excellent, the product is 100% original, the delivery timeframe meets my expectations and standards, it is a great buy overall! Now, the product itself is just amazing, the scent is fresh, young but not too young, I&#x27;m 30 years old and I think it meets that age range between 21-35, I get great compliments when I wear it, definitely recommend it to any guy out there. Great product, plus you cannot go wrong with Kenneth Cole!</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Kenneth Cole Black. It&#x27;s my favorite sent for men. I order this for my boyfriend for Valentine&#x27;s day and it shipped very fast, was packaged well, and smells amazing - as it always does! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I took it after reading several comments.&lt;br /&gt;The product is good, its strong but for some reason I don;t see it lasting long.</li>
            <li> I tried this cologne on at the local big box store. For$30 less, I was able to get this fantastic cologne. It does come off a little &amp;#34;alcohol&amp;#34;ish smelling at first but firms up after exposure to the air. Great buy.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite cologne.  It smells great without being too over powering and I&#x27;ve gotten quite a few complements on the nights that I&#x27;ve worn it.</li>
            <li> Smells great wish my husband would wear it more..lol</li>
            <li> PURCHASED IT FOR MY BOY FRIEND AND IT SMELLS AWESOME, HE LOVES IT! I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR SURE!</li>
            <li> This is something that I had been looking for and when I saw it being offered at a very good price I bought it.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what my son wanted and for a fair price. You can pay 2 or 3 times the online price if you chose to buy it at a department store. It was delivered right to my doorstep.</li>
            <li> It fades away quicker. It smells good, but it does not last long. But for he price it is ok.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells on my boyfriend. Bottle is nice too. Comes with the cap to keep the spray part protected.</li>
            <li> I love Kenneth Cole Black and this does not disappoint. It is real and not a knock off. great price</li>
            <li> This was a very good buy for the price.  I am very happy with this product.  I would like more!</li>
            <li> It is a very good buy for the price. The scent is amazing and different from other brands. An instant favorite</li>
            <li> Great item with good scent. It is just as Kenneth Cole perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great item. I look forward to more of this</li>
            <li> Since I didn&#x27;t want to waste away money on a cologne that could be a bust (like the Nautica ones), I decided to go off with the mini version of this through Fragrance.net.  Boy, what can I say?  This cologne is very distinct, but great!  When my mini one runs out, I will buy the larger one that&#x27;s for sure.  This is something that&#x27;s totally different from anything I have ever smelled before.  I can&#x27;t really describe it, but for me, it gives off this mysterious smell - like if I were to pass someone who was wearing this cologne, I would immediately turn my head around and wonder where in the world he got that cologe.  Basically, it&#x27;s an attention getter.  Not trying to sound silly, but in brief words, this a must buy.  I would have to say that this cologne, Bleu de Chanel, Hugo by Hugo Boss are my favorite colognes.&lt;br /&gt;-jaemanlosangeles.yelp.com</li>
            <li> My boyfriend LOVES (times infinity) this cologne and so do I. I highly recommend. It makes the perfect gift for him.</li>
            <li> I have used the product for a number of years. What I purchased through Amozon was not of the same quality I have grown accoustom to. I feel short changed and will not make any future purchase though amozon.&lt;br /&gt;This is my first only time I will use this service. I decided to use amazon to save a trip to the department store.</li>
            <li> Like the name and bottle dont really care for smell.  xxxx xxxxx xxxx xxxx xxxxx xxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx</li>
            <li> I loved it since i opened the package, it&#x27;s a strong fragrance with citrics and wooden scents, that gives you that wellness feeling during the day.</li>
            <li> Bought from amazon directly. Good scent. Not very powerful and doesn&#x27;t have staying power at all. I know I will be fortifying my Tommy Bahama scents before I think about buying any Kenneth Cole products again.</li>
            <li> The product was just as described and was exactly what the photo showed! The shipping time was great and this made a perfect gift for my brother!</li>
            <li> Love it! Done with the first bottle, ready to order the next!</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this cologne and even more the price tag on it. Dont have to break the bank everytime to smell good.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and have gotten some good compliments.</li>
            <li> Very fresh smell, for any ocassion and very classy of course ! I have been using it for 8 years ! Will keep buying until I die.</li>
            <li> I went to buy this at our local mall for a Christmas present for my son in law after I purchased this bottle online for my son.  I paid $55 for the same, exact product.  The packaging was identical and both were the authentic product.  The online description said to expect some shipping delay, but I got the package within days.  Very pleased I made this purchase.  I have to tell you that I was cautioned against buying cologne/perfumes online as often you don&#x27;t receive the authentic product.  I can tell you with 100% certainty I received the genuine product packaged exactly as I bought it at the upscale department store from which I purchased the 2nd bottle for over $20 more.</li>
            <li> I love this purchase!  The scene is a beautiful, aromatic array of scents that come together to make this cologne.  You should definitely buy it for yourself, or your man!</li>
            <li> I was kind of weary about buying my brother this for Chirstmas, but he loves it and I love it. It smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, lasts well I use it for everyday use. No one has complained about it being over powering. A few compliments. Fair price for a good product.</li>
            <li> Maybe I received a dud, but this scent disappears on me within a half hour. I bought it directly from Amazon so tampering is unlikely. Most reviews seems overwhelmingly positive though, so my purchase may have just been a lemon.</li>
            <li> This is a manly scent good for everyday use!  Its perfect because its not too strong nor herb-like. However, if your looking to wear it on a night out, its not strong enough to beat other odors such as smoke, etc. For a night out, try Gucci intense or gucci guilty intense. Worked for us. Other than that great price and sealed packaging. Brand new in box.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! Always get good things told about the way it smells and the scent seems to stick around all day, which is great!</li>
            <li> Great scent, my husband loves it..and so do I. I will definitely be buying this one again. Try Kenneth Cole Black if you like CK colognes. Anyway it would make a great holiday gift!!</li>
            <li> Ordered as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend cause I did NOT have time to go out and go shopping - I worked retail at the time so holiday season I had zero life or time - came so quick and just as stated - PLUS it smells delicious</li>
            <li> Kenneth Cole makes great fragrances and this is a great cologne.  Its not overpowering and has a medium scent life.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite cologne for my husband. Not only does it smell great but it lasts so much longer than other colognes that I get him.</li>
            <li> This one of the best smelling colognes I have ever purchased.  I like it so much I use it sometimes even if I am not going anywhere.  It is not an overpowering smell or too exotic, it is just pleasant.  I am no expert so it is hard to describe.  Add to that is it really affordable and it is a real winner in my book!</li>
            <li> What can you say about some Kenneth Cole cologne that I purchased for my college aged brother?  He loves it, his girlfriend loves it -- for the price, and the ULTRA FAST shipping 4 days before Christmas, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> I do not like the smell. I expected more slightly disappointed</li>
            <li> One of my favorite fragrances of all time!</li>
            <li> Great price Fianc&amp;eacute; loves it.</li>
            <li> I bought two for my brothers and they love the scent :)</li>
            <li> This is my new go-to perfume!</li>
            <li> Great light smell....not bold...but not disappointing!</li>
            <li> Ordered Kenneth Cole Black without ever trying it previously.&lt;br /&gt;I had heard the name, that&#x27;s all.&lt;br /&gt;I loved it! It&#x27;s one of my favorites. Not too heavy with a touch of citrus.&lt;br /&gt;Very nice.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff, the scent sticks around longer than all my other colognes (around 4-5hrs) but if you spray it on your skin instead of your clothes then it will stay on there the whole day.</li>
            <li> I just went into the store intending to buy it based on another review I read. I gave it a sample sniff. It really reminded me of Stetson Preferred Stock that I wore when I was 12 years old. Nothing special or exciting about it.</li>
            <li> Smells good but very weak projection and longevity.</li>
            <li> Smells great and lasts a long time. I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I just ordered this cologne based on the reviews but the perfume I got was no way near the reviews mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;The perfume smell doesn&#x27;t even last for 5 mins.I guess the one that I got was a fake one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this scent. It goes really well with leather bags and black/dark clothing. Why do i say that? because I choose my cologne depending on what I&#x27;m wearing for the day and the weather. If I&#x27;m wearing dark clothing then this is a cologne I would use along with the likes of Armani Code, YSL and CKbe. Hopefully that gives you an idea of what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Black always stands out with the ladies and I&#x27;m always catching people getting a bit too close for comfort to just get another quick sniff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS HOW A MODERN DAY MAN SHOULD SMELL.</li>
            <li> Happy with purchase. Glad to find it here at a great price.  Love the smell.</li>
            <li> husband jus loves dis fragrance</li>
            <li> I love the smell. I feel confident and I also get compliments when I&#x27;m wearing it. I would buy this again!</li>
            <li> LOVE this cologne, I purchased it for my boyfriend and he loves it as well.</li>
            <li> this is just what I asked for, the product is excellent, original, had everything as advertised, I loved it and great price</li>
            <li> I found this product to be amazing for the price. I constantly wear this cologne. It has a very manly smell.</li>
            <li> IT SMELLS AWESOME AND WILL DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN. PRICE WAS GREAT AND SHIPPING WAS FAST. THIS IS A SEXY SCENT, YOU WON&#x27;T BE DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of my best for daily use is excellent for cool nights which is such describre. no use sending complaints is within the set limits.</li>
            <li> The scent is just awesome!&lt;br /&gt;I would stick to this one even after I finish this.&lt;br /&gt;It goes well with any type of dress codes.</li>
            <li> My dad loves this cologne and it was so easy to buy online and ship to him for Christmas. Perfect gift.</li>
            <li> This was Great product overall. It is a very good smell and received lots of compliments. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a girl and I wear this cologne often, just because I love smelling it. Guys, please wear this so women will swoon, it really is intoxicating!</li>
            <li> THE WORST PERFUME I EVER BOUGHT! JUST LIKE INSECTICIDE!</li>
            <li> I agree with the other positive comments. This spray is amazing. My husband loves it. Made a good buy. I will buy it again</li>
            <li> I had no idea what to pick out for my husband.  All I knew is that it couldn&#x27;t be too strong, because I get migraines really easily with strong scents.  So, I started reading reviews on different colognes.  This one didn&#x27;t sound too strong.  Also, of course, I tried to choose one that I thought my husband would like.  He wears Stetson and frankly, I am sick to death of Stetson.  I never have told my husband that, but it is way too strong in my opinion.  I was pleasantly surprised when his Kenneth Cole Black came today.  It has a nice scent and is not too strong.  Of course, if you spray it on heavily, it will be strong.  Best yet, my husband really likes it, too!  So, I did \\&quot;good\\&quot;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  8-8-13  After smelling this cologne a few times now, I am afraid it is too strong for me.  To me, it is just as intense as Stetson.  I&#x27;m looking for a smooth men&#x27;s cologne. Not overpowering.  That is migraine headache city.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again. :(  Still on the search...........</li>
            <li> this is  very great smelling, ive used it twice but id like to use more often then I do but love the scent</li>
            <li> I have been on the search for a new sent for a while now. I was at the very last drops of Givenchy Play Intense so figured I should try this. I am very happy I did. It is just strong enough to notice bit far from overpowering. I am not a reviewer of colognes so I can&#x27;t tell you about the different types of fragrances, I can only say that the ladies seem to like it.</li>
            <li> This scent is so good I don&#x27;t want it to finish.  And the girls love it on me too.  Get lots of compliments.  This is a must buy for all the gents out there.  Don&#x27;t leave home without it.</li>
            <li> I give it 5 out of 5 stars.  My girlfriend would give it 7 out of 5 stars if she could.</li>
            <li> I really like the way it smelled. I can&#x27;t keep the girls off of me now, it kind of became a nuisances to be honest.  Every time I take at least 3 girls home. Every desperate guy should buy this. It will change your life!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my boyfriend.  He loves this and smells so good. Great buy.</li>
            <li> This cologne was given as a gift, and the recipient was very happy.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is mild and fresh scented.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> My husband loves the smell, and price was fair too.</li>
            <li> Very good smell. My husband loved it. I got the original product too.</li>
            <li> this i my #2 behind polo black. great for work as it&#x27;s unique but not overpowering</li>
            <li> product was really dissapointing, smell lasts only for one hour. was waiting much more. i recommend not to buy!!</li>
            <li> Bought it for hubby and he really liked it. He did say it isn&#x27;t one of his favorites but he would wear it again if someone bought it for him. The smell didn&#x27;t last as long as his other colognes.</li>
            <li> This is so good my wife won&#x27;t let me wear it unless we&#x27;re together!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  Smells great</li>
            <li> This is one to aquire.This is a different kind of oder.  Its nice but it is different.  It would not hurt to try it.</li>
            <li> Very nice, one spray an your good to go throughout the day</li>
            <li> Black by Kenneth Cole is one of my husband&#x27;s favorites.  The purchase was a just because surprise because he couldn&#x27;t find it in the store. Now he&#x27;s happy.</li>
            <li> This is one of my all time favorite fragrances. It gives you a very modern, crisp, and refreshing scent that lasts a good while. I got a sample from a friend of mine, and went out and bought it the very next day. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful smell, rich and bold, and lasts a considerably long time compared to other colognes.  I have been complimented many times on the fragrance and would definitely purchase it again.  The item is reasonably priced and ships very quickly.  If your thinking of purchasing this cologne you won&#x27;t be dissappointed in it.</li>
            <li> As advertised, lasts around 3to4 hours on my body then turns into a more \\&quot;fruity\\&quot; smell which actually smells better than the original.  Packaging was original and had no problems as some other reviews have stated.</li>
            <li> The Kenneth Cole Black by Kenneth Cole for Men is an extremely wonderful product that the scent is welcoming and not overpowerful.  Women loves it too.</li>
            <li> Packaged very well to protect the glass bottle. Just wore it the other day and smells AMAZING! I would say it lasted pretty long and goes from a strong scent to a subtle eye opening scent over time. I definitely will wear when I go out to bars/clubbing/special event nights.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell but it doesn&#x27;t stick around or change throughout the day. Compared to what I am wearing now (Ralph Lauren Polo Green) and past colognes I must say this is at the lower end of my scale. May just be me though, as I initially ordered this due to the positive reviews on Amazon, usually when a product is rated so high it&#x27;s darn good.</li>
            <li> Smell don&#x27;t last long it got to be watered down its a good cologne to by if your going to get the real thing</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend as a birthday gift. He used to wear it when we first met. Arrived on time and securely packaged. The scent is very clean, crisp and manly. Love it.</li>
            <li> this was a i lov you gift for my husband and we both loved it .The smell will drive the ladys wild.</li>
            <li> Best present I ever bought for my husband !!!!!!!!  It was a gift for me too !  Love the scent and the man.</li>
            <li> Product arrive on time. This cologne have a smoothly scent that ladies like. Got many complements from the ladies from work and outside. Overall, great product to use.</li>
            <li> I have always enjoyed this fragrance. I was very happy to see the price at amazon. It usually runs me 20-25 $ more at local departmental stores. I was very confused about ordering because whenever i read reviews of fragrances there always are some ppl claiming that they got fake ones. I got mine from amazon, not from a merchant and it is genuine. I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this product as a gift for a friend. The presentation of the product was very appealing to me and the recipient of the gift enjoyed the scent.</li>
            <li> Received this cologne years ago as a gift and liked it.  It&#x27;s not an extremely fancy cologne but is perfect for everyday use as it is not overpowering.  Use it sometimes when going to work or just to hang out with some friends.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband for Christmas.  The price was a lot less expensive than in the department stores however, I don&#x27;t think the scent is as strong and it does not linger......a little disapointed.</li>
            <li> I love my Kenneth Cole Black ,order the same one over 4 years now ...&lt;br /&gt;worth every $ that i spend</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for my boyfriend for Valentine&#x27;s Day because he loves the way it smells. It was perfect for the price and he loved it. For the first week it was ok but I noticed the scent faded faster than when he had this cologne before. About a week ago the top cracked into two pieces (it was not dropped) out of nowhere and you could tell that the two pieces had been glued together which the authentic bottle does not have. Now I feel like the cologne is fading faster when he puts it on and barely smells to begin with. I am highly dissatisfied with this product and will never buy cologne from amazon again.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Smells like a million bucks.</li>
            <li> Took long to receive and was not what I expected it was false advertising and did not meet my standards,  I won&#x27;t send it back</li>
            <li> i love kenneth cole black, since the price on amazon was super low, i ordered from amazon for the first time, athough it smells like the authentic black perfume, the bottle is different, absolutely no print on the bottle! i am a little worried if this is authentic, it&#x27;s sold by amazon so it has to be authentic right? i guess i got what i paid for?!</li>
            <li> Nice scent! Just the right smell.</li>
            <li> This was for my dad,and he loved it</li>
            <li> Smells great.  se it for every day use but also for going out with wifey to dinner.  Great price too.</li>
            <li> I received this cologne as a present about 2 years ago and really enjoy the scent.  It is the perfect balance; a woodsy, sporty, chic scent.  This cologne can be used right before going to the gym as well as for going on a dinner date.  Best all-around scent.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as an anniversary gift for my husband. He used to wear it some years ago but I remembered how great it smelled so I bought him some more. Its such a sexy and masculine scent. I Love It</li>
            <li> for the money i paid i feel this is the best you could do for cologne. It&#x27;s just a solid purchase</li>
            <li> My fiance uses this all the time. It smells fantastic. I usually buy him a new bottle for Valentine&#x27;s day.</li>
            <li> I like the scent of this. Not too tangy and not too strong either.</li>
            <li> My third time purchasing this product  great value, great price and great fragrance . Could not be more pleased, love it on.</li>
            <li> Smells good and arrived fast</li>
            <li> When you smell it for the first time it smells good but it does not last long, the max I have seen is 3 hours.</li>
            <li> Product is great as usual... but it takes forever to arrive!!!</li>
            <li> This smells very good and i feel so fresh even after so many hours. Leaves no stains on the clothes. U can happily buy it.</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve given 4.5 stars if allowed.  I ordered Nautica at same time, since that was the #1 seller.  I &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; this 6 days out of 7 and go to fallback to mix it up (Paul Sabastian).</li>
            <li> Cologne name - \\&quot;Black\\&quot; - is cooler than the scent of this concoction. Nice, but nothing special. Reminds me of a dewy morning walk in the woods, with all types of soggy  smells rising from the brambles beneath my sneakers.</li>
            <li> this is the best price I&#x27;ve ever seen for this cologne and I really like the way it smells so I got it for my son on Christmas, he also likes it</li>
            <li> lllllllllllllooove this cologne, what more can I say! It arrived just b4 Christmas as I expected it to my brother wasoo happy with this gift to!</li>
            <li> Nice smell but the scent goes away after 20 minutes. Look at Hugo Boss or Roberto Roberto Cavalli Black if you want something similar.</li>
            <li> Great product! Smells great. My girlfriend preferred it over my $100 Versace cologne. Definitely worth the money! Four stars because it could last a little longer, but it&#x27;s great for a casual date or something. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Not good I think is a fake one, doesn&#x27;t have any smell only alcohol</li>
            <li> I am going to be one sad man when I can&#x27;t find this anymore.  I&#x27;ve been using this scent for almost eight years now and simply can&#x27;t imagine having to switch to anything else.  Light citrus scent with a touch of something else I can&#x27;t put my finger on, but both my wife and I agree that this is the one for me.</li>
            <li> This is like an emergency fragrance that could be use when you have nothing else around you</li>
            <li> My poor hubby...a while back I got him Black as a gift and when he finally ran out, I snapped this up online, thrilled at the low, low price.  I didn&#x27;t pay close enough attention to realize that it was a much lighter eau de toilette.  He says that the scent is not as nice (kinda cheap), and he has to spray on a lot more.  It was my bad...bummer.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my husband. It smells sexy and extravagant. This cologne was a very good purchase. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Seriously though, great scent and a reasonable price. Go to Macy&#x27;s and you&#x27;ll spend too much. I also tried the deorderant. Smells good but not great protection.</li>
            <li> excellent  tks I can&#x27;t complain it is fabulous really a very good buy would buy again. Was affordable and reached on time.</li>
            <li> I received this bottle and the atomizer was not properly secured to the bottle resulting with my living room carpet smelling like Kenneth Cole Black indefinitely. I was disappointed to find out that cologne was an item that amazon does not accept as a return. Upon contacting amazon I was happy to find out that they will do a refund on defective cologne. Thanks amazon for not being unreasonable.</li>
            <li> this article is excellent, very good quality, excellent finish, for my part recommend, and I assure you 100% that enjoy acquiring an article like this ....!!</li>
            <li> Came really fast smells amazing</li>
            <li> The actual product is nice. Not sure if it is real or not though, the font of the Kenneth Cole looks a bit different but either way, it smells really good. After purchasing, I did find another website with a cheaper price for it but after you pay for shipping it is more expensive than this one. (Yay for free shipping!)</li>
            <li> Fake don&#x27;t waist your money over this.</li>
            <li> Its a wonderful daily spray to use. Refreshes you and is long lasting. Should have atleast one in your collection.</li>
            <li> This is a great price have gotten it twice a year for my sons birthday and Christmas for the last 4 years.</li>
            <li> nice gift to give with kindle. everyone should get this as soon as possible. it is worth the money. great gift.</li>
            <li> My man smells wonderful when he wears &#x27;Black&#x27; by Kenneth Cole. Will never order anything else for him to wear.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected it to be. It was a gift, and my father loved it. Way cheapr then deartment stores.</li>
            <li> these smells that come from the juice smell so good.  I feel like a mature man about to take a woman out</li>
            <li> This cologne is absolutely one of the best colognes I have ever bought someone as a gift. My boyfriend loves it and I love smelling it on him!</li>
            <li> This cologne smells amazing. I bought this with out smelling it first and I was surprised how great it smells. It is a great size too!</li>
            <li> I brought Kenneth Cole Black as a Christmas gift for a family member who really likes the fragrance and wears it regularly!  He was pleasantly surprised and pleased to receive it as a Christmas gift!  I definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys a men&#x27;s cologne!good</li>
            <li> very strong and manly..he did get  a lot of compliments. people would ask him what he was wearing. if you want to gift someone a good cologne...this could be a good choice.</li>
            <li> Great price for this product.  Great smelling</li>
            <li> After using this a few years back, it came to be my new favorite. Very manly, spicy and dark. While I won&#x27;t try to break it down in any official capacity, it reminds me of the scent of leather, with a touch of spice. Maybe a bit much for work, though a light application would probably be okay. Great for evenings out. Much better than the light \\&quot;sport and/or aqua\\&quot; scents that abound as of late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea how it is offered so cheap on here. I was worried that I was going to get a fake, but all packaging was intact and legit. Having owned this before, I can testify without any doubt that this is the real thing. Sure beats the $80 price tag I found on it in the department store last week.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne.  I saw it in the Kenneth Cole outlet store for $70.  So glad to have found it this inexpensive.  Everyone comments on it.  The product was exactly as advertised and delivery was speedy.</li>
            <li> Actually this perfume is really nice and its smell is very attractive. I like it because its smell lasts long time and all my friends like it too. I recommend it, I am sure that yoy will like it.</li>
            <li> One thing I learnt about amazon is that you always have to trust the negative reviews. Most of the positive ones are fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the item in good condition. I already have a KC black and this one is no where near the original one. Smell fades within minutes. Generally my KC lasts whole day. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone to buy perfumes, colognes and valuable stuff on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone and everyone it smells so wonderful!! Its great for a gift anyone will be happy with it.</li>
            <li> Not my taste. Jacomo de jacomo much better. Depend upon individuals. Once again not my tase? However Good Presentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good for Gift may be?</li>
            <li> The girlfriend likes this, which is really the only thing that matters in my cologne choice so long as it doesn&#x27;t irritate me.  Also much cheaper on amazon than in a department store.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the size of the bottle and the amount of cologne in it. Overall, I am pleased with the product and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good cologne for less than 30 dollars.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product for myself. Family member agreed that it smelled fantastic, so I purchased more as gifts.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite cologne for a long time. I&#x27;m not really sure if Kenneth Cole even makes it anymore but it still smells the same and is a great product. My girl loves the smell as have most of my female friends. Product came as described and expected.</li>
            <li> As long as he likes it, it is fine by me. It does smell very good and I like the name</li>
            <li> It came earlier than expected, new (no tester sticker like some have said), and smells great. Had no problems whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of compliments when I wear it!  It has a similar quality smell to Kenneth Cole New York, which was discontinued and also Kenneth Cole RSVP.</li>
            <li> I like it. It smells good. Not too strong. So pretty good for a first date. Go for something else your plan is to knock her out with your smell.&lt;br /&gt;Black is my go to stuff when I am just going out with friends as it is not overpoering at all. I can;t stand it when I can smell a guy from across the bar and not the woman I am sitting next to.&lt;br /&gt;Black. My go to smelly stuff.</li>
            <li> I already got it for my husband I like this smell.&lt;br /&gt;But this time is for a gift for my family.</li>
            <li> The perfume is very musky as well as spicy. Not so long-lasting though. Still, a great buy for under $40</li>
            <li> To coin the expression once you go black...lol...this is a very captivating fragrance that is very distinctive. This will definitely remain one of my favs</li>
            <li> Makes my husband smell edible yum</li>
            <li> What can i say,i love this fragrance&lt;br /&gt;persist for a long time on me&lt;br /&gt;i love Kenneth Cole&lt;br /&gt;Botlle and box was perfectly</li>
            <li> One of the best Men&#x27;s colognes out there. Ladies you need to get your husbands or boyfriends some!!! It is my Fav!</li>
            <li> Cheapest place to buy this cologne great deal and now I smell delicious</li>
            <li> huge fan of these scent - awesome - sexy!</li>
            <li> For me this fragrance is too sweet. I still have had many compliments on it though regardless of my personal feelings. For the price i cannot complain. It&#x27;s not a purchase I would make again, based on my own taste but i would recommend it to anyone that likes Nautica and Michael Jordan fragrances.</li>
            <li> Always a hit with huzboo....This is my 4th purchase of the same product</li>
            <li> The scent does not last long. But based off other reviews Kenneth Cole Black is supposed to be one of the longest lasting and best cologne on the market. And leads me to think some sellers water down the product so be careful when ordering online.</li>
            <li> i never smelled or heard of this mens spray before. Based on reviews and popularity on amazon i took a gamble and it was won 4/5 stars for me. Bargain for price and swag. good collection to add to my colognes.</li>
            <li> Best smelling colone ever</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t smell how it did in the store, this is maybe a fake. But they ignored me when I asked</li>
            <li> Good smell women love it</li>
            <li> This spray smells fantastic. Not too strong, and lasts for a fairly long time. Exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> When I open the lid, the nozzle was stuck in it and came out, the tube broke and now it is hardly functional. On the other hand, items having flammable liquids cannot be returned to Amazon. However, it had a very nice smell after all!</li>
            <li> I chose this product for my guy bc he is a big KC fan I have never seen him w a KC cologne and this was a big surprise whn I gave it to him .. I have gained another badge adding to the recently bought KC wallet.</li>
            <li> The last cologne I really liked was Polo Blue. It was really fabulous smelling, worked well for my body and I could continue to smell it faintly all day long. It was refreshing for me and complimented by others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that I&#x27;ve flirted with a couple of colognes from CK and a French one, however nothing has been of the same caliber as Black. I&#x27;ve had this for a couple of weeks now and I think it works great for me. It is not super strong but it lasts 20+ hours and you just can&#x27;t beat the price at Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!</li>
            <li> Great scent addition! Its probably a bit to strong to wear to work, but great to wear on casual nights out.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells great, and is a great value if you get it for the right price.  The scent lasts all day and by night time it still lingers and smells good.</li>
            <li> The smells seems a little strong for work and more like for a club, but I don,t go to any clubs so I wear it to my office where my secretaries tells me the cologne smells good.</li>
            <li> Great!! Everything I expected!</li>
            <li> Got such a good deal on this and it saved us a trip to our local department store.  Sooo easy.</li>
            <li> I am not a super fan of this fragrance but it was given to me once and it worked its way into the line up.  It was at a good price so I ordered the bottle and it has lasted a long time since I  don&#x27;t use it every day. The shipping was fast and safe.</li>
            <li> My first review EVER: Literally just received this from UPS on 4/5/13 about 4:30PM PST.....I have owned K.C. Black for years and it is my favorite cologne, I only wear it once every month or two (for special times) to conserve it.....So anyway, I took a chance on purchasing this at $28.99 + tax because it was shipped from AMAZON, I figured well if they&#x27;re shipping it, they&#x27;re backing the product. I opened the package it was shipped in and removed the film from the cologne box, first thing I noticed was the box appeared to be a blueish tinge and NOT black (not an alarm because I&#x27;ve had the same bottle for years and don&#x27;t remember what the box looked like). Anywho, I sprayed it and immediately noticed it smelled kiiiiiiiind of like the real thing but nowhere near the potency. I then grabbed my original Black cologne bottle and compared the two, below are the differences:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. the caps &#x3D;&amp;#62; Original -  plastic with a tin-type shell&lt;br /&gt;  *Knock off - complete plastic with an extra lip that requires more uumpf to close and open&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. the lettering on the bottle &#x3D;&amp;#62; Original - the dash in front of the Kenneth Cole is &#x27;bolder&#x27; and the &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; in Cole has a closed loop at the top&lt;br /&gt;  *Knock off - the dash in front of the Kenneth Cole is &#x27;slimmer&#x27; and the &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; in Cole has an open loop at the top&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The bottle &amp; sticker on the bottom &#x3D;&amp;#62; Original- Distributed by Lancaster Paris New York NY (with Black - Kenneth Cole logo) and bottle &amp;#34;made in france&amp;#34; emblazoned&lt;br /&gt;  *Knock off - Distributed by Coty Prestige (no logo and the bottom of bottle not emblazoned)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. the smell &#x3D;&amp;#62; Original - awesome&lt;br /&gt;  *Knock off - eh after a few squirts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the description if I remember correctly stated that the packing may vary from the actual product.....I took that as the real deal K.C. Black may come in a non box &amp; could be a tester.....NOT that it would be imitation cologne &amp; in an imitation bottle (maybe this is legit legal terms that are in a gray area)! Either way, disappointed in Amazon for shipping a product that they did not check first and WILL BE ALERTING the REAL KENNETH COLE COMPANY.(maybe this is legit legal terms that are in a gray area)! Either way, disappointed in Amazon for shipping a product that they did not check first and WILL BE ALERTING the REAL KENNETH COLE COMPANY.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my boyfriend because he had been looking at this item, so I bought it for him as a surprise and Oh my goodness he always smells sooooo good!!!!! Love this item!</li>
            <li> Like the fragrance but it doesn&#x27;t last long at all.  Had it before and it was fine,but I got either a knockoff or a very old bottle</li>
    </ol>
