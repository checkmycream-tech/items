            <li>Wind Song is one of the most delightful smelling body sprays that I own but a 5 oz can cost only 99 cents in retail stores</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s so light</li>
            <li>review is only on the product, not the seller who was great.</li>
            <li>And the delivery (standard) time was exceptional, almost overnight.</li>
            <li>This fragrance brings back memories of the 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;It is refreshing and light, but smells sort of cheap as compared to more modern floral fragrances.&lt;br</li>

            <li>I usually pick this up at Wal-Mart, but decided to order on line and get more cans of it at a time and not have to go to walmart.</li>
            <li>an old standby!</li>
            <li>It is less noticeable than harsh perfumes and the body spray version is easy to apply without putting too much on.</li>

            <li> Wind Song has been around my whole life and I had never used it before, but the body spray is wonderful.  Just enough lingering fragrance, not overpowering.  And the delivery (standard) time was exceptional, almost overnight.</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling body spray I have ever used. It is not to heavy but stays smelling great all day so i don&#x27;t have to reapply.</li>

            <li> Great smell, not too over powering, and just gives a hint of it&#x27;s earthy scent. Reasonably priced and the smell lasts for quite some time</li>
            <li> I have used the body spray for several years like the powder. Again, it has a very light fragrance not sweet smelling or over powering.I receive compliments on this as well.</li>
            <li> This Wind Song fragrance is the most delightful scent I have ever smelled. It is so light and airy and reminds me of spring. It is less noticeable than harsh perfumes and the body spray version is easy to apply without putting too much on. The fragrance has been around forever (at least 20 years I think) and is absolutely timeless! I love this product and can say its my favorite. So affordable.

            <li> This is, and always have been my favorite body spray. It smells so fresh, not overpowering. I&#x27;ve been wearing this body spray since I was a teenager and it&#x27;s still a winner in my book.</li>

            <li> Love, love, love this Windsong body spray. The fragrance is not too strong yet pleasant and clean. It was packed well with the cap reinforced to prevent&lt;br /&gt;accidental leakage. I will be ordering more in the future.</li>

            <li> Forgot how much I loved this in the 80&#x27;s, love the clean smell. It is my everyday perfume, I save my good stuff for special occasions.</li>
            <li> This is the only body spray that I use.  It&#x27;s so light and it smells good.  Everywhere I go people (especially women) ask me what is that fragrance I&#x27;m wearing?  The product was packaged well, and it arrived within the stated time.</li>

            <li> I thoght that its small, but I get surprised when I see&lt;br /&gt;The size is good, but the smell not bad.</li>
            <li> This was a gift from my husband and he was under the impression when he ordered it that it was a fragrance spray (perfume).  It is actually a deodorant spray not a perfume spray.  Disappointing.</li>
            <li> This does what it is supposed to do, but not sure if I will use it as much as I thought I would.  Works well, and the fragrance is very light.  Nice in the closet and in a lingerie drawer.</li>
