            <li>Seems to give my hair more body and feels fuller.  </li>
            <li>The prices here are significantly better than the price in the salon and the product is identical.</li>
            <li>When I smelled this at my hairdresser&#x27;s place, I fell in love.</li>
            <li>At first it seemed kind of drying, but after a couple of uses I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice smell and makes my hair squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy she did, because this is far better.</li>
            <li>Shampoo is does not make the hair feel clean even after two shampoos!  </li>
            <li>The shampoo does a good job washing my hair and leaves it ready for the conditioner.</li>
            <li>Not to mention it allows me to comb my hair easily, therefore minimizing breakage.</li>
            <li>After washing, hair looks thicker, but easily manageable.</li>
            <li>makes me easy to put on the wax on my hair.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product and I love the scent, but I do notice that the large bottles seem to have a thinner consistency than the smaller ones.</li>
            <li>It makes my fine hair look fuller and thicker.</li>
            <li>Way easier to apply, costs more but worth it.</li>
            <li>Redken&#x27;s \\&quot;Smooth Down\\&quot; makes my scalp oily</li>
            <li>Great price, too, especially compared to beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li>Fantastic stuff.</li>
            <li>Really nice scent cleans hair very well without stripping everything out.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair feeling clean but it is still easy to comb out without using conditioner.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>The one I bought was for fine hair, full body.  </li>
            <li>Have used it for a long time and this was a great deal.</li>
            <li>did not make my hair feel clean and it didn&#x27;t do what it said my hair was not thicker and would not spend the money on this product again</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair feel soft and is perfect for flat hair.  </li>
            <li>Not so special.</li>
            <li>This is true of bottles that I have purchased in the salon and online, so I think it may be a manufacturing thing.</li>
            <li>Shipping was good - no issues with the vendor, but the product left a waxy residue in my hair at the roots.</li>
            <li>Redken Body Full Shampoo leaves your hair smelling good and definitely adds volume.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing, because increasing the time between shampoos/heat styling and use of a light heat protecting spray \\&quot;It&#x27;s a Ten\\&quot; has only increased the health and shine of my hair.</li>
            <li>First time to try this shampoo and not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Grassy, clean, crisp.</li>
            <li>Redken Body Full Shampoo does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo was recommended by my hairdresser, who tried to push me to buy it at her salon on sale (but still at a high price level), I decided to find it at a more reasonable price - and I did here.</li>
            <li>My hair is silky soft and light weight, and if I were the type to do much styling, I think it would be easy to do.</li>
            <li>Leaves the hair soft and smooth and full of body.</li>
            <li>I do use a very large toothed comb.</li>
            <li>But this time, I might buy the same one again :)</li>
            <li>Love the bulk price, last forever</li>
            <li>Makes me look like I have a lot more hair than I actually have.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an avid Redken fan because they can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>So glad there is finally a shampoo for fine/flat hair.</li>
            <li>Redkin is a good name and not cheap.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly have fine hair (actually more dry and poufy after blow drying), but I love that neither the shampoo or conditioner weighs down my hair.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>However, the shampoo did absolutely nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li>I can really tell a difference if I use anything else.  </li>
            <li>It arrived so much sooner than anticipated.</li>
            <li>Thanks Deva.</li>
            <li>I really do like it.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that tends to be oily and flat.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it for fine, flat hair.</li>
            <li>I can extend the time between shampoos more than even every other day.</li>
            <li>I have used it without a conditioner and was able to comb my hair when wet quite easily, which I couldn&#x27;t do with other shampoos of this type.</li>
            <li>Redken Body Full Shampoo works well for folks with fine limp hair like mine !</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older, there has been some thinning.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Thought I could decant it into my smaller container instead of dealing with the large size in the shower.</li>
            <li>Not heavy, works well on my hair .</li>
            <li>and I can use it frequently.</li>
            <li>This shampoo definitely adds a little volume to your hair and in addition, it also leaves some beautiful texture on your hair not just the day of shampooing but the next and the next as well (as long as you don&#x27;t sweat too much by working out heavily).</li>
            <li>I have very fine and thin hair due to taking a lot of medication that has sucked the life right out of my hair.</li>
            <li>I have long straight oily hair.</li>
            <li>I had to stop using it though because I&#x27;m apparently allergic to something in it.  </li>
            <li>Many weigh my hair down so it is limp and lifeless.</li>
            <li>; Yes, it was making my thick, fine, wavy hair a dry frizzy</li>
            <li>Every since I cut my long hair to be short, I&#x27;ve had trouble finding the right &amp;#34;weight&amp;#34; of products.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair, paired with not having a lot of it.</li>
            <li>I have fine thin hair.</li>
            <li>I have thin and baby fine hair</li>
            <li>more shine and less of a dull flat look.</li>

            <li> My hair is less oily and I&#x27;m only needing to wash 3 times a week as oppose to every day</li>
            <li> Sadly, like so many &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34; products out there, it is very harsh and stripping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on the lookout for a shampoo that will give my hair a little oomp if possible.  </li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this shampoo after I expressed disappointment that the \\&quot;Light Moisture\\&quot; line had been discontinued.</li>

            <li> This was for my husband, he was disappointed in the product and feels the shampoo is not as described</li>
            <li> Terrible product for me.</li>
            <li> This shampoo was the worst.</li>

            <li> Been using this forever, Great for my hair.</li>
            <li> Smells great, feels great, does it&#x27;s job...yup you guessed it! Great!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this shampoo. I have fine, thin hair, paired with not having a lot of it. I am always looking for ways to make my hair appear more plentiful. This shampoo adds just what I need without weighing my hair down or leaving a residue behind. I actually get comments from my hair dressers about the health of my hair and how it has no damage or build-up. That is enough to give it five stars in my book! Not to mention it allows me to comb my hair easily, therefore minimizing breakage.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I have fine thin hair. It is the only product that adds fullness and body without damaging my hair.</li>
            <li> First time to try this shampoo and not disappointed. Not heavy, works well on my hair . Highly recommend. Will definitely purchase again. Amazon makes shopping so easy!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo.  I have very fine hair and it makes my hair manageable.  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with product and delivery</li>
            <li> Terrible product for me. Redkin is a good name and not cheap. I have long straight oily hair. I am trying to find a good shampoo that will help. I am allergic to coconut so that&#x27;s out. This shampoo was the worst. My hair felt terrible it was oily and itchy. After 2 days of shampooing my hair was so oily and itchy it looked like I hadn&#x27;t wash my hair in over a week.  There was no pleasant smell. In fact there was no smell.</li>
            <li> I have very fine and thin hair due to taking a lot of medication that has sucked the life right out of my hair. I&#x27;m always on the lookout for a shampoo that will give my hair a little oomp if possible.  This product did not give my hair any volume, and it dried it out too much.  Will not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product by my hairdresser.  I have fine hair that tends to be oily and flat.  This product does not weigh it down.  It has a nice smell and makes my hair squeaky clean.  My hair does not get too dry from this shampoo and I can use it frequently. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair product.</li>
            <li> I am always in a look out for a good shampoo and keep changing it every time. But this time, I might buy the same one again :) This shampoo definitely adds a little volume to your hair and in addition, it also leaves some beautiful texture on your hair not just the day of shampooing but the next and the next as well (as long as you don&#x27;t sweat too much by working out heavily). Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This shampoo was recommended by my hairdresser, who tried to push me to buy it at her salon on sale (but still at a high price level), I decided to find it at a more reasonable price - and I did here. However, the shampoo did absolutely nothing for my hair. I did not see any difference, whatsoever. I will use us this bottle but doubt that I will ever buy it again.</li>
            <li> Every since I cut my long hair to be short, I&#x27;ve had trouble finding the right &amp;#34;weight&amp;#34; of products. Many weigh my hair down so it is limp and lifeless. This seems to be perfect. My hair is silky soft and light weight, and if I were the type to do much styling, I think it would be easy to do.</li>
            <li> Shampoo is does not make the hair feel clean even after two shampoos!  Won&#x27;t buy their&lt;br /&gt;products again, not used to having shampoo twice.</li>
            <li> Love the bulk price, last forever or it seems, have been using it for years won&#x27;t use anything else, had to always wait for sales on the smaller sizes, not anymore</li>
            <li> So far so good. My hair is less oily and I&#x27;m only needing to wash 3 times a week as oppose to every day</li>
            <li> Redken Body Full Shampoo does exactly what it says.  Makes me look like I have a lot more hair than I actually have.  I threw out all the shampoos on hand and will only use this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid Redken fan because they can&#x27;t be beat. This product makes my hair feel soft and is perfect for flat hair.  This seller is excellent-highly recommend/Great Communication/ Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li> it clarifies your hair with out feeling weighted down. more shine and less of a dull flat look. good for fine hair</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. However,I will find some other place to obtain it. Ordered shampoo on oct 26 and did not receive it until November 24!</li>
            <li> This stuff seems to work. Way easier to apply, costs more but worth it. Ordering a case for next season!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair look thicker as advertised but it cleans it.</li>
            <li> I have thin and baby fine hair and this is the only shampoo for me.  I can really tell a difference if I use anything else.  Seems to give my hair more body and feels fuller.  Can&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> This is amazing shampoo!!  It makes my fine hair look fuller and thicker.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and I love the scent, but I do notice that the large bottles seem to have a thinner consistency than the smaller ones. This is true of bottles that I have purchased in the salon and online, so I think it may be a manufacturing thing. The prices here are significantly better than the price in the salon and the product is identical.</li>
            <li> did not make my hair feel clean and it didn&#x27;t do what it said my hair was not thicker and would not spend the money on this product again</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this shampoo after I expressed disappointment that the \\&quot;Light Moisture\\&quot; line had been discontinued. I&#x27;m happy she did, because this is far better. I don&#x27;t particularly have fine hair (actually more dry and poufy after blow drying), but I love that neither the shampoo or conditioner weighs down my hair. I can extend the time between shampoos more than even every other day. It&#x27;s amazing, because increasing the time between shampoos/heat styling and use of a light heat protecting spray \\&quot;It&#x27;s a Ten\\&quot; has only increased the health and shine of my hair. Redken&#x27;s \\&quot;Smooth Down\\&quot; makes my scalp oily and I have to wash and dry every day, but not so with \\&quot;Body Full\\&quot;.  Amazing!</li>
            <li> Not so special. This was for my husband, he was disappointed in the product and feels the shampoo is not as described</li>
            <li> Shipping was good - no issues with the vendor, but the product left a waxy residue in my hair at the roots.</li>
            <li> Redken Body Full Shampoo leaves your hair smelling good and definitely adds volume.  I have used it without a conditioner and was able to comb my hair when wet quite easily, which I couldn&#x27;t do with other shampoos of this type. I do use a very large toothed comb. Poured it into a smaller container which was easier to use in the bathtub. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband, and he&#x27;s very satisfied. It arrived so much sooner than anticipated. Great price, too, especially compared to beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> Cleans hair and removes residue.  Can&#x27;t find it locally anymore.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this for his thin hair. Fantastic stuff. Will definitely order again when we eventually run out of it.</li>
            <li> Thought I could decant it into my smaller container instead of dealing with the large size in the shower. NO way to do that. Then I see that it is not returnable....Thanks Deva. I will look else where for my Redken products in the future</li>
            <li> I thought shampoo was shampoo, until I used this. I smalled amount needed when shampooing and I did notice a difference.  After I dried my hair, it was soft without conditioner and felt lighter. The one I bought was for fine hair, full body.  I really do like it.</li>
            <li> When I smelled this at my hairdresser&#x27;s place, I fell in love. Grassy, clean, crisp. Mmm. That&#x27;s what the two stars are for...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as for the performance of this shampoo, nope. Sadly, like so many &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34; products out there, it is very harsh and stripping. This is one way to get volume, I guess, but not the kind you want. There are some very harsh sulfates in this stuff. When I told my hairdresser what I was using, she said &amp;#34;stop.&amp;#34; Yes, it was making my thick, fine, wavy hair a dry frizzy mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bummer. I still steal a sniff every once in a while in the store...if only it worked for me.</li>
            <li> Really nice scent cleans hair very well without stripping everything out. Leaves the hair soft and smooth and full of body.</li>
            <li> I have baby hair, this product is excellent because it gives fullness and body&lt;br /&gt;I am so please that strngly recomend it</li>
            <li> This product was introduced to me by my hairdresser, and now I can purchase it from Amazon at a good price.  I recommend it for fine, flat hair.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a big difference in my hair using this shampoo. I will continue to use it from now on. I like the size of the bottle too.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo and I do think that it added some volume to my hair.  I had to stop using it though because I&#x27;m apparently allergic to something in it.  I started getting little zits on my scalp after I started using this.  I would still recommend it since I like the shampoo and haven&#x27;t heard of anyone else having this issue.</li>
            <li> Learned of this product while in my beauty shop. So glad there is finally a shampoo for fine/flat hair. The shampoo does a good job washing my hair and leaves it ready for the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Very nice and very pleasant fragrance.  I read about other people who thought it was drying. At first it seemed kind of drying, but after a couple of uses I am very pleased. Nice shampoo and my hair has body!</li>
            <li> This Redken shampoo for fine hair does a great job.  Leaves your hair feeling clean but it is still easy to comb out without using conditioner.  Definitely adds volume.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  Have used it for a long time and this was a great deal.</li>
            <li> Redken Body Full Shampoo works well for folks with fine limp hair like mine !</li>
            <li> Ive always had a thick head of hair. As I&#x27;ve gotten older, there has been some thinning. After washing, hair looks thicker, but easily manageable.</li>
            <li> it is like what it says. after using this shampoo, my hair feels like in the air.&lt;br /&gt;it saves my flat hair a lot! makes me easy to put on the wax on my hair. also, it wont dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;strong recommend.</li>
            <li> Great service and product.  Thank You!</li>
