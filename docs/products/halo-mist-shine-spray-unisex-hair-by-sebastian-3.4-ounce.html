            <li>I simply love it!</li>
            <li>It made my hair look shiny and healthy!</li>
            <li>really nice, gives the hair a nice shine.</li>
            <li>The Halo Mist adds a really nice shine and smoothness to your style.</li>
            <li>I use this when I don&#x27;t use the thermal protection spray by Sebastian because that product leaves my hair with a nice healthy shine</li>
            <li>Amazon price was better anyway.</li>
            <li>I love this product....</li>
            <li>This does add shine and I am pleased with the product performance.  </li>
            <li>You will not find a better shine spray ....</li>
            <li>It is a light mist that you spray on and the shine is amazing.  </li>
            <li>But just in case, I won&#x27;t be going through this seller for any more products.</li>
            <li>I love the natural bright and the softness that this product leaves my hair and keeps it even with humidity</li>
            <li>recommended me Paul Mitchell super skinny serum, Sebastian reshaper spray and of course halo mist!</li>
            <li>Slightly different than original mist sold in tin container, but works fairly well.</li>
            <li>This is a very good styling tool read the reviews before ordering, not able to find it in the stores so order online.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and after using this product my hair was straight and bouncy.  </li>
            <li>this product is great to any style after my hair is dried I spray this</li>
            <li>I love HALO MIST, when i spray Halo Mist on my kinda of over chemically processed hair, my hair brightens up with a natural shine not oily shine.</li>
            <li>and they were right.</li>
            <li>Another spritz after the hair is dry makes it have a nice shine.  </li>
            <li>but gently does it!</li>
            <li>So I used similar squirt bottle top from another home product</li>
            <li>After using the product my hair has a nice shine and not weighed down.  </li>
            <li>Makes your hair very shiny.  </li>
            <li>So, I stopped using it and went back to Smooth&#x27;N Shine Polishing Spray which is quite a bit cheaper - also from Amazon of course.</li>
            <li>The spray delivers too much product &amp;#34;apply with fingertips only&amp;#34; - that&#x27;s what they told me at Sassoon Academy</li>
            <li>Mostt of all, very often am asked if am wearing a wig.  </li>
            <li>so the missing piece could have been from the manufacturer although it looked like the kind of tape I have in my home.</li>
            <li>I use this daily and am not disappointed in it&#x27;s end result.</li>
            <li>I have dull gray hair and this is the best for putting the shine in with out the weighing your hair down</li>
            <li>Less is more.</li>
            <li>Very light doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair!</li>
            <li>This makes my longish straight brown and gray hair look healthy without making it feel greasy or stiff.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I really wanted something that would add shine to my hair without weighing it down (I have fine hair and it is easily weighed down).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many of these type products and they usually leave the hair greasy.</li>
            <li>If you want shine but not heavy oil</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly (finer side) hair and spraying this directly on my hair leaves it feeling oily.</li>
            <li>It was just a tube sticking out of the bottle with no little plastic piece to press your finger onto for you to spray it.</li>

            <li> leaves hair greasy feeling, and that&#x27;s with just 2 small spritzes&lt;br /&gt;disappointed</li>
            <li> Makes your hair very shiny.  Found it at TJMaxx and there was no more.  Amazon price was better anyway.</li>
            <li> really nice, gives the hair a nice shine.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. If put on while the hair is wet it leaves it shiney and soft when it is dry. Another spritz after the hair is dry makes it have a nice shine.  I&#x27;ve used many of these type products and they usually leave the hair greasy. This does not. UNFORTUNATELY, it is very difficult to wash out and I have to either use a harsh shampoo or my regular one 3 or 4 times to get this out of my hair. So, I stopped using it and went back to Smooth&#x27;N Shine Polishing Spray which is quite a bit cheaper - also from Amazon of course.</li>
            <li> Less is more. The spray delivers too much product &amp;#34;apply with fingertips only&amp;#34; - that&#x27;s what they told me at Sassoon Academy and they were right. I sprayed it once and it was way too greasy - looking. Great product, but gently does it!</li>
            <li> I love this product.... I am a professional and this is less expensive on Amazon.com than I can get it in the beauty supply. Just a spritz here and there after your hair is dried and styled and your hair has a beautiful shine...</li>

            <li> Not pleased with this product. I have naturally curly (finer side) hair and spraying this directly on my hair leaves it feeling oily. Works best if I spray into my hand and then apply for finish/shine bit have used other products for shine and finish that aren&#x27;t so oily.</li>
            <li> You will not find a better shine spray ....at any price....any where.....the price for three is ....well...amazing!</li>
            <li> Slightly different than original mist sold in tin container, but works fairly well.</li>
            <li> I love HALO MIST, when i spray Halo Mist on my kinda of over chemically processed hair, my hair brightens up with a natural shine not oily shine. Mostt of all, very often am asked if am wearing a wig.  HALO MIST is the only product i use, u dont need mouse, gel, heat protector spray</li>
            <li> Very light doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair! Love it!</li>
            <li> I really wanted something that would add shine to my hair without weighing it down (I have fine hair and it is easily weighed down).  This product is great.  It is a light mist that you spray on and the shine is amazing.  You can even run your fingers though your hair after using the product since it has no lacquer. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I simply love it! I have really long curly hair and I looked up on youtube how to straigthen out hair and the video I watched recommended me Paul Mitchell super skinny serum, Sebastian reshaper spray and of course halo mist! This spray is awesome! It made my hair look shiny and healthy! BUY IT!! :p</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the sprayer doesn&#x27;t work very well. I have straight, fine textured hair (not to be confused with thin hair), and the product itself seems to provide the shine I was looking for without adding extra weight. But the manufacturer should consider using a different sprayer to maximize product use.</li>
            <li> I have dull gray hair and this is the best for putting the shine in with out the weighing your hair down</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that it made my hair greasy AND flat. Oily but thin. Not that shiny with a lot of residue.</li>
            <li> I love the natural bright and the softness that this product leaves my hair and keeps it even with humidity</li>
            <li> I used this shine spray for a very important interview! My hair looked amazingly shiny! I haven&#x27;t quit using it!</li>
            <li> This is another great hair product by Sebastian I use this when I don&#x27;t use the thermal protection spray by Sebastian because that product leaves my hair with a nice healthy shine this product is great to any style after my hair is dried I spray this and I am set to go</li>
            <li> Halo Mist makes my silver hair sparkle!</li>
            <li> Just got mine last week. The Halo Mist adds a really nice shine and smoothness to your style. But I bought mine for $7.00 from CAN BUY ME BEAUTY and when I took the cap off (which was sealed with tape), I noticed the actual plastic piece from which the spray comes out, was missing. It was just a tube sticking out of the bottle with no little plastic piece to press your finger onto for you to spray it. The seller might have refunded or reimbursed me...I don&#x27;t know--because I didn&#x27;t attempt to get a refund because I didn&#x27;t want the trouble of shipping it back. So I used similar squirt bottle top from another home product so I could get it to work. Like I said, there was tape on it so the missing piece could have been from the manufacturer although it looked like the kind of tape I have in my home. But just in case, I won&#x27;t be going through this seller for any more products. Good product though, once you get to use it.</li>
            <li> ITS A REALLY GREAT PRODUCT BUT I PREFER APHOGHEE KERATIN AND GREEN TEA RECONSTRUCTOR SO I COULD ONLY GIVE IT A 4 INSTEAD OF A 5.</li>
