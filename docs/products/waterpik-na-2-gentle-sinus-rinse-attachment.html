    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is the best I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product at an excellent price.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe that they did that to promote their own sales!!!  </li>
            <li>I use Morton NON-iodized salt with warm water, and I use the Waterpik on the lowest setting (I use the nasal attachment with the WaterPik Model WP-60, and am very happy with it).</li>
            <li>Would work great, except...</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be as happy with yours as me and my family (and our extended families of sibs and parents) are with ours.</li>
            <li>ordered one for myself after I read about others&#x27; satisfaction with this product, and I am thrilled with the results!</li>
            <li>This is amazing.</li>
            <li>the variable speed of the pulses is handy.  </li>
            <li>Make your own...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s as good as it claims.</li>
            <li>however it proved very easy to use and</li>
            <li>my many years ordering from Amazon, I have found it&#x27;s best not to order any items with any type of shipping delay, as shipping almost always takes far longer than promised.  </li>
            <li>Great product for washing sinuses, I love it, Thanks to the innovator!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Be sure to use salt water though - once out of laziness</li>
            <li>After struggling for a couple of minutes, I was able to figure out how the sinus attachment worked.  </li>
            <li>Glad I found this product; I didn&#x27;t like the idea of a Neti Pot or bottle.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why Amazon can&#x27;t keep better track of their inventory.</li>
            <li>I was finally able to get out of that cycle by using this system of sinus irrigation.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>For great sinus relief the WaterPik Gentle Sinus Rinse attachment is the way to go!For those struggling with sinus problems, including infections, etc.</li>
            <li>After I used this product I felt like I could breathe more freely.</li>
            <li>I mix &#x27;morton non-iodized salt&#x27; and warm tap water right in the waterpik reservoir</li>
            <li>system is extremely easy to use.  </li>
            <li>strongly suggest any person with severe repeating Sinus infection to try this Waterpik system.</li>
            <li>The instructions are very easy to understand--it is a very simple process, but offers excellent results!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a good experience so far.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to get the right amount of salt to water (1/2 tbsp per cup) for a comfortable rinse.</li>
            <li>I clean each side leaning forward and afterward bend over moving your head side to side</li>
            <li>It keeps sinuses moist and clean - I&#x27;d recommend for those that have seasonal sinus problems</li>
            <li>/&gt;If one follows the instructions carefully, one can obtain great relief from sinus irritation and discomfort.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very easy to use and so far I have used it consecutively for 9 days.   </li>
            <li>It leaves you feeling refreshed and helps open your sinuses nicely.</li>
            <li>It is kind of gross at first, but if you do it consistently for several weeks, then just occaisionally if you feel something coming on, it is quite effective.</li>
            <li>this doesn&#x27;t fit my new WaterPik Ultra (WP-100).</li>
            <li>How sad to do that when this is the best thing around for allergy, chronic sinusitis, hayfever and asthma.  </li>
            <li>This product is effective, moreso than I expected!</li>
            <li>I found out that because of my allergies, my sinuses have formed their own pockets, which never really clean so my infections were often.</li>
            <li>battling sinus problems for years, I&#x27;ve found this sinus irrigation attachement for the WaterPik device to be very helpful.  </li>
            <li>Waterpik system with the Gentle Sinus Rinse works wonders.</li>
            <li>I use this sinus rinse every morning that I feel congested; it clears the sinus and nasal passages very efficiently.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame because I love the small footprint of the Waterpik Ultra, and it comes with a lot of cool attachments.</li>
            <li>With warm water and salt, relief will come in a matter of a few rinses.</li>
            <li>This seems like a major oversight on the part of the designers, as sinus irrigation doesn&#x27;t require that much water and the WP-360&#x27;s reservoir seems to be just about the right capacity for this task.</li>
            <li>It is like having a new lease on life--free of sinus problems!</li>
            <li>also highly recommend reading the book</li>
            <li>I purchased the Waterpik NA-2 gentle sinuse rinse attachment, expecting it to work with the Waterpik Professional Ultra Dental Water Jet, since that is what was advertised.</li>
            <li>this works pretty well but nowhere on the description does it indicate that it only works with WATERPIK devices.</li>
            <li>The whole process is a little gross, but better that in the privacy of your bathroom than constantly blowing your nose in front of friends, family and colleagues!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As opposed to the netti pot, it pushes the clog out of your sinus and helps clear things up.</li>
            <li>and this will clear out any sinus &#x27;pockets&#x27;</li>
            <li>The rubber tip on the nozzle forms a complete seal and</li>
            <li>THEY DON&#x27;T FIT IN THIS MODEL, SO DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR TIME PURCHASING</li>
            <li>So I bought the Waterpik wp-60w model for personal dental care and this Waterpik Gentle Sinus Rinse.</li>
            <li>price carefully on Amazon, they have the same product listed at many different prices.</li>
            <li>I purchased this set of attachments and a \\&quot;Waterpik NEW Professional Ultra Dental Water Jet\\&quot; from Amazon last week.</li>
            <li>was so pleased with this product, that I immediately ordered one for my father (who also suffers with allergies and sinus problems), and have told anyone that I know that suffers from these problems about this excellent product.</li>
            <li>use a saline solution consisting of pickling salt, baking soda and peroxide and it will return your normal Sinuses back to you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The person who complained that it didn&#x27;t fit their unit is not the owner of a Teledyne WaterPik Brand, but probably owns another Brand (perhaps Hydrofloss or Panasonic brands).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hopefully Waterpik will come up with something in the near future!</li>
            <li>need to pay for a more expensive model when the Waterpik wp-60w personal oral cleaning model AND the Waterpik Gentle Sinus rinse works so well.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the tip will fit only the water pik brand, and not others.</li>

            <li> /&gt;The person who complained of a &#x27;trip to the hospital&#x27; obviously mistakenly stuck their &#x27;high-pressure dental attachment&#x27; up their nose instead of this gentle sinus rinse.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The WaterPik Sinus Rinse attachment works just as well as the more expensive other brands.</li>
            <li> yes one might assume that but given the number of other similar waterpik like devices, one might not and the average shopper won&#x27;t read that far.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a sinus infection in a long time.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from constant sinus headaches, sinus pressure, sinus infections, mold allergies, and sinus problems due to humidity and changes in air pressure.</li>
            <li> The Sinus Cure:  7 Simple Steps to Relieve Sinusitis and other ear, nose, and throat conditions by Debra Fulghum Bruce and Murray Grossan,MD.</li>
            <li> This is only my opinion as I have had to rinse my sinus for 3 years, due to severe sinus infections.</li>
            <li> (According to this book, they recommend using the nasal irrigation system for at least 10 days to clear up your nasal passages, and to also restore your nasal cilia to their proper functioning.)</li>
            <li> I have dealt with a constant post-nasal drip for as long as I can remember, and this product is a big help in relieving that constant feeling of thick drainage going down the back of my throat.  </li>
            <li> Not really worth sending back to Amazon</li>
            <li> The person who wrote the negative review above (delisonhb) is actually a person who sells the brand they mentioned in their review on Ebay!  </li>
            <li> I have tried other nasal irrigation systems (specifically neti pots)</li>
            <li> I read about the expensive Grossan product and discovered it was first built using the Waterpik wp-60w model.</li>
            <li> floods-over and drips out the other nostril.</li>
            <li> I bought the wrong one and it wasn&#x27;t worth time &amp; trouble to return.</li>
            <li> while somewhat messy, it is no more so than other methods such as the neti pot.</li>
            <li> and this is hands down the easiest to use.  </li>
            <li> And if you don&#x27;t believe me, just look into the lastest medical findings that were published within the past year!</li>
            <li> Altogether at half the cost of the Grossan model.</li>
            <li> Being allergic year round,  this tool has helped me slim down my meds  to just flounase   from the drugstore I used to need.</li>
            <li> /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Since using this product my nasal congestion, sinus pressure, lightheadedness (due to allergies)--and even dark circles under my eyes--have disappeared!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid of this concept; water gently flows and fills-up one nostril, then</li>
            <li> I have canceled the item and ordered from another internet store and should receive this in a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried plain tap water and it felt just like it did</li>
            <li> Both tips in this set are too small.  </li>
            <li> Even if you are just prone to the common cold, this helps to end the sinus part of it quickly (and sometimes that ends the cold too</li>
            <li> I use the sinus rinse attachment  to help in cleaning my insides  after a dusty day in Upstate NY.  </li>
            <li> I was somewhat concerned that it would be difficult to use</li>
            <li> And for the person who said it felt like being hit with a wave...if you are leaning forward it won&#x27;t go into your throat silly goose.</li>
            <li> The base of the tip, the end inserted into the Waterpik handle, is too small.</li>
            <li> For people with really bad allergies this is an item you want to try.</li>
            <li> so I think I&#x27;ll just use my trusty Dremel tool and some plastic cement to swap the base with one of the tips that came with the Waterpik.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product for washing sinuses, I love it, Thanks to the innovator!</li>
            <li> This is the best I&#x27;ve ever had. After flossing and brushing my teeth, I used the waterpik dental jet I was surprise to see I had not flossed enough.</li>
            <li> Although the product information claims that this works with all models of WaterPik irrigation system, it does not work with the WP-360 Cordless WaterPik.  This seems like a major oversight on the part of the designers, as sinus irrigation doesn&#x27;t require that much water and the WP-360&#x27;s reservoir seems to be just about the right capacity for this task.</li>
            <li> I have tried other nasal irrigation systems (specifically neti pots) and this is hands down the easiest to use.  The rubber tip on the nozzle forms a complete seal and the variable speed of the pulses is handy.  The whole process is a little gross, but better that in the privacy of your bathroom than constantly blowing your nose in front of friends, family and colleagues!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to use salt water though - once out of laziness I tried plain tap water and it felt just like it did when, as a kid, I inhaled pool water!</li>
            <li> I have suffered from constant sinus headaches, sinus pressure, sinus infections, mold allergies, and sinus problems due to humidity and changes in air pressure. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This product is a \\&quot;miracle product!\\&quot;   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I ordered one for myself after I read about others&#x27; satisfaction with this product, and I am thrilled with the results! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to use and so far I have used it consecutively for 9 days.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Since using this product my nasal congestion, sinus pressure, lightheadedness (due to allergies)--and even dark circles under my eyes--have disappeared!! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was so pleased with this product, that I immediately ordered one for my father (who also suffers with allergies and sinus problems), and have told anyone that I know that suffers from these problems about this excellent product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I wish that I had known about this product years ago! It is like having a new lease on life--free of sinus problems! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I also highly recommend reading the book The Sinus Cure:  7 Simple Steps to Relieve Sinusitis and other ear, nose, and throat conditions by Debra Fulghum Bruce and Murray Grossan,MD. (According to this book, they recommend using the nasal irrigation system for at least 10 days to clear up your nasal passages, and to also restore your nasal cilia to their proper functioning.) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This system is extremely easy to use.  I use Morton NON-iodized salt with warm water, and I use the Waterpik on the lowest setting (I use the nasal attachment with the WaterPik Model WP-60, and am very happy with it). The instructions are very easy to understand--it is a very simple process, but offers excellent results! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> For people with really bad allergies this is an item you want to try. After I used this product I felt like I could breathe more freely.</li>
            <li> This product works as advertised. I was somewhat concerned that it would be difficult to use however it proved very easy to use and while somewhat messy, it is no more so than other methods such as the neti pot.</li>
            <li> This works if you just want to rinse out your nose of pollen and dirt, but it does not reach the sinus as the regular squeeze bottle.  This is only my opinion as I have had to rinse my sinus for 3 years, due to severe sinus infections.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Waterpik NA-2 gentle sinuse rinse attachment, expecting it to work with the Waterpik Professional Ultra Dental Water Jet, since that is what was advertised. THEY DON&#x27;T FIT IN THIS MODEL, SO DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR TIME PURCHASING BOTH TOGETHER! The sinus attachments are too short, so they can&#x27;t \\&quot;click\\&quot; into the water pik. The end result: Water leaks out, and there is no pressure through the sinus attachment. I had to return both items since the Amazon rep couldn&#x27;t find any sinus attachment to work in the Waterpik Ultra model. It&#x27;s a shame because I love the small footprint of the Waterpik Ultra, and it comes with a lot of cool attachments. Hopefully Waterpik will come up with something in the near future!</li>
            <li> I bought the Waterpik specifically for use with the Sinus Rinse attachment.  I have dealt with a constant post-nasal drip for as long as I can remember, and this product is a big help in relieving that constant feeling of thick drainage going down the back of my throat.  Make sure to get the right amount of salt to water (1/2 tbsp per cup) for a comfortable rinse.</li>
            <li> After struggling for a couple of minutes, I was able to figure out how the sinus attachment worked.  Since I haven&#x27;t used the WaterPik before, that was understandable.  It&#x27;s been a good experience so far.  Glad I found this product; I didn&#x27;t like the idea of a Neti Pot or bottle.</li>
            <li> This is amazing. As opposed to the netti pot, it pushes the clog out of your sinus and helps clear things up. I clean each side leaning forward and afterward bend over moving your head side to side and this will clear out any sinus &#x27;pockets&#x27; I found out that because of my allergies, my sinuses have formed their own pockets, which never really clean so my infections were often. I had no idea that was possible. but thank goodness for this cleaning...I haven&#x27;t had a sinus infection in a long time. Furhtermore, don&#x27;t worry about not &#x27;sanitizing&#x27; the water with baking soda. The issue with purchased saline, is the preservative in it.  Make your own...use KOSHER salt or SEA salt. 1 tsp to 500 ml of water. throw unused away.     And for the person who said it felt like being hit with a wave...if you are leaning forward it won&#x27;t go into your throat silly goose.</li>
            <li> Would work great, except...this doesn&#x27;t fit my new WaterPik Ultra (WP-100).</li>
            <li> My one star rating is for Amazon&#x27;s service, not the WaterPik attachment, which I never received.  Despite the fact that I ordered this on 20 February 2007 and shipping was stated to be 7-9 days (and is still stated to be 7-9 days), TWO weeks later Amazon has contacted me that shipping on this item will not be until 5-9 April 2007.  I have canceled the item and ordered from another internet store and should receive this in a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my many years ordering from Amazon, I have found it&#x27;s best not to order any items with any type of shipping delay, as shipping almost always takes far longer than promised.  I don&#x27;t understand why Amazon can&#x27;t keep better track of their inventory.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set of attachments and a \\&quot;Waterpik NEW Professional Ultra Dental Water Jet\\&quot; from Amazon last week. These tips will not work in this Waterpik. The base of the tip, the end inserted into the Waterpik handle, is too small. Both tips in this set are too small.  Not really worth sending back to Amazon so I think I&#x27;ll just use my trusty Dremel tool and some plastic cement to swap the base with one of the tips that came with the Waterpik.</li>
            <li> battling sinus problems for years, I&#x27;ve found this sinus irrigation attachement for the WaterPik device to be very helpful.  It keeps sinuses moist and clean - I&#x27;d recommend for those that have seasonal sinus problems</li>
            <li> I was a severe Sinus sufferer. I read about the expensive Grossan product and discovered it was first built using the Waterpik wp-60w model. So I bought the Waterpik wp-60w model for personal dental care and this Waterpik Gentle Sinus Rinse. Altogether at half the cost of the Grossan model. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This Waterpik system with the Gentle Sinus Rinse works wonders. This is an excellent product at an excellent price. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I strongly suggest any person with severe repeating Sinus infection to try this Waterpik system. Because it cleans the Sinuses so well, it may even prevent or stop colds and allergies. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I use a saline solution consisting of pickling salt, baking soda and peroxide and it will return your normal Sinuses back to you. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;No need to pay for a more expensive model when the Waterpik wp-60w personal oral cleaning model AND the Waterpik Gentle Sinus rinse works so well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shop price carefully on Amazon, they have the same product listed at many different prices.</li>
            <li> this works pretty well but nowhere on the description does it indicate that it only works with WATERPIK devices. yes one might assume that but given the number of other similar waterpik like devices, one might not and the average shopper won&#x27;t read that far.  &lt;br /&gt;It does work with some modifications though.  &lt;br /&gt;Stevie</li>
            <li> This product is effective, moreso than I expected! It leaves you feeling refreshed and helps open your sinuses nicely.</li>
            <li> Bought this, never used but not the fault of the attachment. I bought the wrong one and it wasn&#x27;t worth time &amp; trouble to return. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s as good as it claims.</li>
            <li> I have had chronic sinus infections for years. I was finally able to get out of that cycle by using this system of sinus irrigation. It is kind of gross at first, but if you do it consistently for several weeks, then just occaisionally if you feel something coming on, it is quite effective. It will even reduce the number of colds you get!&lt;BR&gt;My only complaint is that the tip will fit only the water pik brand, and not others.</li>
            <li> The person who wrote the negative review above (delisonhb) is actually a person who sells the brand they mentioned in their review on Ebay!  I cannot believe that they did that to promote their own sales!!!  How sad to do that when this is the best thing around for allergy, chronic sinusitis, hayfever and asthma.  Even if you are just prone to the common cold, this helps to end the sinus part of it quickly (and sometimes that ends the cold too, let me tell you).  Go ahead, buy one and you&#x27;ll be as happy with yours as me and my family (and our extended families of sibs and parents) are with ours. :)  And if you don&#x27;t believe me, just look into the lastest medical findings that were published within the past year!</li>
            <li> I use the sinus rinse attachment  to help in cleaning my insides  after a dusty day in Upstate NY.  Being allergic year round,  this tool has helped me slim down my meds  to just flounase   from the drugstore I used to need.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember ever ordering this.  I know I have never used it.</li>
            <li> I use this sinus rinse every morning that I feel congested; it clears the sinus and nasal passages very efficiently. I mix &#x27;morton non-iodized salt&#x27; and warm tap water right in the waterpik reservoir easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The person who complained of a &#x27;trip to the hospital&#x27; obviously mistakenly stuck their &#x27;high-pressure dental attachment&#x27; up their nose instead of this gentle sinus rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The person who complained that it didn&#x27;t fit their unit is not the owner of a Teledyne WaterPik Brand, but probably owns another Brand (perhaps Hydrofloss or Panasonic brands).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If one follows the instructions carefully, one can obtain great relief from sinus irritation and discomfort. Don&#x27;t be afraid of this concept; water gently flows and fills-up one nostril, then floods-over and drips out the other nostril.</li>
            <li> For great sinus relief the WaterPik Gentle Sinus Rinse attachment is the way to go!For those struggling with sinus problems, including infections, etc. this is the item that will help you. I was diagnose with severe sinus problems over 20 years ago and have been rinsing my sinus&#x27; ever since. I was given another brand by my doctor and told how to do it, and it is the only way I can get all the stuff out of my sinuses. Oh, sure it is weird pumping water up your nose, but think of jumping into a swimming pool. With warm water and salt, relief will come in a matter of a few rinses. The WaterPik Sinus Rinse attachment works just as well as the more expensive other brands.</li>
            <li> The water pik sinus attachment is the only thing that has given me the relief that I need. Living in the midwest you need help with your sinsus problems. Thank you water pik for helping me.</li>
