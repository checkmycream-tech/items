            <li>Not too strong.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have been looking for a good coconut bar.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Nubian Heritage for myself and my children.</li>
            <li>whatever they put in there to exfoliate) instead of the huge chunks they had embedded in the soap.</li>
            <li>The effect is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product for my sometimes bumpy skin as it exfoliates and moisturizes at the same time.</li>
            <li>I use the Nubian heritage Haitian Vetiver body lotion with it for perfectly smooth skin.</li>
            <li>I get out of the shower feeling so smooth &amp; silky</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>Smells great and has become the only soap I&#x27;ll be purchasing from now on!</li>
            <li>It has a light smell, so it&#x27;s not too fragrant.</li>
            <li>Wanted something eco/human friendly and this is the only soap I&#x27;ve ever found that doesn&#x27;t have any harmful ingredients (glycerin, parabens, sulfates) AND still works a great lather.</li>
            <li>Very fresh smell.</li>
            <li>it lathers well, rinses clean and leave you silky with a light vanilla scent</li>
            <li>First the smell is so good my dog wanted as much as I did and tried to eat the bar.</li>
            <li>It rinses right off and leaves my skin feeling smooth and clean!  </li>
            <li>All of the products I have tried from Nubian Heritage have been top of the line, I would absolutely recommend this to friends &amp; family!</li>
            <li>The lather is rich and the bar lasts and lasts.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is creamy, fragrant &amp; moisture rich.  </li>
            <li>leaves my skin with a rich scent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>we rarely even use body moisturizers with it!  </li>
            <li>Nice soap that feels much better than commercial bars.  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out, just clean, great smelling, &amp; moisturized.</li>
            <li>Rinses clean and leaves no residue in shower</li>
            <li>Smells nice, leaves skin soft, smooth...</li>
            <li>and still it rinses away clean.</li>
            <li>I feel clean and refreshed after using it.  </li>
            <li>Skin feels balanced and clean.</li>
            <li>And on top of that, it really makes your skin look fantastic.</li>
            <li>Leaves you feeling exceptionally clean, relaxed and</li>
            <li>It smells divine, and it leaves my skin clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Love it, I&#x27;ve tried all kind of soaps but this one above all</li>
            <li>Very light smell of coconut, very creamy, sudsy.</li>
            <li>I liked that everything used was all natural.</li>
            <li>The best soap for dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The soap was quickly delivered and it&#x27;s time to reorder.</li>
            <li>You save money this way, and they come straight to your door - great experience  - will be back!</li>
            <li>And the smell is mild and not chemically-smelling.</li>
            <li>Received quickly and packed with care.</li>
            <li>I have allergy issues and also dry out very easily from many soaps.  </li>
            <li>Gentle all natural soap with a mild exfoliate in generous sized bath bars great for whole family.</li>
            <li>Each bar also lasts a long time, which makes this soap fairly inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I have found a new love (Coconut &amp; Papaya soap)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy to have located it here for a bit less.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to put lotion or oil on my legs for the first time ever in my 59 years!  </li>
            <li>This soap has the most creamy suds and leaves my skin super soft.</li>
            <li>This soap has a light fragrance, not too much coconut or vanilla to offend.</li>
            <li>Great purchase all the way round.  </li>
            <li>I love Nubian Heritage and all of their soaps I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>Also this soap makes my skin dry when I first used it, but I thought it&#x27;s good for me since it&#x27;s &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; so I kept using it.</li>
            <li>Have tried other types that Nubian Heritage makes and loved them all.</li>
            <li>Everything we need is right here provided by who???</li>
            <li>Soap is soap, right?</li>
            <li>Keeps skin soft, hydrated all day long and smells great.</li>
            <li>The bar also last about twice a long as a regular bar of soap, so even with it costing more, it is still a good value!</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin smooth (not dried out and not sticky).  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not coming back :-).</li>
            <li>My favorite of the different blends.</li>
            <li>The body wash version actually smells better.  </li>
            <li>and the Olive Butter soap are my absolute favorites!</li>
            <li>I love trying different soaps</li>
            <li>However it smells great, last a long time and lathers well</li>
            <li>Firstly, the scent is ethereal.</li>
            <li>I really like this soap!  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin very soft and I feel like I am clean.</li>
            <li>and although it smelled refreshing and bright, my legs needed an extra rich body butter after my shower instead of the normal post bath oil I normally use after I wash with NH&#x27;s shea or black soap varieties.</li>
            <li>I have never felt my skin feel so clean and clear after a shower.  </li>
            <li>The soap has a clean smell to it not a heavy perfume smell.  </li>
            <li>I had used the honey and black seed soap as well and liked it very much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to describe what this soap does to your skin, but it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>Rinses very well and leaves the skin very hydrated!</li>
            <li>For those who suffer with winter skin (i.e., dry and itchy), you still have to use your favorite body lotion.  </li>
            <li>I have had mild adult acne for  years and after using this for months my face has cleared up.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is not overwhelming to the chemically sensitive person in the house which is a great bonus.</li>
            <li>Most bar soaps leave me dry and itchy over time.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this soap!</li>
            <li>my skin is much softer from using it.  </li>
            <li>I tried this soap, but there wasn&#x27;t much scent to it.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really smell like coconut, but</li>
            <li>I have been using this for over a year and it has really made a difference for me.</li>
            <li>I purchased it at Whole Foods for 3.99</li>
            <li>It works very well with clearing acne....</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film or residue on the skin, and it cleans very well.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t need it anyway, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>The scent is absolutely heavenly.</li>
            <li>I really like the scent of this soap.</li>
            <li>and I had ordered a six pack via after catching a whiff of it in my local Central Market in Shoreline WA.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, makes my skin soft without the white residue and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts like some moisturizing soap.</li>
            <li>But I must say my skin loves and responds very well to the ingredients in this soap, more than any other I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I use other soaps by Nubian Heritage, but the Coconut and Papaya is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I not only enjoyed the lack of &#x27;garbage&#x27; they put into regular soaps that is sans here, but love the smell and the benefits of smoother skin and less irritation.  </li>
            <li>of course the nontoxic ingredients are the main attraction.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recomment it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely hard to smell anything, which is alright for some, but for me I enjoy smelling that clean</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy the last few bars of coconut papaya soap have had smaller pieces of wood (or</li>
            <li>Additionally, it has an intense lather that is milky and soft and fragrant.</li>
            <li>before using these my skin was normal.</li>
            <li>because it never gets too soft and it is a huge bar that lasts a really long time!</li>
            <li>I used DOVE bar soap and body wash for so many years, as it was the only soap out there that did not aggravate my dry skin and eczema.  </li>
            <li>As of right now, this is the only soap that I am using...</li>
            <li>We have very sensitive skin and this soap doesn&#x27;t irritate us.</li>
            <li>One thing to note is that it becomes very soft and sheds a lot of soap if it is kept in a damp environment like a shower soap dish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all clear!  </li>
            <li>but once you use it the first time or apply water, the scent dissappates ... tried 2 bars and same results.</li>
            <li>I am very picky about my soap and only use high quality, natural soaps.  </li>
            <li>First opening the box, the coconut and papaya smell really came through, it was faint yet refreshing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Comparatively speaking, I absolutely love Nubian Heritage&#x27;s African Black Soap.  </li>
            <li>When I stopped using the soap for couple of days, it started to clear up.</li>
            <li>I definitely gets it &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean, but doesn&#x27;t dry it out like others would and</li>
            <li>I would never thought this natural soap would cause a breakout.</li>
            <li>my skin feels so soft after putting the Coconut &amp; Papaya lotion on.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Though, I think I am still too sensitive in my genital area to make a &amp;#34;Conrete&amp;#34; Decision.</li>
            <li>We have folks with sensitive skin in the house.</li>
            <li>Makes skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>for performance, the soap lathers well and was smooth, not too rough on the skin for the first few uses.  </li>
            <li>The smell is good, but the little fibers inside are kind of annoying.</li>
            <li>However, be aware that one the natural ingredients, perhaps it&#x27;s bark, has sharp edges that you do feel.</li>
            <li>If you have dry or sensitive skin, I highly recommend as the exfoliation is natural from the papaya and there are no added fragrances.</li>
            <li>We, as a family have been using this soap for almost a year now and everyone, (from 48 year old Mom with multiple allergies to 19 year old with some acne issues), likes this soap.</li>
            <li>They leave your skin feeling soft and never dry.  </li>
            <li>This is the only soap I can use on myself or my 11 month old daughter.</li>
            <li>It gives you such a clean feeling after a shower, it is unbelievable.  </li>
            <li>There are much more expensive soaps out there that advertise as natural, but still contain synthetic ingredients like titanium dioxide.  </li>
            <li>It does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and creamy and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my skin at all.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of this soap.&lt;br /&gt;There are small pieces of fiber that also make it slightly exfoliating.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin with slightly dry texture.  </li>
            <li>My husband and son suffer from extremely sensitive and dry skin in winter.  </li>
            <li>In the winter, our family experiences dry, itchy skin but this soap works so well to leave skin soft and supple</li>
            <li>Hold on tight to the bar as its very slippery.</li>

            <li> whatever they put in there to exfoliate) instead of the huge chunks they had embedded in the soap.</li>

            <li> This is a great product for my sometimes bumpy skin as it exfoliates and moisturizes at the same time.</li>

            <li> Enjoy.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin smooth and hydrated.</li>

            <li> It has a light smell, so it&#x27;s not too fragrant.</li>
            <li> Wanted something eco/human friendly and this is the only soap I&#x27;ve ever found that doesn&#x27;t have any harmful ingredients (glycerin, parabens, sulfates) AND still works a great lather.</li>
            <li> Very fresh smell.</li>
            <li> it lathers well, rinses clean and leave you silky with a light vanilla scent</li>
            <li> First the smell is so good my dog wanted as much as I did and tried to eat the bar.</li>
            <li> It rinses right off and leaves my skin feeling smooth and clean!  </li>
            <li> All of the products I have tried from Nubian Heritage have been top of the line, I would absolutely recommend this to friends &amp; family!</li>
            <li> The lather is rich and the bar lasts and lasts.  </li>
            <li> The lotion is creamy, fragrant &amp; moisture rich.  </li>
            <li> leaves my skin with a rich scent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> we rarely even use body moisturizers with it!  </li>
            <li> Nice soap that feels much better than commercial bars.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out, just clean, great smelling, &amp; moisturized.</li>
            <li> Rinses clean and leaves no residue in shower</li>

            <li> Leaves you feeling exceptionally clean, relaxed and</li>
            <li> It smells divine, and it leaves my skin clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Love it, I&#x27;ve tried all kind of soaps but this one above all</li>
            <li> Very light smell of coconut, very creamy, sudsy.</li>
            <li> I liked that everything used was all natural.</li>
            <li> The best soap for dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The soap was quickly delivered and it&#x27;s time to reorder.</li>
            <li> You save money this way, and they come straight to your door - great experience  - will be back!</li>
            <li> And the smell is mild and not chemically-smelling.</li>
            <li> Received quickly and packed with care.</li>
            <li> I have allergy issues and also dry out very easily from many soaps.  </li>
            <li> Gentle all natural soap with a mild exfoliate in generous sized bath bars great for whole family.</li>
            <li> Each bar also lasts a long time, which makes this soap fairly inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I have found a new love (Coconut &amp; Papaya soap)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy to have located it here for a bit less.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to put lotion or oil on my legs for the first time ever in my 59 years!  </li>
            <li> This soap has the most creamy suds and leaves my skin super soft.</li>
            <li> This soap has a light fragrance, not too much coconut or vanilla to offend.</li>
            <li> Great purchase all the way round.  </li>
            <li> I love Nubian Heritage and all of their soaps I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> Also this soap makes my skin dry when I first used it, but I thought it&#x27;s good for me since it&#x27;s &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; so I kept using it.</li>
            <li> Have tried other types that Nubian Heritage makes and loved them all.</li>
            <li> Everything we need is right here provided by who???</li>
            <li> Soap is soap, right?</li>
            <li> Keeps skin soft, hydrated all day long and smells great.</li>
            <li> The bar also last about twice a long as a regular bar of soap, so even with it costing more, it is still a good value!</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my skin smooth (not dried out and not sticky).  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not coming back :-).</li>
            <li> My favorite of the different blends.</li>
            <li> The body wash version actually smells better.  </li>
            <li> and the Olive Butter soap are my absolute favorites!</li>
            <li> I love trying different soaps</li>
            <li> However it smells great, last a long time and lathers well</li>
            <li> Firstly, the scent is ethereal.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap!  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin very soft and I feel like I am clean.</li>
            <li> and although it smelled refreshing and bright, my legs needed an extra rich body butter after my shower instead of the normal post bath oil I normally use after I wash with NH&#x27;s shea or black soap varieties.</li>
            <li> I have never felt my skin feel so clean and clear after a shower.  </li>
            <li> The soap has a clean smell to it not a heavy perfume smell.  </li>
            <li> I had used the honey and black seed soap as well and liked it very much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe what this soap does to your skin, but it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> Rinses very well and leaves the skin very hydrated!</li>
            <li> For those who suffer with winter skin (i.e., dry and itchy), you still have to use your favorite body lotion.  </li>
            <li> I have had mild adult acne for  years and after using this for months my face has cleared up.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is not overwhelming to the chemically sensitive person in the house which is a great bonus.</li>
            <li> Most bar soaps leave me dry and itchy over time.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this soap!</li>
            <li> my skin is much softer from using it.  </li>
            <li> I tried this soap, but there wasn&#x27;t much scent to it.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really smell like coconut, but</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a year and it has really made a difference for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased it at Whole Foods for 3.99</li>
            <li> It works very well with clearing acne....</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film or residue on the skin, and it cleans very well.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t need it anyway, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The scent is absolutely heavenly.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent of this soap.</li>
            <li> and I had ordered a six pack via after catching a whiff of it in my local Central Market in Shoreline WA.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, makes my skin soft without the white residue and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts like some moisturizing soap.</li>
            <li> But I must say my skin loves and responds very well to the ingredients in this soap, more than any other I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I use other soaps by Nubian Heritage, but the Coconut and Papaya is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I not only enjoyed the lack of &#x27;garbage&#x27; they put into regular soaps that is sans here, but love the smell and the benefits of smoother skin and less irritation.  </li>
            <li> of course the nontoxic ingredients are the main attraction.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recomment it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely hard to smell anything, which is alright for some, but for me I enjoy smelling that clean</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy the last few bars of coconut papaya soap have had smaller pieces of wood (or</li>
            <li> Additionally, it has an intense lather that is milky and soft and fragrant.</li>
            <li> before using these my skin was normal.</li>
            <li> because it never gets too soft and it is a huge bar that lasts a really long time!</li>
            <li> I used DOVE bar soap and body wash for so many years, as it was the only soap out there that did not aggravate my dry skin and eczema.  </li>
            <li> As of right now, this is the only soap that I am using...</li>
            <li> We have very sensitive skin and this soap doesn&#x27;t irritate us.</li>
            <li> One thing to note is that it becomes very soft and sheds a lot of soap if it is kept in a damp environment like a shower soap dish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all clear!  </li>
            <li> but once you use it the first time or apply water, the scent dissappates ... tried 2 bars and same results.</li>
            <li> I am very picky about my soap and only use high quality, natural soaps.  </li>
            <li> First opening the box, the coconut and papaya smell really came through, it was faint yet refreshing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Comparatively speaking, I absolutely love Nubian Heritage&#x27;s African Black Soap.  </li>
            <li> When I stopped using the soap for couple of days, it started to clear up.</li>
            <li> I definitely gets it &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean, but doesn&#x27;t dry it out like others would and</li>
            <li> I would never thought this natural soap would cause a breakout.</li>
            <li> my skin feels so soft after putting the Coconut &amp; Papaya lotion on.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though, I think I am still too sensitive in my genital area to make a &amp;#34;Conrete&amp;#34; Decision.</li>
            <li> We have folks with sensitive skin in the house.</li>
            <li> Makes skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> for performance, the soap lathers well and was smooth, not too rough on the skin for the first few uses.  </li>
            <li> The smell is good, but the little fibers inside are kind of annoying.</li>
            <li> However, be aware that one the natural ingredients, perhaps it&#x27;s bark, has sharp edges that you do feel.</li>
            <li> If you have dry or sensitive skin, I highly recommend as the exfoliation is natural from the papaya and there are no added fragrances.</li>
            <li> We, as a family have been using this soap for almost a year now and everyone, (from 48 year old Mom with multiple allergies to 19 year old with some acne issues), likes this soap.</li>
            <li> They leave your skin feeling soft and never dry.  </li>
            <li> This is the only soap I can use on myself or my 11 month old daughter.</li>
            <li> It gives you such a clean feeling after a shower, it is unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> There are much more expensive soaps out there that advertise as natural, but still contain synthetic ingredients like titanium dioxide.  </li>
            <li> It does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and creamy and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my skin at all.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell of this soap.&lt;br /&gt;There are small pieces of fiber that also make it slightly exfoliating.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin with slightly dry texture.  </li>
            <li> My husband and son suffer from extremely sensitive and dry skin in winter.  </li>
            <li> In the winter, our family experiences dry, itchy skin but this soap works so well to leave skin soft and supple</li>
            <li> Hold on tight to the bar as its very slippery.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap a lot ,subtle fragrance all natural organic ingredients .</li>
            <li> This soap, on the other hand, is 100% natural.  </li>
            <li> Bottom line, I am addicted to this soap and will never use anything else as long as this soap is available.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough.</li>
            <li> I have now used 3 of them and don&#x27;t see an improvement in my skin which is suppose to be brighter clearer it actually made my skin dry, yes</li>
            <li> Wanted to try something natural the way it should be as opposed to heavily perfumed bar soaps with lord knows what chemicals in them and</li>
            <li> I had skin issues for years that I could not clear up...</li>
            <li> I have to be careful what I use because my skin gets dry, especially during the winter</li>
            <li> Hubby even commented on this soap, after I bought it the first time and usually, he couldn&#x27;t care less what soap we have.  </li>
            <li> it seems almost the same as the black African soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also thrilled that it&#x27;s a pure product without nasty chemicals.</li>
            <li> It seems to last longer than the other unnatural soaps too.</li>
            <li> and I cannot use other commercial products on my face.</li>
            <li> Bars seem to last longer than other soaps.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin dry.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have dry skin anymore.</li>
            <li> Helps us avoid dry skin.</li>
            <li> Lately, though, I have been switching to natural products and stumbled upon this at my local vitamin store.  </li>
            <li> but this one does not make the mess in your shower stall like the African black soapI would recommend also purchasing the shea butter which is an extra moisturizing and will alleviate any dry skin feeling</li>
            <li> This soap doesn&#x27;t ever make me feel too dry!</li>
            <li> My fiance ordered this because she&#x27;s tried the lemongrass and African black soap.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it because one of the subscribers to the black African soap mentioned it was too drying to their skin</li>
            <li> I have dry skin due to dry winter air and pregnancy, so I am hoping it will help with that as I continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I will repost after having used it for a few weeks to see if there is any improvement to my extra dry, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> and I notice that my skin does not get dry like other products I have used to shower with.    </li>
            <li> The soaps were well packaged and delivered on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> The bar seems to last a little longer than other soaps.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as harsh against my skin when worn down a bit; it has just enough exfoliation.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to buying and trying other Numbian products.</li>
            <li> Not exactly.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin a little dry, but not as bad as some other cleansing soaps (I would prefer to have soap leave my skin a little dry and use lotion, rather than use a moisturizing soap that doesn&#x27;t rinse off cleanly, leaving my skin oily and filmy).</li>
            <li> as some other reviewers said it does leave typical soapy coating on your hands..</li>
            <li> Once the soap is worked down a bit and those thread like pieces of papaya</li>
            <li> My family and I don&#x27;t use any other soaps!</li>
            <li> The scent lasts a long time, and it does have little pieces of (well, I&#x27;m not sure), but they help exfoliate your skin some.</li>
            <li> Although I love coconut, I was afraid the smell might be overpowering, however it is a very delicate scent that goes with a variety of my perfumes.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I&#x27;ll be going back to their African Black soap.</li>
            <li> Once I used it, I wanted to stay in the shower another half hour just to keep smelling the fragrance in the steam.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t typically leave a review for a soap.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few soaps I can use on my face and not have an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> so it won&#x27;t go to waste.</li>
            <li> My wife has literally complained that when she rubs the soap on her arms, for example, she feels these sharp edges.</li>
            <li> Not sure of the claims of what it can do for my skin....</li>
            <li> It is expensive and we may try a few other brands to determine if this is the soap we stay with.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> It gave me a rash which is weird because I never get rashes from soaps.  </li>
            <li> This soap was recommended to me by my allergist and hasn&#x27;t disappointed</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used this soap for about a year and I absolutely love it. It seems to last longer than the other unnatural soaps too.</li>
            <li> Love love love the scent.</li>
            <li> I started using this soap for a month and pimples start to show up on my chest and some on the side of my neck. I NEVER EVER had pimples on the side of my neck. When I stopped using the soap for couple of days, it started to clear up. Also this soap makes my skin dry when I first used it, but I thought it&#x27;s good for me since it&#x27;s &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; so I kept using it. I would never thought this natural soap would cause a breakout.</li>
            <li> Nice soap that feels much better than commercial bars.  Wife loves it and will not go back to Irish Spring!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin with slightly dry texture.  I used DOVE bar soap and body wash for so many years, as it was the only soap out there that did not aggravate my dry skin and eczema.  Lately, though, I have been switching to natural products and stumbled upon this at my local vitamin store.  This is simply head and shoulders above DOVE soap.  Not only does it lather beautifully and smell pleasant, it leaves the skin squeaky clean with no harshness or greasiness.  I have never felt my skin feel so clean and clear after a shower.  I now use it to wash my face and have not had any breakouts.  The effect is fantastic.  There are much more expensive soaps out there that advertise as natural, but still contain synthetic ingredients like titanium dioxide.  This soap, on the other hand, is 100% natural.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin dry. The box is different, it doesn&#x27;t says skin brightening. It says nourishing, expoliating and renewing.</li>
            <li> Luv this soap. Great price ,and product. I will buy again and again. I recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> Wonderful soap. I have some for myself and give as gifts, everyone loves it.</li>
            <li> When this stuff clears my skin...</li>
            <li> I like the product.  It it a big bar.  Skin feels good and I don&#x27;t need lotion anymore.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It was initially prescribed by our doctor for healing of skin on legs after injuries. It worked great and now we continue to use it. It lathers well, smells great, doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky residue...I recommend and will buy it again</li>
            <li> i love this soap! it smells sooooo amazing. and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out, just clean, great smelling, &amp; moisturized. i&#x27;m so glad i took a chance and tried it</li>
            <li> Great soap!  Leaves my skin smooth (not dried out and not sticky).  For those who suffer with winter skin (i.e., dry and itchy), you still have to use your favorite body lotion.  But I must say my skin loves and responds very well to the ingredients in this soap, more than any other I&#x27;ve tried.  I will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> I waited a few weeks to post a review as I really wanted to see how this soap performed.  First opening the box, the coconut and papaya smell really came through, it was faint yet refreshing.  After using it in the shower, the scent practically disappeared.  It&#x27;s extremely hard to smell anything, which is alright for some, but for me I enjoy smelling that clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for performance, the soap lathers well and was smooth, not too rough on the skin for the first few uses.  Once the soap is worked down a bit and those thread like pieces of papaya (I guess?) start poking through, it was like rubbing sandpaper all over my skin.  The soap is extremely harsh, too much so, and left red marks along my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparatively speaking, I absolutely love Nubian Heritage&#x27;s African Black Soap.  It&#x27;s not as harsh against my skin when worn down a bit; it has just enough exfoliation.  The scent also does not fade like this coconut and papaya soap scent does.  Needless to say, I&#x27;ll be going back to their African Black soap.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this soap. I have to be careful what I use because my skin gets dry, especially during the winter and I&#x27;ve been using Dove for years! I decided to try this soap based on the ingredients. I liked that everything used was all natural. It&#x27;s hard to describe what this soap does to your skin, but it&#x27;s amazing! I definitely gets it &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean, but doesn&#x27;t dry it out like others would and my skin feels so soft after putting the Coconut &amp; Papaya lotion on.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry Dove. I&#x27;m leaving you. I have found a new love (Coconut &amp; Papaya soap) and I&#x27;m not coming back :-).</li>
            <li> Great product,  Great price!  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> The soap was quickly delivered and it&#x27;s time to reorder. The product is excellent.</li>
            <li> I have allergy issues and also dry out very easily from many soaps.  We, as a family have been using this soap for almost a year now and everyone, (from 48 year old Mom with multiple allergies to 19 year old with some acne issues), likes this soap. Hubby even commented on this soap, after I bought it the first time and usually, he couldn&#x27;t care less what soap we have.  Pleasant smell but very mild and doesn&#x27;t bother my many allergies. Buying it here saves us substantially over buying it at the health food store.</li>
            <li> I love this soap and was SO excited to see this pack of 6!! You save money this way, and they come straight to your door - great experience  - will be back!</li>
            <li> I bought this soap because I love coconut. The soap lathers beautifully and smells good too. I think it&#x27;s great for the skin and a great buy from AMAZON.</li>
            <li> Best soap we ever used. Soap lathers really well, great for body and face. Keeps skin soft, hydrated all day long and smells great. Great soap for nightly face wash.</li>
            <li> Good product, mild soap and smells good leaving you feeling clean</li>
            <li> Smells good and lathers well</li>
            <li> This is one of the few soaps I can use on my face and not have an allergic reaction. The bar seems to last a little longer than other soaps. Lathers well, too. I&#x27;m also thrilled that it&#x27;s a pure product without nasty chemicals. I highly recommend this soap!</li>
            <li> I love Nubian Heritage and all of their soaps I have tried so far. The coconut and papaya soap smells delightful and I had ordered a six pack via after catching a whiff of it in my local Central Market in Shoreline WA. I tried it in the shower after it arrived and although it smelled refreshing and bright, my legs needed an extra rich body butter after my shower instead of the normal post bath oil I normally use after I wash with NH&#x27;s shea or black soap varieties. I continue to use this as a hand soap only and my guests have commented on how pleasant smelling and nice it felt to use. Next time I will try a different variety by Nubian Heritage (although I might have to get the coconut papaya body butter if they have it just to use it with the soaps I have left!) but overall for the price I I paid online I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I &amp;#34;almost&amp;#34; wish I could eat this soap it smells so good! Great lather and is good for my skin.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product.  I use other soaps by Nubian Heritage, but the Coconut and Papaya is my favorite.  Smells great and my skin is much softer from using it.  The soaps were well packaged and delivered on time and as expected. I&#x27;d definitely order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> fantastic soap for all types of skin!  never drying but not oily either.</li>
            <li> The Nubian Heritage brand soaps are wonderful.  They leave your skin feeling soft and never dry.  The soap has a clean smell to it not a heavy perfume smell.  I have been using the coconut &amp; papaya and love it.  Have tried other types that Nubian Heritage makes and loved them all.</li>
            <li> I love this soap!  Smells like heaven and makes your skin feel wonderful.  All of the products I have tried from Nubian Heritage have been top of the line, I would absolutely recommend this to friends &amp; family!</li>
            <li> This soap has a light fragrance, not too much coconut or vanilla to offend. It is a great natural product as well. I am a huge fan of Nubian Heritage for myself and my children. This is a great product for my sometimes bumpy skin as it exfoliates and moisturizes at the same time. I use the Nubian heritage Haitian Vetiver body lotion with it for perfectly smooth skin.</li>
            <li> First the smell is so good my dog wanted as much as I did and tried to eat the bar. What the heck we both jumped in the shower and tried it out. Hold on tight to the bar as its very slippery. Suds and more suds of great smelling soap. Dog liked it and we smell and feel great. Will buy more.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. It does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I like it.  It builds a good lather and does a good job at cleansing oily skin, and it smells good.  It leaves my skin a little dry, but not as bad as some other cleansing soaps (I would prefer to have soap leave my skin a little dry and use lotion, rather than use a moisturizing soap that doesn&#x27;t rinse off cleanly, leaving my skin oily and filmy).</li>
            <li> It gave me a rash which is weird because I never get rashes from soaps.  My husband likes it though so it won&#x27;t go to waste.</li>
            <li> My favorite of the different blends. Rinses clean and leaves no residue in shower</li>
            <li> I love this soap and have been using it for years, its especially good for sensitive skin and I cannot use other commercial products on my face. The packaging was great and I see no reason to buy it from any local or health food stores again.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I use on my face.  I have had mild adult acne for  years and after using this for months my face has cleared up.  It&#x27;s not drying but I always use moisturizer anyway.  I would recommend this to anyone. For makeup removal I use this every night with the sonic type face cleaning unit.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, leaves skin soft, smooth... What more you can expect from soap... Excellent product which will stay on my list for future.</li>
            <li> The aroma of this soap is beautiful . I use it for my face or body . It softens my skin a bit .</li>
            <li> I tried this soap, but there wasn&#x27;t much scent to it.  I ended up using it for a hand soap.  It&#x27;s ok for bath, gives a good lather, not overly drying, I just like a soap with more scent.</li>
            <li> My fiance ordered this because she&#x27;s tried the lemongrass and African black soap.  This is not one of favorites.  It doesn&#x27;t really smell like coconut, but more like Play-Doh.  The body wash version actually smells better.  It&#x27;s also not as moisturizing as the lemongrass.</li>
            <li> I think this is one of the best soaps I have ever used.  It gives you such a clean feeling after a shower, it is unbelievable.  Made with good ingredients, it is a real winner.  I have used it for a couple of years now, and use it exclusively for all bathing.  Great product!</li>
            <li> The coconut &amp; papaya soap smells so wonderful, I could not stop sniffing it. This also lathers like you wouldn&#x27;t believe, you will have suds for days in the bottom of the shower even in the tub it&#x27;s like using bubble bath and still it rinses away clean. I get out of the shower feeling so smooth &amp; silky and you won&#x27;t have to rub oil or lotion on afterwards. Not only did it leave me moisturized, it prevented my skin from turning ashy as the day went on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This and the Olive Butter soap are my absolute favorites!</li>
            <li> Lovely soap Lovely scent! Gentle all natural soap with a mild exfoliate in generous sized bath bars great for whole family.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap and although the quality is great....it smells like play doh to me, which is a big turn off.  But my partner likes it so....to each their own.</li>
            <li> Smells delicious and my skin feels soft</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this soap.&lt;br /&gt;There are small pieces of fiber that also make it slightly exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a win win for me.</li>
            <li> Great lather &amp; it smells delicious.</li>
            <li> A good sized bar of soap! Not quite as great of a scent as some others that I prefer more. BUT, this is the best bar I&#x27;ve ever used in my soap scrubby wrap [[ASIN:B008AFCE8I Evriholder 630 2 Paradiso Lather Luxury]] because it never gets too soft and it is a huge bar that lasts a really long time!</li>
            <li> This is a great soap make the body feel so good and soft</li>
            <li> The best soap for dry, sensitive skin. I have been using this for over a year and it has really made a difference for me. The bar also last about twice a long as a regular bar of soap, so even with it costing more, it is still a good value!</li>
            <li> i like it it smell good</li>
            <li> Very nice soap.  I feel clean and refreshed after using it.  Tad bit drying but that&#x27;s ok.  I bought the matching lotion to go with it.  One reviewer said that it smells like play-doh.  I agree.  I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this soap. It is mild, smells nice, lathers well and has quality ingredients.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I can use on myself or my 11 month old daughter. We have very sensitive skin and this soap doesn&#x27;t irritate us. And the smell is mild and not chemically-smelling. This soap was recommended to me by my allergist and hasn&#x27;t disappointed</li>
            <li> Love the way this smells and the way it rinses off squeaky clean. Makes your skin smooth and soft and feeling great.</li>
            <li> I Love This Soap!!!!  Mmmmmmmm.............. It feels sooooooo ........... Good on my Skin!!  I&#x27;m so allergic!!!! It didn&#x27;t make me break out! But...... It really is the Best Soap I&#x27;ve &amp;#34;Ever&amp;#34; been able to use all over my body.  Though, I think I am still too sensitive in my genital area to make a &amp;#34;Conrete&amp;#34; Decision. Still, I&#x27;ve ordered sooooooo..... many specialty Soaps that I can honestly Say!!! This soap doesn&#x27;t ever make me feel too dry!</li>
            <li> Smells great and works well. Bars seem to last longer than other soaps.</li>
            <li> My favorite soap! Sudsy, and smells like a coconut shake :)</li>
            <li> Love this soap! Skin feels so soft and it leathers so good! I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Highly recomment it.</li>
            <li> It smelled heavenly even before I got it out of the packaging! Once I used it, I wanted to stay in the shower another half hour just to keep smelling the fragrance in the steam. I will repost after having used it for a few weeks to see if there is any improvement to my extra dry, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I had skin issues for years that I could not clear up... Dry/ acne/ rash... And within a week of using this soap... It&#x27;s all clear!  Thank you!  My roseacea is even better.  Stocking up to make sure I always have some on hand... I have even gifted to family and friends...</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  Before I was using Dove and my skin was itchy.  My skin feels a lot better since I started using this soap.  The smell is good, but the little fibers inside are kind of annoying.</li>
            <li> Soap smells and works really good</li>
            <li> Moisturizing soap that feels great on and rinses off beautifully.  Skin feels balanced and clean.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite soap! It doesn&#x27;t leave a film or a residue and smells delicious.</li>
            <li> love the smell of this so to me it seems almost the same as the black African soap. I purchased it because one of the subscribers to the black African soap mentioned it was too drying to their skin and they use this one to neutralize that however I find them to feel about the same but this one does not make the mess in your shower stall like the African black soapI would recommend also purchasing the shea butter which is an extra moisturizing and will alleviate any dry skin feeling</li>
            <li> Very nice smelling soap.  Not too strong.  Cleans well and has a nice abrasive inside.</li>
            <li> I love trying different soaps but if I had to pick just one to use it would probably be this one.  The smell is nothing short of yummy!  The lather is rich and the bar lasts and lasts.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, makes my skin soft without the white residue and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts like some moisturizing soap.</li>
            <li> The lotion is creamy, fragrant &amp; moisture rich.  Extravagantly lovely.  I&#x27;m a fan &amp; pleased that the lotion isn&#x27;t animal tested.  Received quickly and packed with care.</li>
            <li> Love the lather! Rinses very well and leaves the skin very hydrated!</li>
            <li> Very nice i iwll buy it again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I will only buy this soap from now on.  My husband and son suffer from extremely sensitive and dry skin in winter.  This soap is moisturizing and gentle, not to mention is smells amazing!! I&#x27;m looking forward to buying and trying other Numbian products.</li>
            <li> Reviews are accurate, this is best lathering soap, Dove and Oil of Olay included.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received many bars for a good price.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my skin with a rich scent.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have dry skin anymore.</li>
            <li> smells great worth every penny will order this soap again and again.</li>
            <li> Great purchase all the way round.  Prompt response, ALL GOOD!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before purchasing a set of these about 6. I have now used 3 of them and don&#x27;t see an improvement in my skin which is suppose to be brighter clearer it actually made my skin dry, yes granted I don&#x27;t always lotion after my shower but before using these my skin was normal. However it smells great, last a long time and lathers well but I will not be purchasing these in the future.</li>
            <li> Love this soap. Very light smell of coconut, very creamy, sudsy. Use it every day, love it has no chemicals!</li>
            <li> We are liking this soap. Very fresh smell. My skin seems to like the nourishing quality. I have very sensitive skin and have been looking for a good coconut bar.</li>
            <li> I tried this soap on a whim.  I purchased it at Whole Foods for 3.99 and I&#x27;m happy to have located it here for a bit less.  I not only enjoyed the lack of &#x27;garbage&#x27; they put into regular soaps that is sans here, but love the smell and the benefits of smoother skin and less irritation.  Enjoy.</li>
            <li> Helps us avoid dry skin. We have folks with sensitive skin in the house. This soap works for us without being overly drying. The fragrance is not overwhelming to the chemically sensitive person in the house which is a great bonus.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin smooth and hydrated. Nice lathering. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love this soap! it lathers well, rinses clean and leave you silky with a light vanilla scent</li>
            <li> I love, love, love, love this soap...As of right now, this is the only soap that I am using...It makes my skin very soft and I feel like I am clean. It works very well with clearing acne....I will buy again</li>
            <li> Love this soap! Wanted something eco/human friendly and this is the only soap I&#x27;ve ever found that doesn&#x27;t have any harmful ingredients (glycerin, parabens, sulfates) AND still works a great lather. Smell is nice too and company seems to treat employees well. Will be buying forever!</li>
            <li> I have had this type of soap before so I knew that it was a great cleanser, smells awesome and does not dry out my skin like detergent soaps. I would recommend the Nubian Soap line to anyone. My family and I don&#x27;t use any other soaps!</li>
            <li> ...I&#x27;d marry it. Seriously. Best. Soap. Ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap smells so delicious, that even if you don&#x27;t like to eat coconuts, you will probably ask yourself, \\&quot;Okay, self. Give me one good reason why I don&#x27;t like to eat coconuts. Because this smells delicious.\\&quot; It lathers up so nicely that I use it to shave (my legs, har har) with it and not have to worry about razor burn. It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film or residue on the skin, and it cleans very well. The scent lasts a long time, and it does have little pieces of (well, I&#x27;m not sure), but they help exfoliate your skin some. Sulfate-free, cruelty-free, paraben-free...what&#x27;s not to love? And on top of that, it really makes your skin look fantastic. My skin tends to break out, and once I switched over to Nubian Heritage products, my skin looked so much better! Every time I go to shower, I look forward to using their products. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re looking for a great soap that not only smells delicious but will make you clean and fabulous-looking, you&#x27;ve found it! :)</li>
            <li> Best soap ever I won&#x27;t use anything else</li>
            <li> I love this soap. of course the nontoxic ingredients are the main attraction. as some other reviewers said it does leave typical soapy coating on your hands.. but it is worth it, smells awesome and just seems nice  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> The soap is great, BUT the vendor has used sticky packaging tape to tape all of the bars together. So, when you try to separate each box/bar, you end up with extra work AND each box stays sticky from the tape. If you don&#x27;t mind ripped, sticky boxes of soap, you&#x27;re good. Once inside, the soap works and smells great - and it&#x27;s cruelty-free, too.</li>
            <li> Smells great and has become the only soap I&#x27;ll be purchasing from now on!</li>
            <li> Nubian Heritage makes great products. Love giving their soap as gifts. I&#x27;m really happy the last few bars of coconut papaya soap have had smaller pieces of wood (or whatever they put in there to exfoliate) instead of the huge chunks they had embedded in the soap. It really doesn&#x27;t need it anyway, in my opinion. The smell is divine too.</li>
            <li> The soap arrived on time.  I am very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Wanted to try something natural the way it should be as opposed to heavily perfumed bar soaps with lord knows what chemicals in them and wow...loving these bars and their aroma. Never will go back to &amp;#34;deodorant soaps&amp;#34; and their funky additives again. Everything we need is right here provided by who??? Mother Nature...the way it should be! Leaves you feeling exceptionally clean, relaxed and skin is nice and smooth. No itching or dryness.</li>
            <li> This soap is what I&#x27;ve been looking for! My skin loves it and it smells so good in a mild way.</li>
            <li> product is execellent, I will keep on using and keep on  using and odering it,  keep up the good work</li>
            <li> Love the smell and feel of this soap.  My wife is very pleased with this purchase.  It is expensive and we may try a few other brands to determine if this is the soap we stay with.</li>
            <li> I have to say I love the smell of this soap and how smooth it feels on my skin. However, be aware that one the natural ingredients, perhaps it&#x27;s bark, has sharp edges that you do feel. My wife has literally complained that when she rubs the soap on her arms, for example, she feels these sharp edges. I don&#x27;t quite understand why they are in there--you can see them--but they are. Just so you know.</li>
            <li> In the winter, our family experiences dry, itchy skin but this soap works so well to leave skin soft and supple we rarely even use body moisturizers with it!  It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> This soap lathers well. It has a light smell, so it&#x27;s not too fragrant. I have dry skin due to dry winter air and pregnancy, so I am hoping it will help with that as I continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t typically leave a review for a soap. Soap is soap, right? Not exactly. Not since I discovered this soap. I am very picky about my soap and only use high quality, natural soaps.  Firstly, the scent is ethereal. The scent is absolutely heavenly. Additionally, it has an intense lather that is milky and soft and fragrant. There are times that I don&#x27;t use body lotion because I am in a rush etc...and I notice that my skin does not get dry like other products I have used to shower with.    Bottom line, I am addicted to this soap and will never use anything else as long as this soap is available.</li>
            <li> The soap smells fantastic and leave s my skin feeling good. The smell reminds me of pina coladas, a good smell to start the day.</li>
            <li> Best Moisturizing Soap, I have been using this brand for years glad to see Amazon offering it at a great price.</li>
            <li> Great all natural soap. I had been trying different soaps for a while until I found this soap, which I&#x27;ve now been using for about 2 years. It smells good, lathers well, cleans well and causes no skin allergies. Each bar also lasts a long time, which makes this soap fairly inexpensive.</li>
            <li> It drys out your skin. I would definitely recommend it for people who have oily skin such as on the fac .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s winter and I don&#x27;t have to put lotion or oil on my legs for the first time ever in my 59 years!  This soap is so good for my skin and it smells wonderful and it&#x27;s organic! Win, win!</li>
            <li> I never thought I would love a bar soap like I love this. Most bar soaps leave me dry and itchy over time. This soap has the most creamy suds and leaves my skin super soft. Although I love coconut, I was afraid the smell might be overpowering, however it is a very delicate scent that goes with a variety of my perfumes. I had used the honey and black seed soap as well and liked it very much but this is the one for me. I purchased the 6 pack! If you have dry or sensitive skin, I highly recommend as the exfoliation is natural from the papaya and there are no added fragrances.</li>
            <li> , smells wonderful but once you use it the first time or apply water, the scent dissappates ... tried 2 bars and same results.</li>
            <li> Great product...will continue to purchase!!</li>
            <li> This is a great soap and I&#x27;ve used it for years.  It&#x27;s very soft and creamy and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my skin at all.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Best soap I have ever used (coconut is better than lavender one)</li>
            <li> It smells and lathers good. Makes skin feel so soft. I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery.  Love this soap,  lathers great and smells fresh and not overpowering</li>
            <li> Creamy, gentle and very nice aroma.  We love this soap!  Shipping was very fast; we purchased a five pack which is a great deal.</li>
            <li> This is the yummiest smelling soap with great ingredients.  I actually use it in my DIY laundry soap.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap!  It rinses right off and leaves my skin feeling smooth and clean!  Not sure of the claims of what it can do for my skin....I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizing soap. I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is my all-time favorite soap!  It smells divine, and it leaves my skin clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap a lot ,subtle fragrance all natural organic ingredients .</li>
            <li> I really like the scent of this soap. My girlfiend complains of itchiness in her chest when she uses this soap on the shower. I havent experienced it though. One thing to note is that it becomes very soft and sheds a lot of soap if it is kept in a damp environment like a shower soap dish.</li>
            <li> Love it, I&#x27;ve tried all kind of soaps but this one above all</li>
    </ol>
