            <li>At night I use more</li>
            <li>I love it  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>When I tried this cream 20 yrs ago, I fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>I Decided to look on line for a more affordable price.</li>
            <li>It is very powerful in terms of fighting dryness!</li>
            <li>but I also put a light cover under my make-up during the day.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money for the results you will be getting!</li>
            <li>Also my skin is kind sensitive and the cream works for me too!</li>
            <li>This product is great for very dry skin.</li>
            <li>Many thanks.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Always happy to find it at a slightly lower price.</li>
            <li>Get ready to be wowed!!</li>
            <li>Quite pricey, but worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I am 48 but the oldest guess for my age has been 33 and these are young people :-)</li>
            <li>Great for dry to normal skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s been a long time Shiseido user and her skin looks better than mine!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I just bought it, and it is exactly what it is supposed to be.</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>So much so that I ordered a container almost twice the size.</li>
            <li>The real deal.</li>
            <li>I am very picky with what I put on my face.</li>
            <li>The color of the actual item is more like gold than white.</li>
            <li>But for this one, the container is different from the one I bought before, the botton part is very loose and can be taken apart very easily.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical because of the great price, but once it arrived it was the same exact product I had been buying at local Shiseido stores for a much higher price.</li>
            <li>I do not understand, I have used this product for several years and just started using my new jar and my face is burning.  </li>
            <li>No loose bottom on the jar, either.</li>

            <li> I do not understand, I have used this product for several years and just started using my new jar and my face is burning.  I have had to take my makeup off and my face is spotty red.Have loved the makeup but now I do not know what to do.  Has anyone else had this problem?  I do not know how to rate it now???It would have been 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Really like this product. So much so that I ordered a container almost twice the size. My skin loves it, the fragrance is enticing! Don&#x27;t hesitate to try it!!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. The real deal.</li>
            <li> I use this cream in the winter, and a lighter Shiseido product for the summers.  Just works for me.  Always happy to find it at a slightly lower price.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and I appreciate the prompt arrival to my door. I will order again when needed. Many thanks.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream in a local store before and like it. But for this one, the container is different from the one I bought before, the botton part is very loose and can be taken apart very easily. I don&#x27;t feel the cream as the same as the one I bought before. In a summary, it&#x27;s suspicious to me. I will just buy it in local store or Shiseido&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li> I got mine from CF Link.  It is made in USA and exactly same as the one that I got from a retail store.  The color of the actual item is more like gold than white.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for years. This product is great for very dry skin. Skin feels supple overnight after using this before bed time.</li>
            <li> love the cream! I have been using this product for more than 10 years! It is very powerful in terms of fighting dryness! Also my skin is kind sensitive and the cream works for me too!</li>
            <li> Good product at a great price.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Good price, better than department store&#x27;s price</li>
            <li> My skin is chronically dry.  The Bio Performance is the only product I have found that counter-acts the dryness and leaves my skin silky-smooth.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because of the great price, but once it arrived it was the same exact product I had been buying at local Shiseido stores for a much higher price. I will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> shipping was very quick!!!! love it.</li>
            <li> I love this face cream. At night I use more but I also put a light cover under my make-up during the day. I have been using it awhile now. I would recommend it to any one. Great for dry to normal skin.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I love it  it works so well for my skin in two weeks</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Quite pricey, but worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I am very picky with what I put on my face. When I tried this cream 20 yrs ago, I fell in love with it.  Other less expensive creams fell short and I kept coming back to Shiseido. This is the best cream ever and I will never change it.</li>
            <li> I am 48 but the oldest guess for my age has been 33 and these are young people :-)</li>
            <li> Gave this to my mom as a Christmas gift and she loves it. She&#x27;s been a long time Shiseido user and her skin looks better than mine! Best price on Amazon! :)</li>
            <li> works well .only one complaint, when it came, it has lots of air space in the jar. I start to buy from macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! My skin screams &#x27;thank you&#x27; every time I use it! I apply it to my face in the morning and at night time. My skin is glowing &amp; looks healthier just after one application! I only wish I discovered this years ago! I&#x27;m in my fifties and my skin looks younger every day! Well worth the money for the results you will be getting! You will feel &amp; look like a million bucks! I just had to get it after sampling it in a cosmetic store. I was wowed! I Decided to look on line for a more affordable price. It has a rich appealing smell in a beautiful container! Get ready to be wowed!!</li>
            <li> I am not sure what is the beef of the other reviewer with this product. I just bought it, and it is exactly what it is supposed to be. I have been using it for years, so I hope I should know. No loose bottom on the jar, either. (I have encountered a loose bottom before from another vendor - it can happen with this type of glass/plastic composite jar, but does not affect the quality of the cream inside). I would not hesitate to buy this product again from this vendor.</li>
