            <li>i bought this product for the inside of my closet since it doesn&#x27;t have a light built into it.</li>
            <li>The hair feels soft and good.</li>
            <li>The round-shaped lights project a bright white beam of light and will outperform incandescent tap lights for longevity and brightness.</li>
            <li>its more intense in the light</li>
            <li>its gorgeous especially for the price just wish I could get</li>
            <li>Durably housed in ABS plastic with a cool, contemporary silhouette, each light nicely accommodates surrounding decor, traditional and modern alike.</li>
            <li>Easy to Install For fast, easy installation, simply use the supplied adhesive tape to mount the lights onto almost any surface--no wiring or plugs required.</li>
            <li>but I didnt need it to be that light the hair was still super soft after bleaching no shredding at all until I actually cut the tracks</li>
            <li>Each light comes equipped with energy-efficient LEDs that will last for up to 100 hours on three AAA batteries (sold separately).</li>
            <li>workes really well</li>
            <li>My hair came sooner than I expected, I ordered 2  bundles and they are very full.</li>
            <li>the hair holds a curls amazingly and can handle 430 degrees and the hair is a natural brown I managed to bleach it to a intense auburn with a few blonde highlights if I was to bleach it again</li>
            <li>and it was amazingly soft felt like butter</li>
            <li>Easily illuminate countertops, closets, pantries, storage shelves, stairways, and other everyday spaces with this three-pack of Fulcrum 30010 battery-operated tap lights.</li>
