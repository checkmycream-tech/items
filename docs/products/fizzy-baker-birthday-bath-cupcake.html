            <li> and I have to tell you that the other reviews are right when they say that the picture doesn&#x27;t do it justice.</li>
            <li> First I want to say shipping was slightly longer than expected</li>
            <li> It is very expensive for soap, had a pleasant but odd smell.  </li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re looking for a long time use from this bar of soap, this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> It was a book of coupons to a single mother.</li>
            <li> I emailed them (eBubbles) and in less than an hour, they email me back with a message that a replacement would be sent out today.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a little birthday present for my Daughter</li>
            <li> She liked it for her bath too, also we ordered the lip balms too, but I was really disappointed in their small size (no bigger than your thumb nail).</li>
            <li> the soap can only be used a few times and it falls apart.</li>
            <li> Now their little girls are asking,\\&quot;Will</li>
            <li> However, the scent of the bath bomb part was very weak, barely there.</li>
            <li> Both arrived with the center candle broken at the base and laying flat on the cupcakes.  </li>
            <li> The downside is that the protective wrapping on the inside of the box was BROKEN</li>
            <li> Poor follow through.</li>
            <li> Poor packaging.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>

            <li> This is super cute and was perfect for my 4 year olds recent birthday.  She had such a great time celebrating in the tub.  It was the perfect way to end her special day and to turn an ordinary bath into extrodinary fun.  She made a wish for one for her little sister&#x27;s birthday -- too cute!</li>
            <li> The Fizzy Baker Birthday Bath Cupcake is such a cute and unique way to wish someone you care about Happy Birthday without breaking the bank. Perfect idea for teen birthday, office birthday, etc. Flowers are so cliche....this would put a smile on anyone&#x27;s face!</li>
            <li> Receive the package on time.  Great customer service. I will purchase this item again.  it is a great gift for the bday.</li>
            <li> I got one of these for my wife&#x27;s birthday, it was extremely unique and well received.  It is very expensive for soap, had a pleasant but odd smell.  Worked well but definitely overpriced.  If used for a unique gift it works out well, but not something you would buy on a regular basis for personal use.</li>
            <li> This is a really cute idea.  I bought is as a gift for a woman who loves her nightly bath.&lt;br /&gt;It was larger than I thought it was going to be.</li>
            <li> Very nice goed looking cup cake with real candle. Nice surprise for someone on a diet ;-)</li>
            <li> I ordered this cupcake for my daughter&#x27;s birthday party as she wanted a chocolate party, this was a perfectly \\&quot;sweet\\&quot; item to adorn her table. It is true to life size and was adorable. She liked it for her bath too, also we ordered the lip balms too, but I was really disappointed in their small size (no bigger than your thumb nail). Keep in mind that this cupcake is actually a one time use only. Once it hits the tub of water it fizzes until it&#x27;s out of the \\&quot;fizz stuff\\&quot; and then you use what&#x27;s left as the soap. After that the fun is over, it&#x27;s just soap, and it melts quickly, so the soap can only be used a few times and it falls apart. So if you&#x27;re looking for a long time use from this bar of soap, this isn&#x27;t for you. Cute stuff, this was adorable for her party though!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a companion piece to a homemade present I made for a friend. It was a book of coupons to a single mother. One of the coupons was for an impromptu, child free bubble bath in a nice claw foot tub I happen to own. I wanted something special to have on stock for when she cashes in and this is PERFECT. I was a little apprehensive spending six dollars on it, but it turned out to be much larger than I had thought and I am pleased. It smells like jelly beans and is a perfect cupcake. I can&#x27;t wait for her to see it!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure that this would be so great once I saw it in person.  I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong. This cupcake is absolutely adorable and smells great too! A perfect birthday gift! I will be buying more for friends on their birthdays.</li>
            <li> These are just so cute!! And, they smell wonderful! It was neat how the icing turned into soap! Perfect little birthday gift.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my wonderful niece. She loved it and made her feel really special. It was a nice size, not too small or too large, and looks like an edible yummy cupcake.</li>
            <li> The item would have been exactly how it was describe online. The downside is that the protective wrapping on the inside of the box was BROKEN so the cupcake was rolling around on the inside of the box. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Nice little gift for the birthday girl.  She liked it and couldn&#x27;t wait to take a birthday bath.</li>
            <li> This is a very cute gift and I bought it a couple of months ago for two of my friends and they came perfect. This time around though the cupcake is crumbled and not in very good condition. A bit upset.</li>
            <li> What a great gift. I sent it to my sister for her birthday.</li>
            <li> I bought this for both my sister and myself for our birthdays, which are only a day apart.  We both loved this product.  It made the water incredibly soft and smelled so good.  I will buy again and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Very cute gift. The recipient was very excited and took it out of the box immediately. However, the scent of the bath bomb part was very weak, barely there. The soap had no scent at all. Cute idea. Poor follow through.</li>
            <li> First I want to say shipping was slightly longer than expected but I had an issue and they refunded the 1 problem and I have to say the product is awfully cute, and works well. This is WORTH EVERY PENNY! Thanks guys I will be back!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a little birthday present for my Daughter and I have to tell you that the other reviews are right when they say that the picture doesn&#x27;t do it justice. It is 10 times cuter!!! As for the company.... WONDERFUL!!! I had been worried about whether it would arrive on time and they did everything they could to make me feel accommodated and happy in knowing I was in good hands. I will definitely shop with them again in the future.</li>
            <li> Super cute birthday gift! The receiver can light the real candle and make a wish...blow it out and set it in her tub. The cake fizzes and leaves the soap icing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, their customer service is the best. I ordered 6 which I received promptly. One had a crack. I emailed them (eBubbles) and in less than an hour, they email me back with a message that a replacement would be sent out today. eBubbles is the BEST!</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more FIZZY BAKER BIRTHDAY BATH CUPCAKES.The ones I have given as gifts have been used and enjoyed.The busy Mom&#x27;s really appreciate these as gifts. Now their little girls are asking,\\&quot;Will you give me one for my BIRTHDAY?\\&quot; Of course,\\&quot; YES \\&quot;is my answer.Definitely a 5 star rating. The price is so reasonable too. Thanks for such a great gift idea!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Poor packaging.  I ordered 2 of them for gifts.  Both arrived with the center candle broken at the base and laying flat on the cupcakes.  Very cute, but broken, so I returned them.</li>
            <li> great gift and smells wonderful</li>
            <li> ...performed as designed and described. Really fun and relaxing, too.  Great gift for anyone special anytime!  Thank you, F Baker</li>
