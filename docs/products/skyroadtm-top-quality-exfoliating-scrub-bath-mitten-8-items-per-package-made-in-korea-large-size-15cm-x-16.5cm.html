            <li>Korean girlfriend introduced me to this product, which is feels kind of like a scouring pad for the skin.</li>
            <li>It would be nice</li>
            <li>These came really fast and are great!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re supposed to bring you smooth skin and all that good stuff.</li>
            <li>I was happy to read in one of the reviews about the material that use and how this was a great alternative (same material).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These are the greatest exfoliators around the entire world!  </li>
            <li>You probably don&#x27;t need this many Italy Towels.  </li>
            <li>They sure do exfoliate the heck out of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When you get out of the shower, you&#x27;ll feel a lot better and you&#x27;ll even be able to smell more ambient smells.  </li>
            <li>I love these</li>
            <li>but you have to put more pressure on it for it to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so smooth!</li>
            <li>Before I talk about how I like them, let me say my wife and two daughters love these things.  </li>
            <li>They talk about better skin, bumps going away, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>cannot believe how much better my skin feels after using these.  </li>
            <li>I love this product...wish I would have known about it years ago.</li>
            <li>I love these.  </li>
            <li>Everyone in the family has taken them from me :)</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use these now that I have a much more affordable option.</li>
            <li>My skin is lighter and more even.</li>
            <li>Over the summer, I had gotten many unwanted tan lines and they are practically gone from my arms and legs since using this product.</li>
            <li>I love them.  </li>
            <li>These do such a great job!</li>
            <li>A LOT BETTER</li>
            <li>Very friendly seller.</li>
            <li>In fact,  I was able to rub my skin with my finger tips and get the skin to roll off more easily that using these scratchy pads.</li>
            <li>(if they are available to you) and see if that works out better.</li>
            <li>Works brilliantly for deep exfoliation.  </li>
            <li>and they keep my skin smooth and healthy.  </li>
            <li>a must have for a smooth body polish Korean style.. :)</li>
            <li>It also seems to slowly help with my stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;About the shrinkage in water, I was easily able to stretch out and had no problem using it! :D</li>
            <li>but i love these little mits perfect size for over your hand and use on face.</li>
            <li>First discovered these at a Korean spa in LA.These are amazing.</li>
            <li>I am so happy to have finally found an easy source for these.  </li>
            <li>If you become overzealous, make sure you use a soothing oil like coconut to calm your skin.</li>
            <li>The towels are great for scrubbing you back, too.</li>
            <li>Fair enough, honey :)</li>
            <li>Smoootthhh skin is such a nice feeling!</li>
            <li>I have seen a significant difference in my skin in the time I have been exfoliating with these towels.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell if I&#x27;m clean.  </li>
            <li>and I feel clean.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.  </li>
            <li>Afterwards I rinsed, shaved my legs, and washed my hair in a cool shower--</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no cleaner showering than one that entails a full body exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>too many really in a  pack</li>
            <li>I could pay to get a full body exfoliation for that price.</li>
            <li>They just barely fit medium sized hands, they don&#x27;t fit large hands.  </li>
            <li>I love the feeling of smooth skin when the old skin has been peeled off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been complimented several times on how nice my skin is for a guy and how smooth it is.</li>
            <li>It really helps with my kids and smooth my skin out</li>
            <li>I scrubbed my arms and legs, neck, torso, and backside and wished I&#x27;d had someone handy to take care of my back.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure it would be as good as more expensive products</li>
            <li>I chose this rating because I honestly liked the product overall.</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>They are okay, but I don&#x27;t think they work any better than a washcloth or those little nylon gloves you can by from the dollar store.</li>
            <li>To top it off, the one on top of my pack (which are packaged in actual Ziploc brand baggies) had a drop of blood on it, so that was less than lovely.</li>
            <li>they fit over your fingers, not over your whole hand, so you really have to strain to keep them from falling off wile scrubbing.</li>
            <li>Just enough texture that when used lightly leaves my skin feeling smooth and not irritated.</li>
            <li>I tried it on my face, very gently, and it seem to improve my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In order for exfoliation, you have to be in water as hot as you can handle for about 15 minutes, or until your fingers begin to prune.  </li>
            <li>First time I took a 30 minute bath and the scrub didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li>and I tried again and this time with extra pressure and my skin started to exfoliate magically.</li>
            <li>It is something many asians use and is commonplace in public spas in asia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>showers, I soak under hot water for 3 minutes</li>
            <li>They work just as well as the Baiden, but they do have a funny smell.</li>
            <li>Where have these been my whole life?!?</li>
            <li>Mitten is great but too small!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t expect miracles, but right after, and the day after use, my skin is much softer and clearer.  </li>
            <li>No proper human can go without a good exfoliation.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have huge hands and they barely go up to my thumbs.</li>
            <li>Gentle circular scrubbing with your facial cleanser, a rinse with warm water and your skin just feels so soft.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much going on at first</li>
            <li>I used these in S. Korea and they are the real thing and not too much higher in price then buying them there.</li>
            <li>I didnt expect much for such a cheap price</li>
            <li>I really like these towels.</li>
            <li>, I gently rub it on my face, softer than ever.</li>
            <li>I even use it gently on my face.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Too abrasive for my taste and don&#x27;t like the way they shrink up so much after washing...want to thy Japonese Washi cloths</li>
            <li>I have real skin!!!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I estimate this package of 8 will get me through the whole year.</li>
            <li>Well, at one quarter the price, I got a whole pack of them.</li>
            <li>$13 is just too much for a run-of-the-mill scrub cloth.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much of these</li>
            <li>They really work wonders.</li>
            <li>They do work very well.</li>
            <li>Awesome product, I didn&#x27;t see skin rolling off, but then if I did, I think I&#x27;d be afraid.</li>
            <li>VERY plesed.</li>
            <li>but the heavens smiled at me and pointed to Amazon for the answer to getting rid of dead skin.</li>
            <li>If you like a nice big cloth, skip these and get bigger sizes.</li>
            <li>The size of these fit just fine for my small hands.</li>
            <li>For the full benefit of these cloths, I am jjust missing my old favorite jinjabong.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However I agree with other reviewers who said it shrinks so much that it becomes suitable for a child&#x27;s hand rather than an adult&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>These have worked great to remove literal layers of dry dead gray skin.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t live without them!</li>
            <li>, if you live nearby a Korean market, go buy them there; you can find these at the market being sold for much cheaper: $4.19 for a pack of 4.</li>
            <li>and it still takes some decent pressure.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>, my skin gets so soft and readily absorbs my lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll also add that I normally exfoliate weekly with a salt scrub and exfoliating gloves, but nevermore.</li>
            <li>Now&#x27;s realistically, I am a normal sized guy, 6&#x27; 5&#x27;11&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>this mitten I saw layers of dead skin falling off to reveal a new and healthy skin layer~&lt;br /&gt;After the exfoliation</li>
            <li>This does a far more thorough job and costs significantly less.</li>
            <li>I use black african soap, and between that and this thing my skin is loving me.</li>
            <li>I recommend scrubbing your face everyday, as it helps your skin remain clear and absorb skincare emollients THAT much better and faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves skin very soft.</li>
            <li>Tried several other kinds of exfoliating sponges and chemical exfoliants, but this does the job better.</li>
            <li>These cloths are flimsy, and shrank by a third after the first use.  </li>
            <li>You do have to apply a good deal of pressure when exfoliating and the key is to not wash off the debris when scrubbing as this allows for further removal of dead skin.  </li>
            <li>To get the full effect of the the towels, take a hot shower, i usually shampoo while I&#x27;m letting my skin soak in the water.</li>
            <li>and it remains more or less the same size.  </li>
            <li>The key to get optimal dead skin scrubbing off is to soak your skin in very warm to hot water for at least 5 minutes, that way your dead skin becomes turgid and easily and painlessly comes off during scrubbing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t super rough when I touched/felt it, but when I used it in the shower, oh boy, it scratched my skin!</li>
            <li>It made scrubbing a tiny bit inconvenient, but with a little stretching, I was able to do it more comfortably.</li>
            <li>Once your skin is prepared, some light pressure as you rub with the Italy Towel will begin to roll the dead skin off.  </li>
            <li>My skin soaked up lotion like it never has, and feels baby soft.  </li>
            <li>I use a separate cloth for my face, but please use it gently, otherwise it will cause scrapes on your facial skin.</li>
            <li>I am a early 40&#x27;s guy . . .</li>
            <li>As I lie in bed I find myself thinking &#x27;wow -</li>
            <li>how soft are my legs and feet&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my skin was.</li>
            <li>I also use these professionally &amp; send them home with clients.</li>
            <li>So naturally I googled it and read about the Baiden Mitten</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t work nearly as well as some of the reviewers say.  </li>
            <li>Use long firm strokes as other users have suggested for a great exfoliation prior to self tanning.</li>
            <li>, the vast majority of which were highly favourable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway I HIGHLY recommend everyone buy the smaller &amp;#34;mittens&amp;#34; (which are just square pockets) for the body, and this one to scrub your back.</li>
            <li>In this case, I should not have expected too much.</li>
            <li>I have done some research on these cloths and I was surprised that these were the same as those &amp;#34;Big Name Ones&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Then I came to one who rated it a little lower only because of the price, and talked about this product being available from Korea for far less money.  </li>
            <li>I will say i used this on my face and it seem less abrasive as the red glove and exfoliated very well!</li>
            <li>Firmly rub the towel on your skin after maybe 15 minutes in hot water, that&#x27;s all you need to do.</li>
            <li>Sloughed off a lot of dead skin on the first use.</li>
            <li>That was my catch phrase for a few days after I used one of these for the first time.</li>
            <li>I am pretty dissapointed, seems like I wasted my money.</li>
            <li>They are much smaller and they shrink when they dry, but once you get it wet again you can stretch them right back out.</li>
            <li>Useful only for a small child&#x27;s hands now.</li>
            <li>I used a green for full body and the pink for my face.</li>
            <li>They work just as well as similar, more expensive mittens and will last quite a long time before you have to use a new one.</li>

            <li> In fact,  I was able to rub my skin with my finger tips and get the skin to roll off more easily that using these scratchy pads.</li>
            <li> (if they are available to you) and see if that works out better.</li>
            <li> Works brilliantly for deep exfoliation.  </li>
            <li> and they keep my skin smooth and healthy.  </li>
            <li> a must have for a smooth body polish Korean style.. :)</li>
            <li> It also seems to slowly help with my stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;About the shrinkage in water, I was easily able to stretch out and had no problem using it! :D</li>
            <li> but i love these little mits perfect size for over your hand and use on face.</li>
            <li> First discovered these at a Korean spa in LA.These are amazing.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have finally found an easy source for these.  </li>
            <li> If you become overzealous, make sure you use a soothing oil like coconut to calm your skin.</li>
            <li> The towels are great for scrubbing you back, too.</li>
            <li> Fair enough, honey :)</li>
            <li> Smoootthhh skin is such a nice feeling!</li>
            <li> I have seen a significant difference in my skin in the time I have been exfoliating with these towels.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if I&#x27;m clean.  </li>
            <li> and I feel clean.</li>
            <li> Nothing special.  </li>
            <li> Afterwards I rinsed, shaved my legs, and washed my hair in a cool shower--</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no cleaner showering than one that entails a full body exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> too many really in a  pack</li>
            <li> I could pay to get a full body exfoliation for that price.</li>
            <li> They just barely fit medium sized hands, they don&#x27;t fit large hands.  </li>
            <li> I love the feeling of smooth skin when the old skin has been peeled off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been complimented several times on how nice my skin is for a guy and how smooth it is.</li>
            <li> It really helps with my kids and smooth my skin out</li>
            <li> I scrubbed my arms and legs, neck, torso, and backside and wished I&#x27;d had someone handy to take care of my back.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure it would be as good as more expensive products</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because I honestly liked the product overall.</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> They are okay, but I don&#x27;t think they work any better than a washcloth or those little nylon gloves you can by from the dollar store.</li>
            <li> To top it off, the one on top of my pack (which are packaged in actual Ziploc brand baggies) had a drop of blood on it, so that was less than lovely.</li>
            <li> they fit over your fingers, not over your whole hand, so you really have to strain to keep them from falling off wile scrubbing.</li>
            <li> Just enough texture that when used lightly leaves my skin feeling smooth and not irritated.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my face, very gently, and it seem to improve my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In order for exfoliation, you have to be in water as hot as you can handle for about 15 minutes, or until your fingers begin to prune.  </li>
            <li> First time I took a 30 minute bath and the scrub didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> and I tried again and this time with extra pressure and my skin started to exfoliate magically.</li>
            <li> It is something many asians use and is commonplace in public spas in asia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> showers, I soak under hot water for 3 minutes</li>
            <li> They work just as well as the Baiden, but they do have a funny smell.</li>
            <li> Where have these been my whole life?!?</li>
            <li> Mitten is great but too small!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t expect miracles, but right after, and the day after use, my skin is much softer and clearer.  </li>
            <li> No proper human can go without a good exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have huge hands and they barely go up to my thumbs.</li>
            <li> Gentle circular scrubbing with your facial cleanser, a rinse with warm water and your skin just feels so soft.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much going on at first</li>
            <li> I used these in S. Korea and they are the real thing and not too much higher in price then buying them there.</li>
            <li> I didnt expect much for such a cheap price</li>
            <li> I really like these towels.</li>
            <li> , I gently rub it on my face, softer than ever.</li>
            <li> I even use it gently on my face.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Too abrasive for my taste and don&#x27;t like the way they shrink up so much after washing...want to thy Japonese Washi cloths</li>
            <li> I have real skin!!!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I estimate this package of 8 will get me through the whole year.</li>
            <li> Well, at one quarter the price, I got a whole pack of them.</li>
            <li> $13 is just too much for a run-of-the-mill scrub cloth.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much of these</li>
            <li> They really work wonders.</li>
            <li> They do work very well.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, I didn&#x27;t see skin rolling off, but then if I did, I think I&#x27;d be afraid.</li>
            <li> VERY plesed.</li>
            <li> but the heavens smiled at me and pointed to Amazon for the answer to getting rid of dead skin.</li>
            <li> If you like a nice big cloth, skip these and get bigger sizes.</li>
            <li> The size of these fit just fine for my small hands.</li>
            <li> For the full benefit of these cloths, I am jjust missing my old favorite jinjabong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However I agree with other reviewers who said it shrinks so much that it becomes suitable for a child&#x27;s hand rather than an adult&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> These have worked great to remove literal layers of dry dead gray skin.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t live without them!</li>
            <li> , if you live nearby a Korean market, go buy them there; you can find these at the market being sold for much cheaper: $4.19 for a pack of 4.</li>
            <li> and it still takes some decent pressure.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> , my skin gets so soft and readily absorbs my lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll also add that I normally exfoliate weekly with a salt scrub and exfoliating gloves, but nevermore.</li>
            <li> Now&#x27;s realistically, I am a normal sized guy, 6&#x27; 5&#x27;11&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> this mitten I saw layers of dead skin falling off to reveal a new and healthy skin layer~&lt;br /&gt;After the exfoliation</li>
            <li> This does a far more thorough job and costs significantly less.</li>
            <li> I use black african soap, and between that and this thing my skin is loving me.</li>
            <li> I recommend scrubbing your face everyday, as it helps your skin remain clear and absorb skincare emollients THAT much better and faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves skin very soft.</li>
            <li> Tried several other kinds of exfoliating sponges and chemical exfoliants, but this does the job better.</li>
            <li> These cloths are flimsy, and shrank by a third after the first use.  </li>
            <li> You do have to apply a good deal of pressure when exfoliating and the key is to not wash off the debris when scrubbing as this allows for further removal of dead skin.  </li>
            <li> To get the full effect of the the towels, take a hot shower, i usually shampoo while I&#x27;m letting my skin soak in the water.</li>
            <li> and it remains more or less the same size.  </li>
            <li> The key to get optimal dead skin scrubbing off is to soak your skin in very warm to hot water for at least 5 minutes, that way your dead skin becomes turgid and easily and painlessly comes off during scrubbing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t super rough when I touched/felt it, but when I used it in the shower, oh boy, it scratched my skin!</li>
            <li> It made scrubbing a tiny bit inconvenient, but with a little stretching, I was able to do it more comfortably.</li>
            <li> Once your skin is prepared, some light pressure as you rub with the Italy Towel will begin to roll the dead skin off.  </li>
            <li> My skin soaked up lotion like it never has, and feels baby soft.  </li>
            <li> I use a separate cloth for my face, but please use it gently, otherwise it will cause scrapes on your facial skin.</li>
            <li> I am a early 40&#x27;s guy . . .</li>
            <li> As I lie in bed I find myself thinking &#x27;wow -</li>
            <li> how soft are my legs and feet&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my skin was.</li>
            <li> I also use these professionally &amp; send them home with clients.</li>
            <li> So naturally I googled it and read about the Baiden Mitten</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t work nearly as well as some of the reviewers say.  </li>
            <li> Use long firm strokes as other users have suggested for a great exfoliation prior to self tanning.</li>
            <li> , the vast majority of which were highly favourable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway I HIGHLY recommend everyone buy the smaller &amp;#34;mittens&amp;#34; (which are just square pockets) for the body, and this one to scrub your back.</li>
            <li> In this case, I should not have expected too much.</li>
            <li> I have done some research on these cloths and I was surprised that these were the same as those &amp;#34;Big Name Ones&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Then I came to one who rated it a little lower only because of the price, and talked about this product being available from Korea for far less money.  </li>
            <li> I will say i used this on my face and it seem less abrasive as the red glove and exfoliated very well!</li>
            <li> Firmly rub the towel on your skin after maybe 15 minutes in hot water, that&#x27;s all you need to do.</li>
            <li> Sloughed off a lot of dead skin on the first use.</li>
            <li> That was my catch phrase for a few days after I used one of these for the first time.</li>
            <li> I am pretty dissapointed, seems like I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> They are much smaller and they shrink when they dry, but once you get it wet again you can stretch them right back out.</li>
            <li> Useful only for a small child&#x27;s hands now.</li>
            <li> I used a green for full body and the pink for my face.</li>
            <li> They work just as well as similar, more expensive mittens and will last quite a long time before you have to use a new one.</li>
            <li> the little square does shrink up a little after drying, but it easily stretches out again when wet.</li>
            <li> These little pieces of cloth are the same type being used by professional Korean back scrubbers.  </li>
            <li> these little green scrubbers lift the top layer off releasing trapped hairs.</li>
            <li> These mitts barely make it to my thumb joint (average female size hands) and don&#x27;t exfoliate anymore than a regular terry cloth wash cloth.  </li>
            <li> And they seem to last a long time.</li>
            <li> To make any headway, you have to move the cloth in long back and forth strokes....</li>
            <li> pat dry, and hope that the next strip of skin gets exfoliated.</li>
            <li> While I enjoy using them on my face, body use is tedious and a lesson in futility.</li>
            <li> Takes a long time to come but then again theyre coming from Korea.</li>
            <li> The only thing I did not like was that the towels did seem to shrink when wet.</li>
            <li> Just wish they were larger because they do shrink when wet.</li>
            <li> use it for all of my body parts that is not sensitive.</li>
            <li> I love these little green cloths!!!!  </li>
            <li> I usually exfoliate with a sugar scrub that I pick up from the drug store, but my last tanning experience left me realizing that I wasn&#x27;t properly exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I bought these to try to deal with some chronically dry skin on my lower leg tattoos.  </li>
            <li> I just wring it out and hang it up to dry</li>
            <li> I have grown up with eczema and perpetual dry skin and ingrown hairs from shaving and</li>
            <li> You have to finish bathing, then pat dry your skin after wetting and ringing out the cloth.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of scars, they do not help with those, but by making the overall skin brighter, they are a little less apparent.  </li>
            <li> Wish it&#x27;s a little bigger...</li>
            <li> /&gt;FYI, they shrink like mad when first wet and larger hands will have issues for a short period.  </li>
            <li> They do shrink a little when wet, but they return to regular size.</li>
            <li> Only problem is when you&#x27;re scrubbing, it becomes a nuisance to stretch every few seconds.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so rough</li>
            <li> it damages the skin but just enough to slough off the dead cells.</li>
            <li> No amount of manipulating it while it is wet gets it to cover my hand.</li>
            <li> not much to say</li>
            <li> i expected</li>
            <li> Yes, they are smallish, and they do shrink a bit when wet.</li>
            <li> I saw absolutely no exfoliation.</li>
            <li> and I admit it does tell you how dirty was and clean your body</li>
            <li> They shrink when they&#x27;re wet, which is what helps your skin, so I just sewed two towels together and voil&amp;agrave;!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian and still too small for my hand.</li>
            <li> They do shrink a bit once they are wet, but are stretchy as well, so that was not a huge issue for me.  </li>
            <li> Less money?</li>
            <li> Does have a slight eraser smell so just wash with soap after you are done.</li>
            <li> Just remember the rub direction has to be perpendicular to the black lines on the cloth.</li>
            <li> Also, the use alone kills my arm for so little results.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any &#x27;shedding&#x27; - the rolling off of the dead skin that is characteristic for Baiden Mitten (at least what I saw in YouTube videos).</li>
            <li> I have pretty small hands, yet these are still seriously awkward.</li>
            <li> I could see the dead skin peeling off my legs.  </li>
            <li> She says there&#x27;s a satisfaction in seeing the dead skin is scoured off your body into rolleds she calls &amp;#34;noodles&amp;#34; .  </li>
            <li> But when I got to my arms there was a ton of dead skin cells just falling off.</li>
            <li> Tons of dead skin I had to keep rinsing.</li>
            <li> By the time dead skin starts rolling off, the rest of your body has already air-dried.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it was too small to fit over hand, which makes it difficult to maintain continuity when exfoliating.</li>
            <li> At first Nothing was happening and I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> Even as a petite woman it was still too small for my hand.</li>
            <li> It is too small.</li>
            <li> They are just too small.</li>
            <li> I guess I don&#x27;t usually exfoliate my arms well?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had these mitts before and these are small to begin with and shrink to 1/2 their size.</li>
            <li> they are small.</li>
            <li> They are too small and hard to keep on your hand.  </li>
            <li> I have chicken skin on my arms, my skin doesn&#x27;t exfoliate properly on</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really small!</li>
            <li> was skeptical of the Baiden Mitten since they don&#x27;t disclose what the material really is other than that it is natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seriously, I would rather not have that as a focus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was a weak moment I regret.  </li>
            <li> It requires a firm pressure, but was not at all painful.  </li>
            <li> I was so skeptical when I bought this.</li>
            <li> but I tried one and that one is chilling in the shower.</li>
            <li> I was amazed and disgusted at the same time.</li>
            <li> IF IT WASN&#x27;T SO DIFFICULT TO KEEP ON MY HAND WHILE BATHING.</li>
            <li> After you&#x27;re done exfoliating, lower the water temperature to lukewarm or ice cold and use soap.  </li>
            <li> and my chicken skin is 85% gone</li>
            <li> Just in case you&#x27;re wondering, I have used this on my face, but it stinks.</li>
            <li> My scales are no where as bad as they use to be.</li>
            <li> I just found it slightly annoying to keep stretching it.</li>
            <li> I am shocked!</li>
            <li> It is very painful, as if you&#x27;re going to peel off your skin</li>
            <li> Terrible.  </li>

            <li> I love this mitten! It gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;With this mitten I saw layers of dead skin falling off to reveal a new and healthy skin layer~&lt;br /&gt;After the exfoliation, my skin gets so soft and readily absorbs my lotion. It also seems to slowly help with my stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;About the shrinkage in water, I was easily able to stretch out and had no problem using it! :D</li>
            <li> definitely scrubbed off my spray tan no problem</li>
            <li> No proper human can go without a good exfoliation. I thought I was gonna scratch myself to death but the heavens smiled at me and pointed to Amazon for the answer to getting rid of dead skin.</li>
            <li> These are the greatest exfoliators around the entire world!  Buy them in bulk, share them with friends, keep them with you at all times.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! It really helps with my kids and smooth my skin out</li>
            <li> You probably don&#x27;t need this many Italy Towels.  They just barely fit medium sized hands, they don&#x27;t fit large hands.  They sure do exfoliate the heck out of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People who have never used these before:  I&#x27;ve given these out to people who have told me that they didn&#x27;t do anything except scratch them up.  This is because the user had not prepared the skin prior to use.  In order for exfoliation, you have to be in water as hot as you can handle for about 15 minutes, or until your fingers begin to prune.  Do not use ANY soap during the soaking process.  Once your skin is prepared, some light pressure as you rub with the Italy Towel will begin to roll the dead skin off.  After you&#x27;re done exfoliating, lower the water temperature to lukewarm or ice cold and use soap.  When you get out of the shower, you&#x27;ll feel a lot better and you&#x27;ll even be able to smell more ambient smells.  Do this once a month or every couple of weeks, you&#x27;ll always feel good.</li>
            <li> Works great but these are pretty small.</li>
            <li> Ive been using the red glove for a while so maybe im just used to that. I will say i used this on my face and it seem less abrasive as the red glove and exfoliated very well! So id recommend these for your face and maybe the red glove for body. Takes a long time to come but then again theyre coming from Korea.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t fit my hand.not happy at all</li>
            <li> When I got this I was so ecstatic to use this. I have chicken skin on my arms, my skin doesn&#x27;t exfoliate properly on it&#x27;s own so I used these. They&#x27;re really small! They shrink when they&#x27;re wet, which is what helps your skin, so I just sewed two towels together and voil&amp;agrave;! I really like these towels.To get the full effect of the the towels, take a hot shower, i usually shampoo while I&#x27;m letting my skin soak in the water. Don&#x27;t use soap! Firmly rub the towel on your skin after maybe 15 minutes in hot water, that&#x27;s all you need to do. I&#x27;ve used this towel twice since I got it and my chicken skin is 85% gone and my skin is softer than ever. Oh! Just in case you&#x27;re wondering, I have used this on my face, but it stinks. I don&#x27;t use pressure when i use this on my face, I gently rub it on my face, softer than ever. I love these and I couldn&#x27;t live without them!</li>
            <li> I was so skeptical when I bought this. First time I took a 30 minute bath and the scrub didn&#x27;t work at all. However after I took a shower and I tried again and this time with extra pressure and my skin started to exfoliate magically. It is very painful, as if you&#x27;re going to peel off your skin but you have to put more pressure on it for it to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However I agree with other reviewers who said it shrinks so much that it becomes suitable for a child&#x27;s hand rather than an adult&#x27;s. Even as a petite woman it was still too small for my hand. But the material is stretchable. Only problem is when you&#x27;re scrubbing, it becomes a nuisance to stretch every few seconds. I would suggest getting the mitten with the thumb finger (if they are available to you) and see if that works out better.</li>
            <li> I love these little green cloths!!!!  They exfoliate like nobodies business!  When I did my legs with it I could see the dead skin peeling off my legs.  I even use it gently on my face.  Makes my skin feel so smooth!</li>
            <li> Leaves skin very soft. Use long firm strokes as other users have suggested for a great exfoliation prior to self tanning. the little square does shrink up a little after drying, but it easily stretches out again when wet.</li>
            <li> A week or so ago, I read a glowing review for the Baiden Mitten. I will admit to being intrigued, despite the steep price  I went onto Amazon and read review for it, the vast majority of which were highly favourable. Then I came to one who rated it a little lower only because of the price, and talked about this product being available from Korea for far less money.  Comparable results? Less money? I&#x27;m in!  The package arrived yesterday, so this evening I put it to the test.  Soaked in the tub, no bubbles or salts or anything, for 15 minutes. Got out and began scrubbing with the mitten. It requires a firm pressure, but was not at all painful.  And it was simultaneously fascinating and revolting to see the skin coming off. I scrubbed my arms and legs, neck, torso, and backside and wished I&#x27;d had someone handy to take care of my back.  Afterwards I rinsed, shaved my legs, and washed my hair in a cool shower--warm water stung after the exfoliation.  My skin soaked up lotion like it never has, and feels baby soft.  I can&#x27;t recommend this highly enough! Note that the mitten shrinks as it&#x27;s damp, while you&#x27;re exfoliating, but you can stretch it back out. I&#x27;ll also add that I normally exfoliate weekly with a salt scrub and exfoliating gloves, but nevermore. This does a far more thorough job and costs significantly less.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no cleaner showering than one that entails a full body exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Korean girlfriend introduced me to this product, which is feels kind of like a scouring pad for the skin. It&#x27;s not so rough it damages the skin but just enough to slough off the dead cells. It is something many asians use and is commonplace in public spas in asia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to use soap with this product however my wife uses it in the traditional way, which is without soap, after which she applies moisturizing lotion.  She says there&#x27;s a satisfaction in seeing the dead skin is scoured off your body into rolleds she calls &amp;#34;noodles&amp;#34; .  I tried it and I admit it does tell you how dirty was and clean your body is when you&#x27;re done.  I like to use it with soap because I&#x27;m just used my Zest smell, plus I don&#x27;t get the unsightly noodles.  She says I don&#x27;t do it that way I can&#x27;t tell if I&#x27;m clean.  Fair enough, honey :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I HIGHLY recommend everyone buy the smaller &amp;#34;mittens&amp;#34; (which are just square pockets) for the body, and this one to scrub your back.</li>
            <li> Everything about it is perfect...except the size! It is too small. No amount of manipulating it while it is wet gets it to cover my hand. If you like a nice big cloth, skip these and get bigger sizes. They are just too small. Maybe for your kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s 8 items in the pack but I tried one and that one is chilling in the shower. The rest lies forgotten somewhere... :|</li>
            <li> Excellent exfoliators. They have replaced washcloths in my bath.  Keep extra on hand to give away.  and that is about all .</li>
            <li> This really take off all the dead skin. Smoootthhh skin is such a nice feeling! Wasn&#x27;t sure it would be as good as more expensive products but it truly trumps it!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it was too small to fit over hand, which makes it difficult to maintain continuity when exfoliating. The cloths do work. Over time it appears to lose some of its exfoliating power (perhaps the cloth wears out?). I use a separate cloth for my face, but please use it gently, otherwise it will cause scrapes on your facial skin. If you become overzealous, make sure you use a soothing oil like coconut to calm your skin. Refrain from using anything acidic or alcohol based.</li>
            <li> I am a early 40&#x27;s guy . . . not the manliest man, but also not metro.  I bought these to try to deal with some chronically dry skin on my lower leg tattoos.  At this price and with good reviews, why not.&lt;br /&gt;Well, you would think I was a hero.  Before I talk about how I like them, let me say my wife and two daughters love these things.  They talk about better skin, bumps going away, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot believe how much better my skin feels after using these.  I just use it instead of a wash cloth.  Does not feel overly abrasive, but feels like it was working.  But the results???  As I lie in bed I find myself thinking &#x27;wow - how soft are my legs and feet&#x27;.  Seriously, I would rather not have that as a focus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, they shrink like mad when first wet and larger hands will have issues for a short period.  But they stretch back out a bit.  And they seem to last a long time.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I love this product...wish I would have known about it years ago. Sloughed off a lot of dead skin on the first use. I will definitely get it again.</li>
            <li> Great product- love the way these make my skin feel! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard good things about these exfoliating cloth. They&#x27;re supposed to bring you smooth skin and all that good stuff. But to me, I dont think it works at all. It wasn&#x27;t super rough when I touched/felt it, but when I used it in the shower, oh boy, it scratched my skin! It hurts, let me tell you. And I don&#x27;t feel any difference on my skin either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and there is also no instructions on the package. Hmmm...</li>
            <li> I love these.  My Japanese mother always had these in the house.  Though the packaging states not to use them on your face, this is what my mother always used on her face.  She had beautiful skin.  Gentle circular scrubbing with your facial cleanser, a rinse with warm water and your skin just feels so soft.  I am so happy to have finally found an easy source for these.  Those with super-sensitive skin might want to only use these a couple times a week.  They exfoliate your skin so well, you&#x27;ll want to use another one for shower or bath.</li>
            <li> That was my catch phrase for a few days after I used one of these for the first time. I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my skin was. They work just as well as similar, more expensive mittens and will last quite a long time before you have to use a new one.</li>
            <li> Too abrasive for my taste and don&#x27;t like the way they shrink up so much after washing...want to thy Japonese Washi cloths Hope Amazon starts carrying them soon so I don&#x27;t have to order from japan or Europe.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and this helps with the scales and I feel clean. My scales are no where as bad as they use to be. I have real skin!!!!!&lt;br /&gt; I will order this again.</li>
            <li> These are amazing and I am stocking up on them. Everyone in the family has taken them from me :)</li>
            <li> not much to say&lt;br /&gt;as i expected&lt;br /&gt;were too many really in a  pack&lt;br /&gt;wish i could just buy one</li>
            <li> Love! When using for yourself, can wash &amp; reuse MULTIPLE times without it falling apart or losing their effect. I also use these professionally &amp; send them home with clients. They also love it!</li>
            <li> They work alright. It would be nice it they were just a bit bigger though. I don&#x27;t have huge hands and they barely go up to my thumbs.</li>
            <li> I have been wondering how to exfoliate your skin to prep for spray tans. I&#x27;ve been getting spray tans for a couple of years now and they are hit or miss for me. I usually exfoliate with a sugar scrub that I pick up from the drug store, but my last tanning experience left me realizing that I wasn&#x27;t properly exfoliating. So naturally I googled it and read about the Baiden Mitten and it&#x27;s miracle work. But I was turned off by the price tag: [[ASIN:B003TNQG4E Exfoliator Microdermabrasion Tool Treatment Exfoliating]] and thought that it was overpriced for a mitten. I could pay to get a full body exfoliation for that price. I was happy to read in one of the reviews about the material that use and how this was a great alternative (same material).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical of the Baiden Mitten since they don&#x27;t disclose what the material really is other than that it is natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, I bought these thinking I would try it out and maybe upgrade to the Baiden Mitten if these didn&#x27;t work out. They did. I just received them yesterday and already put them to the test. I used a green for full body and the pink for my face. I soaked and then I started to scrub. I didn&#x27;t notice much going on at first (I started out with my legs) But when I got to my arms there was a ton of dead skin cells just falling off. I guess I don&#x27;t usually exfoliate my arms well?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very pleased with this product and think I will be a lifer.</li>
            <li> Works brilliantly for deep exfoliation.  Tried several other kinds of exfoliating sponges and chemical exfoliants, but this does the job better. I haven&#x27;t had the same issues others report with shrinkage.  I just wring it out and hang it up to dry and it remains more or less the same size.  Also, just one of these will last for quite awhile.  I estimate this package of 8 will get me through the whole year.</li>
            <li> Having grown up using these &amp;#34;ttae soogun&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Italy towels&amp;#34;, as they&#x27;re called in Korea, these have been a staple in my bath and shower routine since my baby days. The key to get optimal dead skin scrubbing off is to soak your skin in very warm to hot water for at least 5 minutes, that way your dead skin becomes turgid and easily and painlessly comes off during scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For showers, I soak under hot water for 3 minutes then I exfoliate. I recommend scrubbing your face everyday, as it helps your skin remain clear and absorb skincare emollients THAT much better and faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, if you live nearby a Korean market, go buy them there; you can find these at the market being sold for much cheaper: $4.19 for a pack of 4. So you can get 8 of these for under $10 including tax.</li>
            <li> I have the Baiden mitten and I love it. It was getting time to purchase another one and I saw a review sugessting giving these a try. Well, at one quarter the price, I got a whole pack of them. They are much smaller and they shrink when they dry, but once you get it wet again you can stretch them right back out. They work just as well as the Baiden, but they do have a funny smell. Oh, well. I will continue to use these now that I have a much more affordable option.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because I honestly liked the product overall. I have seen a significant difference in my skin in the time I have been exfoliating with these towels. My skin is lighter and more even. Over the summer, I had gotten many unwanted tan lines and they are practically gone from my arms and legs since using this product. The only thing I did not like was that the towels did seem to shrink when wet. It made scrubbing a tiny bit inconvenient, but with a little stretching, I was able to do it more comfortably.</li>
            <li> I like them, work well</li>
            <li> Just got those and tried one last night. I didn&#x27;t notice any &#x27;shedding&#x27; - the rolling off of the dead skin that is characteristic for Baiden Mitten (at least what I saw in YouTube videos). I am pretty dissapointed, seems like I wasted my money. $13 is just too much for a run-of-the-mill scrub cloth.</li>
            <li> I used these in S. Korea and they are the real thing and not too much higher in price then buying them there. For the full benefit of these cloths, I am jjust missing my old favorite jinjabong.</li>
            <li> I am shocked! I was amazed and disgusted at the same time. Tons of dead skin I had to keep rinsing. And yes, I even showered with my loofah before using it. I didn&#x27;t expect much of these but figured I&#x27;d try one because of the price compared to the Baiden mitten. They did shrink a bit even though my hand isn&#x27;t that big I just found it slightly annoying to keep stretching it.Shipped in 10 days. Does have a slight eraser smell so just wash with soap after you are done. I took pictures. I will definitely buy these again.</li>
            <li> I love them.  They really work wonders.</li>
            <li> These little pieces of cloth are the same type being used by professional Korean back scrubbers.  It is amazing how effective they are for exfoliation.  I use them once every week and they keep my skin smooth and healthy.  Just remember the rub direction has to be perpendicular to the black lines on the cloth.</li>
            <li> These have worked great to remove literal layers of dry dead gray skin. I am on use 5 now and am still getting palmfuls of skin &amp;#34;noodles&amp;#34;. I have grown up with eczema and perpetual dry skin and ingrown hairs from shaving and these little green scrubbers lift the top layer off releasing trapped hairs.</li>
            <li> Mitten is great but too small! I&#x27;m Asian and still too small for my hand. Wish it&#x27;s a little bigger...</li>
            <li> Terrible.  I have had these mitts before and these are small to begin with and shrink to 1/2 their size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these once a week and they do seem to help.  I wouldn&#x27;t expect miracles, but right after, and the day after use, my skin is much softer and clearer.  I have a lot of scars, they do not help with those, but by making the overall skin brighter, they are a little less apparent.  The size of these fit just fine for my small hands.</li>
            <li> These do such a great job!</li>
            <li> Nothing special.  Same as the scrubbing cloths I use from the asian store.</li>
            <li> Shame on me for following a blog&#x27;s advice and buying these.  It was a weak moment I regret.  These mitts barely make it to my thumb joint (average female size hands) and don&#x27;t exfoliate anymore than a regular terry cloth wash cloth.  To top it off, the one on top of my pack (which are packaged in actual Ziploc brand baggies) had a drop of blood on it, so that was less than lovely.</li>
            <li> It shrinks, but it works well.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. In this case, I should not have expected too much.Being somewhat flimsy, and I must agree with others....they are small. I have to position my hand perpendicular (/) with my middle finger up in a stitched corner. I have pretty small hands, yet these are still seriously awkward. While I enjoy using them on my face, body use is tedious and a lesson in futility. You have to finish bathing, then pat dry your skin after wetting and ringing out the cloth. To make any headway, you have to move the cloth in long back and forth strokes....and it still takes some decent pressure. By the time dead skin starts rolling off, the rest of your body has already air-dried. Thus, the futility. I don&#x27;t have time to get in and out of water, pat dry, and hope that the next strip of skin gets exfoliated. Also, the use alone kills my arm for so little results. I will use them on my face, and buy a Baiden or another for body use.</li>
            <li> They do work very well. Just wish they were larger because they do shrink when wet. You just have to work with it.</li>
            <li> It exfoliates and seem to prevent breakouts. I love the feeling of smooth skin when the old skin has been peeled off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it for all of my body parts that is not sensitive. I tried it on my face, very gently, and it seem to improve my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not use it to rub the same spot for 100 times, though, that would only give you a rash...</li>
            <li> First discovered these at a Korean spa in LA.These are amazing. Everyone in my family loves them. The towels are great for scrubbing you back, too.</li>
            <li> they fit over your fingers, not over your whole hand, so you really have to strain to keep them from falling off wile scrubbing.</li>
            <li> THIS SKYROAD WOULD WORK A LOT BETTER IF IT WASN&#x27;T SO DIFFICULT TO KEEP ON MY HAND WHILE BATHING.</li>
            <li> Yes, they are smallish, and they do shrink a bit when wet. Now&#x27;s realistically, I am a normal sized guy, 6&#x27; 5&#x27;11&amp;#34; 180 and i have no problem using these. Of course, how I do it might be the trick. They are the perfect size for putting the bar of soap into and using it to scrub yourself that way! I use black african soap, and between that and this thing my skin is loving me. I use it once or twice a week and I scrub the living heck out of myself with it, face and all. I&#x27;ve been complimented several times on how nice my skin is for a guy and how smooth it is. Hehe. No complaints there! Awesome product, I didn&#x27;t see skin rolling off, but then if I did, I think I&#x27;d be afraid. LOL</li>
            <li> These cloths are flimsy, and shrank by a third after the first use.  Useful only for a small child&#x27;s hands now.</li>
            <li> I just received these yesterday and I couldn&#x27;t wait to try them out. I soaked in the tub for about 15 minutes and started scrubbing my arms and shoulders. At first Nothing was happening and I was a little disappointed. I started on my torso and I started seeing my skin just peel off!! I was grossed out and amazed at the same time. My skin has never felt so soft and smooth! My friend stopped by and I gave her one to try, she called after she used it and She&#x27;s in Love with it too! Where have these been my whole life?!? Definitely stocking up on them!!!</li>
            <li> I saw absolutely no exfoliation. I&#x27;ve tried it several times. I definitely would not recommend this product. Save for the reall thing.</li>
            <li> They are too small and hard to keep on your hand.  They don&#x27;t work nearly as well as some of the reviewers say.  In fact,  I was able to rub my skin with my finger tips and get the skin to roll off more easily that using these scratchy pads. They are okay, but I don&#x27;t think they work any better than a washcloth or those little nylon gloves you can by from the dollar store.</li>
            <li> VERY plesed. I didnt expect much for such a cheap price but i love these little mits perfect size for over your hand and use on face. Makes my 40&#x27;s skin feel like a teenagers!</li>
            <li> I am in love with these!!! I have done some research on these cloths and I was surprised that these were the same as those &amp;#34;Big Name Ones&amp;#34;. They do shrink a little when wet, but they return to regular size. The exfoliating was just heaven. You can feel a big difference in your skin as you use it. I have one for my face another for my shower also packed one for my business trips. Worth every penny!!! Great Product</li>
            <li> These came really fast and are great! Very friendly seller. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Excellent for the skin</li>
            <li> These are great for a rigorous, Korean-like exfoliation.  They do shrink a bit once they are wet, but are stretchy as well, so that was not a huge issue for me.  I found the best way to use them was towards the end of my shower/bath as the skin is more supple and easier to exfoliate.  You do have to apply a good deal of pressure when exfoliating and the key is to not wash off the debris when scrubbing as this allows for further removal of dead skin.  Each scrub lasts for a while, I change them every 2 months or so and I have never had any issues with mold.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  Just enough texture that when used lightly leaves my skin feeling smooth and not irritated. I bought a number of them for a great price for my teenagers with acne.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Great exfoliate  a must have for a smooth body polish Korean style.. :)</li>
