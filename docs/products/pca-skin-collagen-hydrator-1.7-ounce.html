            <li>One plastic surgeon recommend me this collagen hydrator, I was skeptic at first, thinking that he just want to sell me something, but I am so pleased with this product.</li>

            <li>Once you warm it up on your fingers it is easier to apply and my skin completely absorbs it.</li>

            <li>face feels smooth and soft without being greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that it leaves no stickiness when it dries, however this cream alone will still makes me skin feeling a bit dry</li>

            <li>(as in i still feel my skin tug when i smile which i don&#x27;t like, this is a personal preference that has nothing to do with the product).</li>
            <li>I really like this and the price was a lot better than at the doctors office where I usually buy it.  </li>
            <li>and I think it looks creamy and the fine lines around my eyes and lips have become less visible.</li>
            <li>It has been maintaining my clear skin which i appreciate.</li>
            <li>SOOTHING ON SENSITIVE SKIN.</li>
            <li>My skin is 61 years old</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it has any &amp;#34;lasting effects&amp;#34; which make it better than other moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried, but I do like how it feels.</li>

            <li> light moisturizer recommended by a plastic surgeon..use a night cream..not greasy and leaves skin fresh and not oily as so many night creams do..</li>
            <li> a great cream! I love that it leaves no stickiness when it dries, however this cream alone will still makes me skin feeling a bit dry (as in i still feel my skin tug when i smile which i don&#x27;t like, this is a personal preference that has nothing to do with the product). Currently I&#x27;ve been applying an extra layer of a different moisturizer with this PCA hydrator every night as my nightly routine, just until the PCA serum I just ordered arrives. My skin feels great after application and even better in the morning. It has been maintaining my clear skin which i appreciate. Will order again when I run out.</li>
            <li> my skin feels moist and tighter at the same time! love it!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Love it for mature skin.</li>
            <li> for my mom and she luvs it</li>
            <li> One plastic surgeon recommend me this collagen hydrator, I was skeptic at first, thinking that he just want to sell me something, but I am so pleased with this product. I&#x27;m using it more then year!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer and use it as a night cream</li>
            <li> Have tried several other products and they irritate my skin, so back to PCA Products.  I will never stray again</li>
            <li> PCA products are fabulous.  I love the way my skin feels- it&#x27;s a great moisturizer for winter.  I was happy with the seller too.</li>
            <li> Keeps skin moist all day</li>
            <li> Purchased this because it&#x27;s what my esthetician used on me and I love it.  Use it to rehydrate my skin at night time.</li>
            <li> MOISTURIZING BUT NOT GREASY. SOOTHING ON SENSITIVE SKIN.</li>
            <li> I ordered this one because I used this lotion before.  Bought it from my cosmetologist for almost twice as much before.  Then I realized I could find it on Amazon.  And I did.  They/ Amazon/  are amazing:  one can find everything there, just name it!</li>
            <li> I really like this and the price was a lot better than at the doctors office where I usually buy it.  Received it right away.</li>
            <li> The cream is a bit intimidating with the thick consistency. Once you warm it up on your fingers it is easier to apply and my skin completely absorbs it. It is a non greasy formula and very pleasant once it sets. Give it about 10 min before makeup application. I have combination skin with minor breakouts, have had no issue with it thus far. I noticed it has helped in the healing of breakouts and dry skin. Great product. Great price. I will repurchase. Other high end creams I have used: la mer and elemis, I would still pick PCA over them.</li>
            <li> My nighttime moisturizer. Love it. I&#x27;m 62.</li>
            <li> My esthetician uses this on my face, so I purchased some of my own. Love the feel of it, and it seems to hydrate well. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it has any &amp;#34;lasting effects&amp;#34; which make it better than other moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried, but I do like how it feels.</li>
            <li> I guess there was some hydration, but I will not be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a month, morning and night, and see no difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It goes on smoothly, is light, and perfect under make up.  A daily &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; for a beautiful complexion.</li>
            <li> It worked for a while but the pharmaceutical ingredients left my skin addicted to it and moisture starved, evidenced by the cracking and peeling. Also caused breakouts because my skin couldn&#x27;t breath and was irritated and dry. My skin is much happier with Even Healy.</li>
            <li> This was just OK but for the money I would buy another product that is organic. I would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and sealed as new!</li>
            <li> I had a facial not long ago along and this was the product line they used.  Had a mild chemical peel, used this and the Balm.  Just love it.  The Balm, does exactly that...soothes your face while hydrating.  The Hydrator is a slightly more in depth moisturizing product.  But so far, haven&#x27;t found any product they make that I don&#x27;l like, and the prices on Amazon are very nice!  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Keeps face hydrated all day! Love it!</li>

I use the entire PCA skin line as far as cleanser, toner, serums total strength, peptide and eye cream.! Love the product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve tried and has really improved my skin. I wouldn&#x27;t go without it.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described!  Great product!</li>
            <li> This is a really rich hydrator that soaks into your skin and does not sit on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face feels smooth and soft without being greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend!</li>
