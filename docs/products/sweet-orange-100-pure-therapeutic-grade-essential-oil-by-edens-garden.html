            <li>I love the smell of oranges so was thrilled to get this</li>
            <li>Its by far the best smelling orange oil ive gotten.</li>
            <li>and I love it to make my own household cleaners.  </li>
            <li>This is absolutely amazing,  the quality is top notch.  </li>

            <li>OMG the smell is soo good :) going to use this for bath, lotions and as scent for room :) The delivery was fast and thanks for that also :)) best regards</li>
            <li>The scents are very nice at first but after about a week of having opened them they lose most of there power.  </li>
            <li>They smelled nice as I opened the bottle, so I guessed everything was fine.</li>
            <li>I think their potency is just as good as the higher priced oils!</li>
            <li>10 more words required....</li>

            <li>It smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love this scent.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more of a satsuma type scent</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s a bit like using a salt shaker and having the top come</li>
            <li>I have used oils extensively and these are superb.</li>
            <li>I LOVE all of the Oils I have purchased from Edens Garden,  </li>
            <li>also love the catalog they send with your purchases.....</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just 4 stars because this isn&#x27;t our favorite oil out of their selection.  </li>
            <li>Orange is my favorite-</li>
            <li>Love the verity of scents</li>
            <li>Lovely scent.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It was okay for the price I guess.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Already I am in love with it.  </li>
            <li>and everyone&#x27;s glad</li>
            <li>Love this oil.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>mmmmmm, love that smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about to order some citronella (for mosquito repellant), peppermint and lavender (for \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot;- my friend tried it and has me convinced it&#x27;s better than store bought shampoo).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably add more oils to the collection once I get more \\&quot;recipes\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>and it couldn&#x27;t smell any better.</li>
            <li>So because they were cheaper, I bought many of Eden&#x27;s Garden oils.</li>
            <li>but now I have to replace all of the Eden&#x27;s Garden oils with better ones.</li>
            <li>Great prices and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I ordered two oils from the company and realized that there was an issue when they arrived (which was probably USPS more than them)</li>
            <li>Price is much better than most stores.</li>
            <li>I am pleased all the way around :) I have been using these in soaps, bath salts, homemade cleaning concoctions, laundry</li>
            <li>Love the smell of these one</li>
            <li>I need to order more.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>

            <li>This is one of my favorite fragrances...</li>
            <li>but you can get better oils</li>
            <li>pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;It smells more like the orange peel, but yet refined.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural, smells great and the price is nice.</li>
            <li>Have enjoyed it in a diffuser.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s the latest.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>

            <li>The smell is potent, and they sent both a usage guide and catalog explaining all the oils they have.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I used this to make Shea butter lotion, but it came with info of its many uses.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s lovely.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this.</li>

            <li>I just discovered it&#x27;s not my favorite scent, but if you like the smell of oranges, this is for you.</li>
            <li>I will eventually try many more of the scents.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more...</li>
            <li>not my favorite brand</li>

            <li>I use it mostly to scent my laundry detergent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was a bit put off by the Biblical references that came in a pamphlet about how to use the oil, and I&#x27;m not even sure it&#x27;s supposed to be used as perfume though I was searching for that when these came up.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this smell.</li>
            <li>I bought this Essential Oil to add to my exfoliating salt scrub and it smells wonderful.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased Eden&#x27;s Garden&#x27;s oils before and have always been satisfied with the fine balance of quality and price.  </li>
            <li>Seems pure as stated, hasn&#x27;t lost it&#x27;s scent over time, consistency is liquid good and not thick.&lt;br /&gt;Mix</li>
            <li>also use a couple of drops of this oil in a bottle filled with water and vinegar which I use to clean counters with and it leaves a nice smell as compared to the vinegar</li>
            <li>This company offers quality oils for a great price.</li>
            <li>Plus, I suggest anyone try washing your sheets with a touch of lavender, a great natural sleep aid).</li>
            <li>I make this about 10% of my grapeseed-lavender-tea-tree blend and it makes everything blend in smoothly and silkily instead of sitting on top of my skin and looking shiny.  </li>
            <li>and it always gives my hair a lovely light</li>

            <li>(it is Sweet Orange after all!).  </li>
            <li>We sometimes add Sweet Orange to a carrier oil to use when massaging the horses or ourselves!  </li>
            <li>It is too easy to accidentally overdo it, and then you can&#x27;t remove the excess flavor</li>
            <li>I have never used essential oils before, but was able to get them and a great price.</li>
            <li>I use the peppermint oil and breathe easy oils when I&#x27;m congested</li>
            <li>The aroma is incredible the cent is true to the sweet orange, very rejuvenated , it&#x27;s a fresh wake up oil, love it</li>
            <li>and I love my house smelling like it after I clean instead of smelling like my vinegar cleaner.</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t as strong as I thought it would be</li>
            <li>Strongly suggest it for use in a diffuser.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t quite as strong as I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>This is a nice scent, yes it&#x27;s sweet orange but not too sweet.</li>
            <li>, it isn&#x27;t quite as strong of a citrus scent as you might except</li>
            <li>We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>Love the sweet orange.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more at full price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One of my favorite uses of it is in a toner water made with lemon, sweet orange, and tea tree oils.</li>
            <li>So far, i am loving the smell!</li>
            <li>I love this sweet orange oil.  </li>
            <li>I love the Sweet Orange oil.</li>
            <li>At first I put excellent ratings, it was my first time purchasing essential oils and to be honest</li>
            <li>I love love love this oil, it&#x27;s my favorite by far.</li>
            <li>very nice, edens garden sells good quality essential oils at a reasonable price</li>
            <li>The Sweet Orange has more of a light, airy scent to it while the Blood Orange had a deeper scent.</li>
            <li>I combine some of these based on his symptoms and run it in my diffusor and he is fine all night.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure, and quickly too.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super speedy too!</li>
            <li>I just got this in the mail today, and it shipped rather quickly!</li>
            <li>Delivered Quickly!</li>
            <li>I love putting it in a pot of boiling water to make my home smell like one nice sweet orange that just got peeled and is ready to be eaten.  </li>
            <li>The smell is nice and my place smells like sweet oranges right now.</li>
            <li>Super amazing, will certainly be ordering more from them.</li>
            <li>I will also drop orange with lemon (about 6 drops of each into each lamp), everyone who comes over when I do this always asks how I make my home smell so clean, and it is a fresh smell and not the soap aisle clean kind of smell.</li>
            <li>i used it 2 days now and is my favorite smell is not strong or too sweet... is so fragrant my room smelled wonderfully</li>
            <li>love the scent its strong and last a good while.</li>
            <li>HIGH QUALITY AND QUICK DELIVERY!!!</li>
            <li>I made some orange peppermint toothpaste from coconut oil and baking soda and the taste of these oils is very refreshing and high quality.</li>
            <li>This truly is the way oranges smell and the aroma is invigorating and light.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a quality product that would impart a light scent to my towels.</li>
            <li>Customer service is nice and replies very timely.</li>
            <li>They really have a nice smell.</li>
            <li>Great smelling essential oil!</li>
            <li>Great product just not enough</li>
            <li>so many useful ways to use this.</li>
            <li>Made me want fresh squeezed OJ :)</li>
            <li>Mixe a few drops of this with bio oil is wonderful..</li>
            <li>This is a great essential oil.</li>
            <li>Eventually, I want to purchase an essential oil diffuser and diffuse this happy scent throughout my room.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>OMG, the smell is fantastic..  </li>
            <li>I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM.</li>
            <li>We also enjoy adding it to our humidifier in winter as it adds a soothing aroma to the air.  </li>
            <li>They are cheap.</li>
            <li>This oil is great to add to your regular hair oil for stimulating your scalp.</li>
            <li>This is a great company selling quality oils at low prices.</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll love this product, you can put a two or three drops in your bath and it smells a whole bathroom like oranges I love that</li>
            <li>I went right to the company and purchased more and shipping was free because I bought quite a lot.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as strong as I was hoping for, I am sure just a regular orange one would be, but it is nice and sweet smelling!</li>
            <li>Next to lavender, it is my absolute FAVORITE!!!</li>
            <li>From all of them, sweet orange is the nicest, not too strong and</li>
            <li>The orange is sweet and strong.</li>
            <li>My whole family loves this oil!!!</li>
            <li>Very nice essential oil</li>
            <li>Love the fresh clean orange scent.  </li>
            <li>But, loving the lemon and orange in particular, my wife made a request for cinnamon (for the kitchen primarily) and gardenia.</li>
            <li>More power to them for taking the same exact product and charging an arm and a leg for them lol.</li>
            <li>smell like oranges but not like super strong</li>
            <li>My new favorite!</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite!</li>
            <li>I love using this oil, in my oil burner just dilute it with a little water, the house smells fresh, clean, and a wonderful citrus scent, not to strong, and not to weak, just perfect, will continue to keep buying this oil..</li>
            <li>Fresh and clean!</li>
            <li>I still like this Sweet Orange though and use it as a hand moisturizer (love that I don&#x27;t need to wipe excess oil off; it seeps right into my skin without leaving me oily) and in my conditioner.</li>
            <li>I originally bought it thinking it was</li>
            <li>I love love love this brand of essential oils.</li>
            <li>Excited to see all the ways i can use it...</li>
            <li>I love it so much!</li>
            <li>Just clean, citrusy, orangeness.</li>
            <li>Use it to make the house smell clean.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, people have not tried better products if they give such amazing reviews to this item.</li>
            <li>Our horses love the fragrance of Sweet Orange, so we let them inhale the aroma straight from the bottle!  </li>
            <li>I especially love mixing it with other oils as the orange smell is not overpowering but blends very well.</li>
            <li>I prefer to pay more and get a pure oil than this quality ever again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;HIGHLY recommended for someone special, i.e., someone whose tastes you know.</li>
            <li>They seem to utilize excellent extraction procedures as well as quality control in the manufacture of their products.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend to anyone interested in essential oils.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet smelling, but not a sick sweet.</li>
            <li>It smelled citrusy like oranges, and sweet like chemicals.</li>
            <li>The Sweet Orange smells just like an orange.  </li>
            <li>The company puts a lot of love into their products and the bottles look absolutely</li>
            <li>Not as sweet smelling as I thought</li>
            <li>I thought they were good because I did not know how essential oils should be.</li>
            <li>I keep ordering these incenses as they last, and are a good quality incense.</li>

            <li>I mixed with a carrier oil to use after shower and it smells good.  </li>
            <li>Bought to use in homemade face oil for my oily, acne prone skin (sweet orange oil is an astringent).</li>
            <li>I was raised in a county full of oranges.</li>
            <li>Out of the three oils that I purchased (lemon, sweet orange, and melaleuca), this oil was my second-favorite.</li>
            <li>really like this, also has many uses.</li>
            <li>but thankfully that does not hold true for this oil.  </li>
            <li>I ordered Sweet Orange, Clove, Tea Tree and Bergamot oils.</li>

            <li>This smells just like fresh cut oranges.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if maybe I just got an old bottle or if sweet orange isn&#x27;t very potent in general.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of Sweet Orange Essential Oil (sold by Eden&#x27;s Garden).</li>
            <li>I love the smell of orange, and you can definitely tell this is sweet orange</li>
            <li>True essential orange oil has more of a purpose than for scentsty burners and food.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Simple, sweet, and pure.  </li>
            <li>I use it for so much, but my favorite use is to but a few drops on my wool dryer balls to make my laundry smell fabulous!!</li>
            <li>The scent is exactly like fresh orange peels.  </li>
            <li>It really smelled like I was peeling sweet oranges in the kitchen</li>
            <li>This essential oil smells absolutely amazing and can be used for so many different things!</li>
            <li>Really does smell like sweet orange peels &amp;#60;3 ...</li>
            <li>and they were so friendly and easy to communicate with, that I will buy essential oils from them from here on out for that reason if nothing else!</li>
            <li>I contacted the company, and a new bottle was immediately sent to replace, free if charges, including shipping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a happy scent; a definite mood lifter.</li>
            <li>It smells very nice, blended well with the mixture and was not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>I am a first time buyer of essential oils and kept reading how great they were for adding lasting scent to your home.</li>
            <li>Over all I am very very pleased with this product and will order again, and I will most likely try other EO&#x27;s from this company.</li>

            <li>My first time using this scent and can&#x27;t wait until I put it in my mixes.</li>
            <li>I will order more later.</li>
            <li>Was exactly as needed and described.</li>
            <li>It is safer to put the drops into a spoon first rather than trying to shake them out over the food.</li>
            <li>Potent and mysterious.  </li>
            <li>I am a massage therapist, and love to theme the scents in my room to the season (as much as possible), So this is one that I used for summer!  </li>
            <li>I Love mixing these different oils.</li>
            <li>Exactly want I wanted.</li>
            <li>but I definitely recommend it...and will be ordering more...</li>
            <li>AND IT IS REAL ORANGE OIL USEFUL</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t wait to buy more scents from the same brand &amp; seller.</li>
            <li>It works alright for that purpose, but it takes a lot of oil (10 drops or more) and the scent only lasts for about 30 minutes before it dries up.</li>
            <li>Smells like the real fruit!</li>
            <li>I love it and will purchase again in the future!</li>
            <li>Smells exactly like oranges.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more.</li>

            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to make my first \\&quot;batch\\&quot; of lotion.</li>

            <li>It is exactly as it was advertised.</li>

            <li>Top quality oils- made a room spray with water and hours later still can smell.</li>
            <li>I ordered several bottles of different oil and they included an awesome booklet with all their scents with description and a 101 uses for essential oils pamphlet...</li>
            <li>I put a few drops in my hot bath &amp; had room smelling good.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite essential oil, but it worked for the purpose I bought it for.</li>

            <li>A little goes a very long way, but it smells so delicious that you&#x27;ll use it for everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am excited to see what other oils I may mix this one with and come up with other creative scents on my own.</li>
            <li>The scent of the orange oil is very nice and delicate.  </li>
            <li>Nice scent to use in my lotion and other body products.</li>
            <li>Smell nice and a fracrion of the price of other citrus oils.</li>
            <li>I really love all the oils I have bought from Edens Garden so its hard to choose my favorite this one I like to use with my plug in diffuser</li>
            <li>Fairly priced, came much much quicker than expected, and smells DIVINE!!!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to everyone who wants to live a healthy lifestyle with all natural products.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s every bit as good as the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li>i choose this high rating, because this is a product i would reorder again.this product has the scent of fresh oranges.and</li>
            <li>(My significant other is highly allergic to tide and other fragrance laden soaps, so I was thrilled to find that I can wash our clothes with essential oils such as orange as an additive to give our clothes a great clean smell without breaking him out.</li>
            <li>I am not a dealer, do not know anyone associated with this company, do not work in this industry and am given nothing for giving positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Smells great by itself or mixed with other oil scents.</li>
            <li>I have ordered several different oils at different times they provide a very good fast service</li>
            <li>it works great for common coughs and colds!</li>
            <li>The product is just as described and in my opinion is very high quality.  </li>
            <li>even though this oil had less of that chemical type smell than aura caccia, there is nothing sweet about this aroma, it has a strong chemical type smell which could be inherent in the oil or not.</li>
            <li>I put about 20 drops on to my furnace filter and the whole house smelled fabulous, but only for about an hour or two.</li>
            <li>Price was doable; used it for my hair, my skin and the scent is very calming.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t pay 2-3 times as much for &amp;#34;designer&amp;#34;</li>

            <li>I would highly recommend any of their products!</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I had did the whole scentsy thing, ordering the blocks and whatnot to fragrance my home.</li>
            <li>They also made sure to wrap it carefully</li>
            <li>I plan to use it in the morning to help me wake up refreshed, ready to start the day.</li>
            <li>Smells NOTHING like orange blossoms... doesn&#x27;t really even smell like oranges.</li>
            <li>real orange.</li>
            <li>The two I bought from this company are really inadequate when it comes to aromatherapy, I believe.</li>
            <li>I would much prefer to spend 3/4 times the money and get the smells</li>
            <li>Fast shipping  </li>
            <li>Also the bottle lasted much longer</li>

            <li>I really like this eo</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just like real oranges.</li>
            <li>I do not use them very often either so it should not be because of desensitation to the scents.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them side by side with much more expensive oils and they hold their own, no difference.  </li>
            <li>I add 2-3 drops to the milk with oatmeal in the morning, a little bit of raw honey, and I have a delicious breakfast.</li>
            <li>This oil smells strong and lasts long time.</li>
            <li>Very nice, not too thin.</li>
            <li>Smells great but a little does not go a long way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten other oils from this company, and I love them all.</li>
            <li>I was really excited as I had bought a diffuser, and I bought different oils to use in it.</li>
            <li>Bought this and many other oils for the wife.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t last as long as i&#x27;d like but the scent is too amazing not to give it 5 stars</li>
            <li>I use this in my oil burner and my entire house smells clean.  </li>
            <li>I feel like they are high quality, fragrant oils at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I just started experimenting with more natural ways to clean my home and didn&#x27;t want to invest too much money on oils until I knew this \\&quot;green thing\\&quot; would work for our busy family.</li>
            <li>Someone mentioned to me the simple power of Sweet Orange</li>
            <li>I ordered a vial of the Sweet Orange Essential Oil from Eden&#x27;s Garden to use in my bath bombs and shower scrub.  </li>
            <li>I had tried the Blood Orange last month, and decided to try the Sweet Orange this time around.</li>
            <li>And, there will be no candles, flames, or anything hot near something called \\&quot;oil.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recently put together a batch of body butter with shea butter, coconut oil and added sweet orange and bergamot oils.</li>
            <li>This oil has a sweet orange scent similar to an orange creme popsicle.</li>
            <li>If you like fruity or sweet scents, definitely try this one.</li>
            <li>sweet orange oil is one you should buy in the largest quantity possible.</li>
            <li>Edens Garden Sweet Orange essential oil is one of our favorites!  </li>
            <li>Simple.. sweet citrus.  </li>
            <li>The oil took 3 days total to arrive, the sweet smell was immediately noticeable when I opened the package.</li>
            <li>Love the oil over more expensive versions.  </li>
            <li>Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be back to order more essential oils from Eden Gardens!!</li>
            <li>Very soft, gentle smell of yummy oranges.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>The oils are high quality and list the scientific name of the plant, the plants origin, and have no additives.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Just diagnosed with high BP and am trying to change my stress level.</li>

            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>, that is what is in this magical little bottle.</li>
            <li>I use this one because it seems to give me a little more energy plus it reminds me of summertime</li>
            <li>Great for candle and soap making, or a dab behind the ears and on your wrists!</li>
            <li>smell ok doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li>Just like a fresh orange the you just broke open.</li>
            <li>,it&#x27;s refreshing to any area of your house,just a few drops is all you need.</li>
            <li>love the scent I use everyday</li>
            <li>This scent does not last very long but while it is discernible, I enjoy it very much.</li>
            <li>Smells great but the smell doesn&#x27;t last long when I wipe furniture down with it.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s in my head, but I really feel like it helps my very active and easily distracted two year old to focus.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a strong smell, I added  a few drops of it to some coconut oil and eucerin lotion and my skin is so soft and it is certainly a mood lifter.</li>
            <li>You will live it.</li>
            <li>Not too sweet, strong, not too weak, etc.</li>
            <li>far as this particular oil goes...</li>
            <li>So anytime the toilet paper is used you get a fresh wiff of cinnamon.</li>
            <li>The smell did not seem very natural.</li>
            <li>First off, I adore Edens Garden essential oils.</li>
            <li>My first essential oil, so I can&#x27;t speak on the quality, but it seems wonderful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast shipping an great products, ill be a customer for life!</li>
            <li>I was not sure what to expect from this company, but I love their products.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased the Sweet Orange essential oil</li>
            <li>I use Sweet Orange oil for cleansing bath and other remedies that need citrus.</li>
            <li>Have found same quality and more product for less money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought alot of scents by this company and they were all true and not too sweet or weak</li>
            <li>The essential oils from this company are pure and fragrant.</li>
            <li>I put a little in an oil burner and it just filled the house with the scent.  </li>
            <li>All I can think is that these oils must be adequate in other ways, like putting on a tissue and smelling etc, but for my diffuser they are inadequate.</li>
            <li>Organic orange 100% Therapeutic oil disappointment me,  Smelled great for maybe thirty minutes and then the smell was gone.  </li>
            <li>It works well to clear my face.</li>
            <li>I also just made homemade, all natural deodorant with it tonight.</li>
            <li>I have some doTERRA Wild Orange</li>
            <li>so I can start creating natural body oils and creams.</li>
            <li>When my 3 year old got up, she asked where the oranges were and asked for one.</li>
            <li>And I appreciated the pamphlet that came with the order: 45 Ways To use Essential Oils.</li>
            <li>Then, I needed a few dollars to get free shipping at the company where I purchase all of my organic herbs.</li>
            <li>IT IS NATURAL AROMA</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how authentically orang</li>
            <li>Very peaceful scent, mixes well with other scents</li>
            <li>My order was shipped out the next day after ordering and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Early morning freshness</li>
            <li>Within 5 days of ordering I was surprised to check the mail and see my order had come in.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve used it in dryer sheets.  </li>
            <li>I added it to some Shea butter and its fragrance completely overshadowed that of the shea butter.</li>
            <li>they have a whole product line of essential oils.</li>
            <li>really prefer this to vanilla essential oil</li>
            <li>diffuse 4 Thieves and so far this winter we haven&#x27;t even been sick.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>WOW-</li>
            <li>Anyway, it&#x27;s natural and can be ingested, so I doubt it&#x27;s a problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was quite natural.</li>
            <li>Eden&#x27;s Garden are by far one of the cheapest places that sell this product</li>
            <li>This smells true to Orange Oil, however the fragrance just does not last as long as I would like it too.</li>
            <li>New to essential oils and am trying to learn what is normal and what is not.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic smell however only lasts for about 10-15 minutes so it doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li>Companies that sell Essential Oils generally don&#x27;t advertise too much that you can use these for food products.</li>
            <li>I also found I only need to use a few drops to get a sensational, long lasting scent!</li>
            <li>I use it in my diffuser along with lavender to promote sleep and calm my 2 1/2 year old down at bed time.</li>
            <li>I bought Sweet Orange and a few others</li>
            <li>I was completely new to essential oils and chose Edens Garden over the myriad of others because of reviews.  </li>
            <li>I am new to essential oils and didn&#x27;t think there was a difference in the brands.</li>
            <li>If they&#x27;re going to get ME as a buyer outside of the gift giving, I want a new car smell of plastic and leather.</li>
            <li>I also found it very helpful that they sent me a booklet on the essential oils and their uses, I also got a pamphlet with essential oil remedies.</li>
            <li>This is ok but not spectacular!</li>
            <li>I bought the Sweet Orange Essential Oil along with several other scents to use in my oil warmer.</li>
            <li>I could have spent twice as much on oils at the health food store and who can beat $2.99 shipping?</li>
            <li>I moisturize my skin and hair with olive oil, and I use a few drops of this sweet orange oil mixed with it to give it a pleasing fragrance.</li>
            <li>At the conclusion of our class as we bring our souls back into the present, our instructor stretches each student&#x27;s shoulders/neck/ other areas with a similar Sweet Orange scented lotion and yum.....</li>
            <li>But now that some time has passed and I tried other brands as well, I don&#x27;t think their oils are pure at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to perfumes, so am always looking for different ways to blend essential oils.</li>
            <li>you may imagine I went overboard and bought a lot of oils, lemon, key lime, mandarin, tangerine, clementine and sweet orange.</li>
            <li>Well, either I got a different product or that this is a fake review, and to be honest</li>
            <li>works ok, but smell was very subtle and I was using it for the smell</li>
            <li>Not crazy about it, The aroma is not strong enough</li>
            <li>It lists this as therapeutic but does not suggest internal intake because of the lack of FDA regulation and legal requirements - not because of any other reason.</li>
            <li>The first week I only had to use a few drops but after a month i have to put about 15 in.  </li>
            <li>The reason seems to be that because these are so concentrated, they can easily be over-used, and some of them can be dangerous in large quantities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not strange enough of a smell.</li>
            <li>Since the oil is potent and only used a few drops at a time, a little bottle will last me quite a long while.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
    </ol>

            <li> They smelled nice as I opened the bottle, so I guessed everything was fine.</li>
            <li> I think their potency is just as good as the higher priced oils!</li>

            <li> It smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love this scent.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more of a satsuma type scent</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s a bit like using a salt shaker and having the top come</li>
            <li> I have used oils extensively and these are superb.</li>
            <li> I LOVE all of the Oils I have purchased from Edens Garden,  </li>

            <li> I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just 4 stars because this isn&#x27;t our favorite oil out of their selection.  </li>

            <li> Lovely scent.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It was okay for the price I guess.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Already I am in love with it.  </li>
            <li> and everyone&#x27;s glad</li>
            <li> Love this oil.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> mmmmmm, love that smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to order some citronella (for mosquito repellant), peppermint and lavender (for \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot;- my friend tried it and has me convinced it&#x27;s better than store bought shampoo).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably add more oils to the collection once I get more \\&quot;recipes\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> and it couldn&#x27;t smell any better.</li>
            <li> So because they were cheaper, I bought many of Eden&#x27;s Garden oils.</li>
            <li> but now I have to replace all of the Eden&#x27;s Garden oils with better ones.</li>
            <li> Great prices and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I ordered two oils from the company and realized that there was an issue when they arrived (which was probably USPS more than them)</li>
            <li> Price is much better than most stores.</li>
            <li> I am pleased all the way around :) I have been using these in soaps, bath salts, homemade cleaning concoctions, laundry</li>
            <li> Love the smell of these one</li>
            <li> I need to order more.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances...</li>
            <li> but you can get better oils</li>
            <li> pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;It smells more like the orange peel, but yet refined.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural, smells great and the price is nice.</li>
            <li> Have enjoyed it in a diffuser.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s the latest.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love this one.  </li>
            <li> Had to get more.</li>

            <li> Love the aroma of this.</li>
            <li> The smell is potent, and they sent both a usage guide and catalog explaining all the oils they have.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> I used this to make Shea butter lotion, but it came with info of its many uses.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s lovely.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this.</li>

            <li> To me this smells more like Valencia Oranges not Navels.</li>
            <li> The scent is great and very orange.</li>
            <li> I just discovered it&#x27;s not my favorite scent, but if you like the smell of oranges, this is for you.</li>
            <li> I will eventually try many more of the scents.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more...</li>
            <li> not my favorite brand</li>
            <li> It creates a lovely and uplifting scent.</li>

            <li> because I just love the smell.  </li>
            <li> I love the naturalness of it.  </li>
            <li> I use it mostly to scent my laundry detergent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was a bit put off by the Biblical references that came in a pamphlet about how to use the oil, and I&#x27;m not even sure it&#x27;s supposed to be used as perfume though I was searching for that when these came up.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this Essential Oil to add to my exfoliating salt scrub and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Is not too sure about the advertised 100% purity of this item.</li>
            <li> and I love the oils</li>
            <li> The prices are great, the shipping is fast and the product is top quality.</li>

            <li> I have bought from this company many times.</li>
            <li> When my grand son comes over and has a sniffle, cough, or runny nose</li>
            <li> I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try more home crafts (lotions, cleaners, etc.)</li>

            <li> A couple drops goes a long way and the orange smell is awesome!</li>
            <li> Good value for your money thanks!</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I needed and at a good price.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as I&#x27;d like for it to be, so I just use a bit more.</li>
            <li> Every single bottle I have purchased has been wonderful!</li>
            <li> love love love this scent, its a true orange-y scent</li>
            <li> They sent a nice card worh 100 uses for essential oils and a very nice booklet explaining lots of scents and how to mix them along with carrier oil explanation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased Eden&#x27;s Garden&#x27;s oils before and have always been satisfied with the fine balance of quality and price.  </li>
            <li> Seems pure as stated, hasn&#x27;t lost it&#x27;s scent over time, consistency is liquid good and not thick.&lt;br /&gt;Mix</li>
            <li> also use a couple of drops of this oil in a bottle filled with water and vinegar which I use to clean counters with and it leaves a nice smell as compared to the vinegar</li>
            <li> This company offers quality oils for a great price.</li>
            <li> Plus, I suggest anyone try washing your sheets with a touch of lavender, a great natural sleep aid).</li>
            <li> I make this about 10% of my grapeseed-lavender-tea-tree blend and it makes everything blend in smoothly and silkily instead of sitting on top of my skin and looking shiny.  </li>
            <li> and it always gives my hair a lovely light</li>
            <li> I wear my hair natural and this oil is great keeping my scalp nourished.</li>
            <li> and it was not a sickening smell.</li>
            <li> Good price,shipped fast</li>
            <li> It gives the clothes a nice fresh smell.  </li>
            <li> Smells nice and fresh and invigorating.  </li>
            <li> Smells so good and is high quality!</li>
            <li> Their products are good and shipping is fast.</li>
            <li> It is a nice fresh scent to brighten up my day.</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of orange smell works well when making your own cleaning product.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and seems very pure.</li>
            <li> Whether you&#x27;re putting them in a diffuser or using them for other purposes, they are the best.</li>
            <li> (it is Sweet Orange after all!).  </li>
            <li> We sometimes add Sweet Orange to a carrier oil to use when massaging the horses or ourselves!  </li>
            <li> It is too easy to accidentally overdo it, and then you can&#x27;t remove the excess flavor</li>
            <li> I have never used essential oils before, but was able to get them and a great price.</li>
            <li> I use the peppermint oil and breathe easy oils when I&#x27;m congested</li>
            <li> The aroma is incredible the cent is true to the sweet orange, very rejuvenated , it&#x27;s a fresh wake up oil, love it</li>
            <li> and I love my house smelling like it after I clean instead of smelling like my vinegar cleaner.</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t as strong as I thought it would be</li>
            <li> Strongly suggest it for use in a diffuser.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t quite as strong as I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> This is a nice scent, yes it&#x27;s sweet orange but not too sweet.</li>
            <li> , it isn&#x27;t quite as strong of a citrus scent as you might except</li>
            <li> We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> Love the sweet orange.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more at full price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One of my favorite uses of it is in a toner water made with lemon, sweet orange, and tea tree oils.</li>
            <li> So far, i am loving the smell!</li>
            <li> I love this sweet orange oil.  </li>
            <li> I love the Sweet Orange oil.</li>
            <li> At first I put excellent ratings, it was my first time purchasing essential oils and to be honest</li>
            <li> I love love love this oil, it&#x27;s my favorite by far.</li>
            <li> very nice, edens garden sells good quality essential oils at a reasonable price</li>
            <li> The Sweet Orange has more of a light, airy scent to it while the Blood Orange had a deeper scent.</li>
            <li> I combine some of these based on his symptoms and run it in my diffusor and he is fine all night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure, and quickly too.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super speedy too!</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail today, and it shipped rather quickly!</li>
            <li> Delivered Quickly!</li>
            <li> I love putting it in a pot of boiling water to make my home smell like one nice sweet orange that just got peeled and is ready to be eaten.  </li>
            <li> The smell is nice and my place smells like sweet oranges right now.</li>
            <li> Super amazing, will certainly be ordering more from them.</li>
            <li> I will also drop orange with lemon (about 6 drops of each into each lamp), everyone who comes over when I do this always asks how I make my home smell so clean, and it is a fresh smell and not the soap aisle clean kind of smell.</li>
            <li> i used it 2 days now and is my favorite smell is not strong or too sweet... is so fragrant my room smelled wonderfully</li>
            <li> love the scent its strong and last a good while.</li>
            <li> HIGH QUALITY AND QUICK DELIVERY!!!</li>
            <li> I made some orange peppermint toothpaste from coconut oil and baking soda and the taste of these oils is very refreshing and high quality.</li>
            <li> This truly is the way oranges smell and the aroma is invigorating and light.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a quality product that would impart a light scent to my towels.</li>
            <li> Customer service is nice and replies very timely.</li>
            <li> They really have a nice smell.</li>
            <li> Great smelling essential oil!</li>
            <li> Great product just not enough</li>
            <li> so many useful ways to use this.</li>
            <li> Made me want fresh squeezed OJ :)</li>
            <li> Mixe a few drops of this with bio oil is wonderful..</li>
            <li> This is a great essential oil.</li>
            <li> Eventually, I want to purchase an essential oil diffuser and diffuse this happy scent throughout my room.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> OMG, the smell is fantastic..  </li>
            <li> I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM.</li>
            <li> We also enjoy adding it to our humidifier in winter as it adds a soothing aroma to the air.  </li>
            <li> They are cheap.</li>
            <li> This oil is great to add to your regular hair oil for stimulating your scalp.</li>
            <li> This is a great company selling quality oils at low prices.</li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll love this product, you can put a two or three drops in your bath and it smells a whole bathroom like oranges I love that</li>
            <li> I went right to the company and purchased more and shipping was free because I bought quite a lot.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as strong as I was hoping for, I am sure just a regular orange one would be, but it is nice and sweet smelling!</li>
            <li> Next to lavender, it is my absolute FAVORITE!!!</li>
            <li> From all of them, sweet orange is the nicest, not too strong and</li>
            <li> The orange is sweet and strong.</li>
            <li> My whole family loves this oil!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice essential oil</li>
            <li> Love the fresh clean orange scent.  </li>
            <li> But, loving the lemon and orange in particular, my wife made a request for cinnamon (for the kitchen primarily) and gardenia.</li>
            <li> More power to them for taking the same exact product and charging an arm and a leg for them lol.</li>
            <li> smell like oranges but not like super strong</li>
            <li> My new favorite!</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite!</li>
            <li> I love using this oil, in my oil burner just dilute it with a little water, the house smells fresh, clean, and a wonderful citrus scent, not to strong, and not to weak, just perfect, will continue to keep buying this oil..</li>
            <li> Fresh and clean!</li>
            <li> I still like this Sweet Orange though and use it as a hand moisturizer (love that I don&#x27;t need to wipe excess oil off; it seeps right into my skin without leaving me oily) and in my conditioner.</li>
            <li> I originally bought it thinking it was</li>
            <li> I love love love this brand of essential oils.</li>
            <li> Excited to see all the ways i can use it...</li>
            <li> I love it so much!</li>
            <li> Just clean, citrusy, orangeness.</li>
            <li> Use it to make the house smell clean.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, people have not tried better products if they give such amazing reviews to this item.</li>
            <li> Our horses love the fragrance of Sweet Orange, so we let them inhale the aroma straight from the bottle!  </li>
            <li> I especially love mixing it with other oils as the orange smell is not overpowering but blends very well.</li>
            <li> I prefer to pay more and get a pure oil than this quality ever again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;HIGHLY recommended for someone special, i.e., someone whose tastes you know.</li>
            <li> They seem to utilize excellent extraction procedures as well as quality control in the manufacture of their products.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend to anyone interested in essential oils.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweet smelling, but not a sick sweet.</li>
            <li> It smelled citrusy like oranges, and sweet like chemicals.</li>
            <li> The Sweet Orange smells just like an orange.  </li>
            <li> The company puts a lot of love into their products and the bottles look absolutely</li>
            <li> Not as sweet smelling as I thought</li>
            <li> I thought they were good because I did not know how essential oils should be.</li>
            <li> I keep ordering these incenses as they last, and are a good quality incense.</li>
            <li> SWEET ORANGE IS</li>
            <li> (I am allergic to the fragrance in their waxes) because I wanted something to make my living room smell good occasionally.</li>
            <li> I mixed with a carrier oil to use after shower and it smells good.  </li>
            <li> Bought to use in homemade face oil for my oily, acne prone skin (sweet orange oil is an astringent).</li>
            <li> I was raised in a county full of oranges.</li>
            <li> Out of the three oils that I purchased (lemon, sweet orange, and melaleuca), this oil was my second-favorite.</li>
            <li> really like this, also has many uses.</li>
            <li> but thankfully that does not hold true for this oil.  </li>
            <li> I ordered Sweet Orange, Clove, Tea Tree and Bergamot oils.</li>
            <li> I have gone through two bottles of sweet orange.</li>
            <li> Especially for candles but all in all a good inexpensive product.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff, look no further!</li>
            <li> The sweet fragrance of this oil is just heavenly.</li>
            <li> thanks, I love to diffuse this,,,smells</li>
            <li> sweet orange is really good mixed with vanilla as well.</li>
            <li> The orange oil give the soap a sweet, fresh scent that lightly lingers on your hands after washing them.  </li>
            <li> I use a few drops of this with coconut oil and Oil of Cloves in my Scent Warmer......smells soooo good!</li>
            <li> and I love receiving the tips sheet on different uses for the oils as well as the beautiful catalog which also explains uses for these essential oils.</li>
            <li> ( personally i use this sweet orange oil in my skincare products), love love</li>

            <li> That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden.</li>

            <li> I love the smell of Sweet Orange Essential Oil (sold by Eden&#x27;s Garden).</li>
            <li> I love the smell of orange, and you can definitely tell this is sweet orange</li>
            <li> True essential orange oil has more of a purpose than for scentsty burners and food.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Simple, sweet, and pure.  </li>
            <li> I use it for so much, but my favorite use is to but a few drops on my wool dryer balls to make my laundry smell fabulous!!</li>
            <li> The scent is exactly like fresh orange peels.  </li>
            <li> It really smelled like I was peeling sweet oranges in the kitchen</li>
            <li> This essential oil smells absolutely amazing and can be used for so many different things!</li>
            <li> Really does smell like sweet orange peels &amp;#60;3 ...</li>
            <li> and they were so friendly and easy to communicate with, that I will buy essential oils from them from here on out for that reason if nothing else!</li>
            <li> I contacted the company, and a new bottle was immediately sent to replace, free if charges, including shipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a happy scent; a definite mood lifter.</li>
            <li> It smells very nice, blended well with the mixture and was not overwhelming.  </li>

            <li> My first time using this scent and can&#x27;t wait until I put it in my mixes.</li>

            <li> Was exactly as needed and described.</li>
            <li> It is safer to put the drops into a spoon first rather than trying to shake them out over the food.</li>
            <li> Potent and mysterious.  </li>
            <li> I am a massage therapist, and love to theme the scents in my room to the season (as much as possible), So this is one that I used for summer!  </li>
            <li> I Love mixing these different oils.</li>
            <li> Exactly want I wanted.</li>
            <li> but I definitely recommend it...and will be ordering more...</li>
            <li> AND IT IS REAL ORANGE OIL USEFUL</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t wait to buy more scents from the same brand &amp; seller.</li>
            <li> It works alright for that purpose, but it takes a lot of oil (10 drops or more) and the scent only lasts for about 30 minutes before it dries up.</li>
            <li> Smells like the real fruit!</li>
            <li> I love it and will purchase again in the future!</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to make my first \\&quot;batch\\&quot; of lotion.</li>
            <li> it was exactly what they described.</li>
            <li> It is exactly as it was advertised.</li>

            <li> I ordered several bottles of different oil and they included an awesome booklet with all their scents with description and a 101 uses for essential oils pamphlet...</li>
            <li> I put a few drops in my hot bath &amp; had room smelling good.</li>

            <li> A little goes a very long way, but it smells so delicious that you&#x27;ll use it for everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am excited to see what other oils I may mix this one with and come up with other creative scents on my own.</li>
            <li> The scent of the orange oil is very nice and delicate.  </li>
            <li> Nice scent to use in my lotion and other body products.</li>
            <li> Smell nice and a fracrion of the price of other citrus oils.</li>
            <li> I really love all the oils I have bought from Edens Garden so its hard to choose my favorite this one I like to use with my plug in diffuser</li>
            <li> Fairly priced, came much much quicker than expected, and smells DIVINE!!!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to everyone who wants to live a healthy lifestyle with all natural products.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s every bit as good as the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> i choose this high rating, because this is a product i would reorder again.this product has the scent of fresh oranges.and</li>
            <li> (My significant other is highly allergic to tide and other fragrance laden soaps, so I was thrilled to find that I can wash our clothes with essential oils such as orange as an additive to give our clothes a great clean smell without breaking him out.</li>
            <li> I am not a dealer, do not know anyone associated with this company, do not work in this industry and am given nothing for giving positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Smells great by itself or mixed with other oil scents.</li>
            <li> I have ordered several different oils at different times they provide a very good fast service</li>
            <li> it works great for common coughs and colds!</li>
            <li> The product is just as described and in my opinion is very high quality.  </li>
            <li> even though this oil had less of that chemical type smell than aura caccia, there is nothing sweet about this aroma, it has a strong chemical type smell which could be inherent in the oil or not.</li>
            <li> I put about 20 drops on to my furnace filter and the whole house smelled fabulous, but only for about an hour or two.</li>
            <li> Price was doable; used it for my hair, my skin and the scent is very calming.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t pay 2-3 times as much for &amp;#34;designer&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I received this product much sooner than expected.&lt;br /&gt;Would order from them again.</li>

            <li> real orange.</li>
            <li> The two I bought from this company are really inadequate when it comes to aromatherapy, I believe.</li>

            <li> I really like this eo</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like real oranges.</li>
            <li> I do not use them very often either so it should not be because of desensitation to the scents.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them side by side with much more expensive oils and they hold their own, no difference.  </li>
            <li> I add 2-3 drops to the milk with oatmeal in the morning, a little bit of raw honey, and I have a delicious breakfast.</li>
            <li> This oil smells strong and lasts long time.</li>
            <li> Very nice, not too thin.</li>
            <li> Smells great but a little does not go a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten other oils from this company, and I love them all.</li>
            <li> I was really excited as I had bought a diffuser, and I bought different oils to use in it.</li>
            <li> Bought this and many other oils for the wife.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t last as long as i&#x27;d like but the scent is too amazing not to give it 5 stars</li>
            <li> I use this in my oil burner and my entire house smells clean.  </li>
            <li> I feel like they are high quality, fragrant oils at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I just started experimenting with more natural ways to clean my home and didn&#x27;t want to invest too much money on oils until I knew this \\&quot;green thing\\&quot; would work for our busy family.</li>
            <li> Someone mentioned to me the simple power of Sweet Orange</li>
            <li> I ordered a vial of the Sweet Orange Essential Oil from Eden&#x27;s Garden to use in my bath bombs and shower scrub.  </li>
            <li> I had tried the Blood Orange last month, and decided to try the Sweet Orange this time around.</li>
            <li> And, there will be no candles, flames, or anything hot near something called \\&quot;oil.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recently put together a batch of body butter with shea butter, coconut oil and added sweet orange and bergamot oils.</li>
            <li> This oil has a sweet orange scent similar to an orange creme popsicle.</li>
            <li> If you like fruity or sweet scents, definitely try this one.</li>
            <li> sweet orange oil is one you should buy in the largest quantity possible.</li>
            <li> Edens Garden Sweet Orange essential oil is one of our favorites!  </li>
            <li> Simple.. sweet citrus.  </li>
            <li> The oil took 3 days total to arrive, the sweet smell was immediately noticeable when I opened the package.</li>
            <li> Love the oil over more expensive versions.  </li>
            <li> Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be back to order more essential oils from Eden Gardens!!</li>
            <li> Very soft, gentle smell of yummy oranges.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> The oils are high quality and list the scientific name of the plant, the plants origin, and have no additives.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Just diagnosed with high BP and am trying to change my stress level.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is heavenly and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> these are high quality oils.</li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> , that is what is in this magical little bottle.</li>
            <li> I use this one because it seems to give me a little more energy plus it reminds me of summertime</li>
            <li> Great for candle and soap making, or a dab behind the ears and on your wrists!</li>
            <li> smell ok doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> Just like a fresh orange the you just broke open.</li>
            <li> ,it&#x27;s refreshing to any area of your house,just a few drops is all you need.</li>
            <li> love the scent I use everyday</li>
            <li> This scent does not last very long but while it is discernible, I enjoy it very much.</li>
            <li> Smells great but the smell doesn&#x27;t last long when I wipe furniture down with it.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s in my head, but I really feel like it helps my very active and easily distracted two year old to focus.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a strong smell, I added  a few drops of it to some coconut oil and eucerin lotion and my skin is so soft and it is certainly a mood lifter.</li>
            <li> You will live it.</li>
            <li> Not too sweet, strong, not too weak, etc.</li>
            <li> far as this particular oil goes...</li>
            <li> So anytime the toilet paper is used you get a fresh wiff of cinnamon.</li>
            <li> The smell did not seem very natural.</li>
            <li> First off, I adore Edens Garden essential oils.</li>
            <li> My first essential oil, so I can&#x27;t speak on the quality, but it seems wonderful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast shipping an great products, ill be a customer for life!</li>
            <li> I was not sure what to expect from this company, but I love their products.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the Sweet Orange essential oil</li>
            <li> I use Sweet Orange oil for cleansing bath and other remedies that need citrus.</li>
            <li> Have found same quality and more product for less money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought alot of scents by this company and they were all true and not too sweet or weak</li>
            <li> The essential oils from this company are pure and fragrant.</li>
            <li> I put a little in an oil burner and it just filled the house with the scent.  </li>
            <li> All I can think is that these oils must be adequate in other ways, like putting on a tissue and smelling etc, but for my diffuser they are inadequate.</li>
            <li> Organic orange 100% Therapeutic oil disappointment me,  Smelled great for maybe thirty minutes and then the smell was gone.  </li>
            <li> It works well to clear my face.</li>
            <li> I also just made homemade, all natural deodorant with it tonight.</li>
            <li> I have some doTERRA Wild Orange</li>
            <li> so I can start creating natural body oils and creams.</li>
            <li> When my 3 year old got up, she asked where the oranges were and asked for one.</li>
            <li> And I appreciated the pamphlet that came with the order: 45 Ways To use Essential Oils.</li>
            <li> Then, I needed a few dollars to get free shipping at the company where I purchase all of my organic herbs.</li>
            <li> IT IS NATURAL AROMA</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how authentically orang</li>
            <li> Very peaceful scent, mixes well with other scents</li>
            <li> My order was shipped out the next day after ordering and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Early morning freshness</li>
            <li> Within 5 days of ordering I was surprised to check the mail and see my order had come in.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used it in dryer sheets.  </li>
            <li> I added it to some Shea butter and its fragrance completely overshadowed that of the shea butter.</li>
            <li> they have a whole product line of essential oils.</li>
            <li> really prefer this to vanilla essential oil</li>
            <li> diffuse 4 Thieves and so far this winter we haven&#x27;t even been sick.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> WOW-</li>
            <li> Anyway, it&#x27;s natural and can be ingested, so I doubt it&#x27;s a problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was quite natural.</li>
            <li> Eden&#x27;s Garden are by far one of the cheapest places that sell this product</li>
            <li> This smells true to Orange Oil, however the fragrance just does not last as long as I would like it too.</li>
            <li> New to essential oils and am trying to learn what is normal and what is not.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic smell however only lasts for about 10-15 minutes so it doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> Companies that sell Essential Oils generally don&#x27;t advertise too much that you can use these for food products.</li>
            <li> I also found I only need to use a few drops to get a sensational, long lasting scent!</li>
            <li> I use it in my diffuser along with lavender to promote sleep and calm my 2 1/2 year old down at bed time.</li>
            <li> I bought Sweet Orange and a few others</li>
            <li> I was completely new to essential oils and chose Edens Garden over the myriad of others because of reviews.  </li>
            <li> I am new to essential oils and didn&#x27;t think there was a difference in the brands.</li>
            <li> If they&#x27;re going to get ME as a buyer outside of the gift giving, I want a new car smell of plastic and leather.</li>
            <li> I also found it very helpful that they sent me a booklet on the essential oils and their uses, I also got a pamphlet with essential oil remedies.</li>
            <li> This is ok but not spectacular!</li>
            <li> I bought the Sweet Orange Essential Oil along with several other scents to use in my oil warmer.</li>
            <li> I could have spent twice as much on oils at the health food store and who can beat $2.99 shipping?</li>
            <li> I moisturize my skin and hair with olive oil, and I use a few drops of this sweet orange oil mixed with it to give it a pleasing fragrance.</li>
            <li> At the conclusion of our class as we bring our souls back into the present, our instructor stretches each student&#x27;s shoulders/neck/ other areas with a similar Sweet Orange scented lotion and yum.....</li>
            <li> But now that some time has passed and I tried other brands as well, I don&#x27;t think their oils are pure at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive to perfumes, so am always looking for different ways to blend essential oils.</li>
            <li> you may imagine I went overboard and bought a lot of oils, lemon, key lime, mandarin, tangerine, clementine and sweet orange.</li>
            <li> Well, either I got a different product or that this is a fake review, and to be honest</li>
            <li> works ok, but smell was very subtle and I was using it for the smell</li>
            <li> Not crazy about it, The aroma is not strong enough</li>
            <li> It lists this as therapeutic but does not suggest internal intake because of the lack of FDA regulation and legal requirements - not because of any other reason.</li>
            <li> The first week I only had to use a few drops but after a month i have to put about 15 in.  </li>
            <li> The reason seems to be that because these are so concentrated, they can easily be over-used, and some of them can be dangerous in large quantities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not strange enough of a smell.</li>
            <li> Since the oil is potent and only used a few drops at a time, a little bottle will last me quite a long while.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> a drop or two on the vacuum filter will work to freshen your room while vacuuming and last a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> The fluid burns quickly, not as effective as other brands available in the market.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing other products from this selllwr again in the near future.</li>
            <li> I also use it my vacuum cleaner bags to freshen the house.</li>
            <li> I ordered four oils from this company for use in my natural toothpastes and deoderants and other beauty uses.</li>
            <li> This product is highly concentrated, so you only need a few drops.</li>
            <li> Scent last a long while.</li>
            <li> This one also doesn&#x27;t seem to linger as long as the Blood Orange, and it definitely smells sweeter</li>
            <li> Oils are concentrated and last a long time.</li>
            <li> But after a while the smell would last long.</li>
            <li> I was hopping for stronger...and long lasting smell - I even got two bottles -</li>
            <li> but doesnt last very long.</li>
            <li> Other brands of oils I have ordered have had either strange scents and did not smell like they should have or the scent was barely there</li>
            <li> From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden.</li>
            <li> I have only dropped a few drops into a bit of water on my warmer and no other scents were added.</li>
            <li> and I expected the scent to last longer.</li>
            <li> The smell is so relaxing and lasts for so long.  </li>
            <li> and it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Wyndmere is organic even though for some strange reason they choose not to disclose this.</li>
            <li> This is the first poor review I have given, and I am the only person to have done so.</li>
            <li> I usually order my favorites and add a new one in to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also have blended with other oils for different uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several other oils from Eden&#x27;s Garden</li>
            <li> I put 4 drops of this and 3 drops of the Eden&#x27;s Garden Peppermint Essential Oil on a pinecone and set it down in my bedroom.</li>
            <li> no smell, left a black tar stuck on my glass...</li>
            <li> small bottle goes a long way, and I have found that these last a long time in the cupboard.</li>
            <li> I wish the fragrance last a little longer..</li>
            <li> A little book was included with the order (no charge) that showed all their different oils with examples of what illnesses they could help alleviate.</li>
            <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living.</li>
            <li> You do have to be careful though...</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t at all what I expected.</li>
            <li> also put a few drops on cotton balls and place them in various spots in my house.</li>
            <li> So beware and be careful when placing your order.</li>
            <li> Come as expected.</li>
            <li> Of course, I have to be careful when using it as citrus can burn.</li>
            <li> My daughter adds a few drops to the final rinse water when washing her hair.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased quite a few different oils from Eden&#x27;s Garden before.</li>
            <li> Only a few drops</li>
            <li> I run these a lot and the aroma is what is to be expected.</li>
            <li> I kept the bottles closed and even have tried shaking them thinking the scent might have seperated out</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nevertheless, they are natural products, and so, if used sparingly, work much better in baking than those horrible \\&quot;artificial flavors\\&quot; that are available in supermarkets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to mixing it with other scents to make a beard oil.</li>
            <li> Works well with other scents too.  </li>
            <li> I purchased 4 different oils from this company, I&#x27;m not satisfied at ALL with ANY of them.</li>
            <li> Other times, I use to fragrance up the house.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to blend with other oils I purchased on Amazon to create a bathroom spray.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll stick with my other brand.</li>
            <li> Works well in the diffuser and it works well with my other oils.</li>
            <li> Not sure-- no longer going to attempt mixing oil scents for personal use--</li>
            <li> like i found with other brands.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to trying other scents from Edens Garden.  </li>
            <li> wish the oil lasted longer on my burner plate.i have to refill it after about 30 mins some of my other oils burn slower</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try other</li>
            <li> put a few drops with some oil and rubbed it into my dry hands...</li>
            <li> I started trying the essential oils after getting tired of the same fragrances on body lotions and candles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to these natural oils!</li>
            <li> With the cinnamon oil I usually put a drop on the inside of the toilet paper roll.</li>
            <li> and I had to let her smell the bottle to convince her there were no fresh oranges.</li>
            <li> it all comes down to insurance as to whether it&#x27;s edible or not.</li>
            <li> I am using it to &#x27;sniff&#x27; the cortisol levels down in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Nothing like other brands!</li>
            <li> Not strong as expected.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed because I love Eden&#x27;s Garden essential oils.</li>
            <li> just made some home-made Peanut Butter Cups the other day, using Green &amp; Black organic dark chocolate, with just a touch of orange oil.</li>
            <li> Try putting a drop or two on a few cotton balls, put the cotton balls in a small plastic bag (smaller than a sandwich bag)close it and poke a few holes in the bag.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone that loves citrus products, and don&#x27;t be afraid to mix and match different oils, you might be pleasantly surprised...</li>
            <li> I have purchased from this vendor previously, always prompt quality oils.</li>
            <li> I like the multiples uses for combatting colds and lifting the energy in the home as citrus typically does along with that</li>
            <li> I accidentally spilled half the bottle and one would think there would be an orange aroma.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweet but not in a sickly, overpowering way.</li>
            <li> Such a pleasing aroma, sweet without being sickening.</li>
            <li> You have to use a lot of it to even smell it a little bit.</li>
            <li> I put a little baking soda and then about 10 drops of whichever oil</li>
            <li> A lot goes a little way.</li>
            <li> I like putting a few drops in the bath.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops on the bottom of the shower and that was all that was needed to awaken me.  </li>
            <li> I put some on a cotton round and just set it out in my living room.</li>
            <li> I use this along with their Jasmine oil, put a few drops in a spray bottle and makes every room (and my car) smell heavenly.</li>
            <li> I put 20 drops of this oil in my diffuser and smelled nothing, while another user said with just a few drops on cotton balls her closet smells heavenly.</li>
            <li> I just wasted money that can not use</li>
            <li> I make a few holes in the lids and place them in closets and my bathroom.</li>
            <li> - it smells for a few minutes</li>
            <li> Jus wish the smell lingered longer, it needs to be re-applied after a couple or few hours</li>
            <li> I use just a few drops with water and place a small candle underneath.</li>
            <li> All you do is rub a small amount onto chest @ night, and do so for a few days!</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I usually get blends.  </li>
            <li> they only have a faint smell.</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> Used a few drops in my orange rhubarb bread.....yummmo!</li>
            <li> Small amount for price.</li>
            <li> Though the bottle seems small, it holds a lot of oil.</li>
            <li> or maybe I should have gone with different types/more expensive oils.  </li>
            <li> Much much better than store bought junk with nasty chemicals.</li>
            <li> I put it in a small spray bottle with water</li>
            <li> I was not sure what to expect when I ordered this product.</li>
            <li> I hate to be the first downer but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a college student, so sleep is difficult at times, which makes for long days!</li>
            <li> , im a hard one to please, but this product meets all what i demanded from this product.</li>
            <li> Not thrilled.</li>
            <li> I mean come on</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> so was not happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Addicted to Edens Garden oils.</li>
            <li> I think the quality of this oil is really poor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so tired of smelling canned aerosols that smell like fake food.</li>
            <li> Have about 20 different oils and have yet to be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Fragrance is weak in a diffuser !</li>
            <li> Was very weak smelt like it was losing shelf life didn&#x27;t stink or anything just very weak</li>
            <li> you cannot go wrong purchasing from this&lt;br /&gt;Company.&lt;br /&gt;Nancy</li>

            <li> OMG the smell is soo good :) going to use this for bath, lotions and as scent for room :) The delivery was fast and thanks for that also :)) best regards</li>
            <li> no smell, left a black tar stuck on my glass...10 more words required....oh my god i have nothing more to say but save your money</li>
            <li> Price was doable; used it for my hair, my skin and the scent is very calming. Will definiately buy again</li>
            <li> First off, I adore Edens Garden essential oils. I have lots of them... I feel like they are high quality, fragrant oils at a reasonable price. Seriously good stuff!!! Don&#x27;t pay 2-3 times as much for &amp;#34;designer&amp;#34; oils sold from a multi level marketing business. More power to them for taking the same exact product and charging an arm and a leg for them lol. As for me, I&#x27;ll stick with this lovely company.&lt;br /&gt;As far as this particular oil goes... Next to lavender, it is my absolute FAVORITE!!! The smell is mouth watering!! Truly!!! I use it in my diffuser along with lavender to promote sleep and calm my 2 1/2 year old down at bed time. I also just made homemade, all natural deodorant with it tonight. Haven&#x27;t tried it out yet, but it sure smells DIVINE!!!&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE it and will definitely buy again and again</li>
            <li> Good price,shipped fast</li>
            <li> I like to blenb this with Geranium. It leaves a pleasant scent and makes the room a nice place and curl up, even for a nap or the read a book, or just have some me time.</li>
            <li> You open the bottle and it feels like you crawled inside a bottle of orange peel oil. It smells fantastic! I&#x27;m looking forward to mixing it with other scents to make a beard oil. It&#x27;s sweet smelling, but not a sick sweet. Just clean, citrusy, orangeness. I dig it!</li>
            <li> It smelled citrusy like oranges, and sweet like chemicals.</li>
            <li> smell ok doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> I love this scent. My first time using this scent and can&#x27;t wait until I put it in my mixes. I will order more later.</li>
            <li> Great product. Smells womderful</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing!!! I originally bought it thinking it was a massage oil LOL it works great for common coughs and colds! All you do is rub a small amount onto chest @ night, and do so for a few days! My gosh! You will see your symptoms start to subside! love it!!! need a giant bottle!!</li>
            <li> Delivery was good.  Good quality oil.  The scent is exactly like fresh orange peels.  I was expecting more of a satsuma type scent but it&#x27;s growing on me.  I like putting a few drops in the bath.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the fragrance - it&#x27;s like peeling an orange!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  I use it as a air freshener throughout my home.&lt;br /&gt;Edens Garden is a great company with great customer service.  I received this product much sooner than expected.&lt;br /&gt;Would order from them again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!! Was exactly as needed and described. Will be ordering from them again!!</li>
            <li> Companies that sell Essential Oils generally don&#x27;t advertise too much that you can use these for food products. The reason seems to be that because these are so concentrated, they can easily be over-used, and some of them can be dangerous in large quantities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, they are natural products, and so, if used sparingly, work much better in baking than those horrible \\&quot;artificial flavors\\&quot; that are available in supermarkets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Mint oil, and this Orange oil for chocolate making, and they work beautifully. You do have to be careful though...a drop or two is all you need. It is safer to put the drops into a spoon first rather than trying to shake them out over the food. It is too easy to accidentally overdo it, and then you can&#x27;t remove the excess flavor (it&#x27;s a bit like using a salt shaker and having the top come off!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just made some home-made Peanut Butter Cups the other day, using Green &amp; Black organic dark chocolate, with just a touch of orange oil. They turned out just great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A small bottle goes a long way, and I have found that these last a long time in the cupboard. For the price, these are a great value.</li>
            <li> Great for the diffuser for fall</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> This company offers quality oils for a great price. I&#x27;ve used them side by side with much more expensive oils and they hold their own, no difference.  I use for health, cleaning and aromatic purposes and have not been disappointed. I have used oils extensively and these are superb. Will continue to purchase from Edens Garden if they have what I need. I am not a dealer, do not know anyone associated with this company, do not work in this industry and am given nothing for giving positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Love this oil!!!  I&#x27;ve been purchasing some Edens Garden oils to try and replace my doTERRA oils.  Some don&#x27;t compare but this one is really great!  I have some doTERRA Wild Orange and I truly can&#x27;t tell the difference.  I&#x27;ll be buying this one again.</li>
            <li> HIGH QUALITY AND QUICK DELIVERY!!!</li>
            <li> Used this one for a craft too. I make home made air freshener and I give them away for presents</li>
            <li> good price and speedy delivery</li>
            <li> I LOVE all of the Oils I have purchased from Edens Garden,  they are so nice in fragrance and in quality.&lt;br /&gt;I also love the catalog they send with your purchases.....you cannot go wrong purchasing from this&lt;br /&gt;Company.&lt;br /&gt;Nancy Miles&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> This scent is wonderful. I got it to mix in my vinegar cleaner to cut the smell. They sent a nice card worh 100 uses for essential oils and a very nice booklet explaining lots of scents and how to mix them along with carrier oil explanation.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT SMELLS DELICIOUS JUST LIKE REAL ORANGES NONE OF THAT ARTIFICIAL CHEMICAL ODOR I LOVE IT I USE IT IN MY HOMEMADE HAIR CONDITIONERS AND SOAPS</li>
            <li> I am a first time buyer of essential oils and kept reading how great they were for adding lasting scent to your home. I ordered 4 oils including this one. The scent of the orange oil is very nice and delicate.  However, I was expecting the oils to have a stronger scent and I expected the scent to last longer. I put about 10-15 drops on cotton balls and placed them around the house. The smell was wonderful, but just for a couple hours. It wasn&#x27;t at all what I expected. I put about 20 drops on to my furnace filter and the whole house smelled fabulous, but only for about an hour or two. I also tried putting 10+ drops on folded paper towels and tucking those into several heat vents. Again, smelled great for about an hour or two but that&#x27;s it.    Nothing against the product, the bottles are lovely and all the scents were very nice. I&#x27;ll use them all up I&#x27;m sure, and quickly too.</li>
            <li> Love the oil over more expensive versions.  It&#x27;s just 4 stars because this isn&#x27;t our favorite oil out of their selection.  The oils are high quality and list the scientific name of the plant, the plants origin, and have no additives.  It lists this as therapeutic but does not suggest internal intake because of the lack of FDA regulation and legal requirements - not because of any other reason.</li>
            <li> I hate to be the first downer but even though this oil had less of that chemical type smell than aura caccia, there is nothing sweet about this aroma, it has a strong chemical type smell which could be inherent in the oil or not.</li>
            <li> The Sweet Orange smells just like an orange.  This works great in the sugar scrub that I made for my mom.  Smells so good.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. Just like a fresh orange the you just broke open. I use it in my Shea butter mix for my hair. Amazing.</li>
            <li> I bought this to make home made poopouri. Perfect.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll like this product.  The TGE oils are all genuine and very aromatic!  However you choose to use it you won&#x27;t be disappointed by the scent.  A little goes a long way.  Orange is my favorite- there&#x27;s something about citrus that just awakens the senses and boosts energy.  I mix this with everything (almost) lotion, hair products, home made linen freshener (water and Sweet Orange oil), non-scented bath oil an shower gel, candles, and bar soap... LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Added this oil to my concoction for hair and body rubbing oils.</li>
            <li> Love this oil! I use it in my face scrub and my daughter likes to use it as a perfume.</li>
            <li> Wonderful fresh aroma!!</li>
            <li> I love love love this brand of essential oils. I bought several bottles and love each and every one of them!</li>
            <li> Excellent. smells wonderful. will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Very pleasant and refreshing smell!</li>
            <li> Oils smell good. Love the verity of scents</li>
            <li> Lovely scent.  Potent and mysterious.  My first essential oil, so I can&#x27;t speak on the quality, but it seems wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller/producer is great, too, as they ship with a coupon for their home website. :)</li>
            <li> This product arrived in great time, within five days of ordering and it smells great. Love it. I will order from this vendor again. My plans are to create a collection of key essential oils so I can start creating natural body oils and creams.</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t as strong as I thought it would be so I gave it 3 stars. You have to use a lot of it to even smell it a little bit. It was okay for the price I guess.</li>
            <li> My whole family loves this oil!!!</li>
            <li> I use Sweet Orange oil for cleansing bath and other remedies that need citrus.All the oils at Eden&#x27;s Garden.com are dependable and quick shipping. Myra  Blessed BE!    (...)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so wonderful to know that \\&quot;Sweet Orange\\&quot; is one of those oils that is going to be inexpensive, and I was thrilled with the sale Eden&#x27;s Garden had on this one.  I&#x27;ve purchased Eden&#x27;s Garden&#x27;s oils before and have always been satisfied with the fine balance of quality and price.  The company puts a lot of love into their products and the bottles look absolutely charming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I usually get blends.  Someone mentioned to me the simple power of Sweet Orange and I figured I would try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Already I am in love with it.  This truly is the way oranges smell and the aroma is invigorating and light.  I put a few drops on the bottom of the shower and that was all that was needed to awaken me.  I diffused it at the office and everyone&#x27;s glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple, sweet, and pure.  Love this oil.</li>
            <li> Great Value.  Love the sweet orange.</li>
            <li> a lovely orange scent great for making you more energized</li>
            <li> Not as strong as I would have liked</li>
            <li> This smells awesome! I love it. I put some on a cotton round and just set it out in my living room. Mmm, it makes the whole room smell like summer.</li>
            <li> The essential oils from this company are pure and fragrant. The sweet orange oil is great for cleaning and for using in aromatherapy or colognes.</li>
            <li> has helped me stay well in this ohio changing weather.  rub over my glands.</li>
            <li> I have never used essential oils before, but was able to get them and a great price. This product is so much better than I expected. I will be buying more at full price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put a few drops with some oil and rubbed it into my dry hands...mmm they smell wonderful and so smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product purchased at a discount as part of a promotion. I was neither paid nor sponsored for my opinions--positive or otherwise--and all thoughts reflected in this review are solely my own</li>
            <li> A great product...mmmmmm, love that smell.</li>
            <li> I am a massage therapist, and love to theme the scents in my room to the season (as much as possible), So this is one that I used for summer!  My clients loved it! Wonderful orange scent!  And Edens Garden is always a pleasure to work with!</li>
            <li> I ordered a number of oils from Eden&#x27;s Garden. This one arrived with an issue with the stopper. The oil just poured out. I contacted the company, and a new bottle was immediately sent to replace, free if charges, including shipping. Highly recommend Eden&#x27;s Garden, great oils and great prices.  Plus excellent customer service!</li>
            <li> When I opened the bottle I felt like I was eating the freshest sweetest orange ever! (I smelled the cap as to not overwhelm my nose) it was so delightful! A+</li>
            <li> Not as aromatic as I thought it would be. Or at all</li>
            <li> I ordered a vial of the Sweet Orange Essential Oil from Eden&#x27;s Garden to use in my bath bombs and shower scrub.  I am VERY happy with the aroma.  It smells absolutely heavenly.  The product is just as described and in my opinion is very high quality.  I would recommend Eden&#x27;s Garden to anyone!!</li>
            <li> Smells delicious.  Works well with other scents too.  Imagine peeling an orange and the smell fills the room, that is what is in this magical little bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought this to mix it in with a gallon of unscented massage oil and it worked great! A little goes a long way. Very soft, gentle smell of yummy oranges.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I was completely new to essential oils and chose Edens Garden over the myriad of others because of reviews.  Those good reviews were rightly deserved.  Fast shipping, superbly packaged, and absolutely awesome smells.  Try it.</li>
            <li> I used this product to create non-toxic dryer sheets for my towels. I wanted a quality product that would impart a light scent to my towels. I&#x27;m still in the experimental stages, and so far the results have been good. I appreciate the fact that the product is just as described by the seller and it was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> Whether you&#x27;re putting them in a diffuser or using them for other purposes, they are the best.</li>
            <li> I ordered the sweet orange and lemon oils because the price was right. I just started experimenting with more natural ways to clean my home and didn&#x27;t want to invest too much money on oils until I knew this \\&quot;green thing\\&quot; would work for our busy family. The products arrived quickly and were just as described. The smells were so fresh and natural. I mixed up some cleaning solutions and tried them out while the kids were napping. When my 3 year old got up, she asked where the oranges were and asked for one. It really smelled like I was peeling sweet oranges in the kitchen and I had to let her smell the bottle to convince her there were no fresh oranges. I do agree that the smell didn&#x27;t last all day, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to. I&#x27;ve been hesitant to jump on the all natural bandwagon, but these oils make it fun. I&#x27;m about to order some citronella (for mosquito repellant), peppermint and lavender (for \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot;- my friend tried it and has me convinced it&#x27;s better than store bought shampoo). I&#x27;ll probably add more oils to the collection once I get more \\&quot;recipes\\&quot;. And I appreciated the pamphlet that came with the order: 45 Ways To use Essential Oils. Nice to have handy.</li>
            <li> smells like fresh oranges...a great refreshing scent!</li>
            <li> This has a great smell. So much so that I wish it was a bit more intense. It truly smells like oranges and the scent does last.</li>
            <li> The smell is incredible! ❤️❤️❤️❤️</li>
            <li> This smells so good! I like citrus as it wakens my spirits and imagine. I have a pet dog and it helps cover his odors nicely.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this one, and it&#x27;s not too expensive for me when I buy my oils here</li>
            <li> I like is very good this product thanks.</li>
            <li> I have gotten a bunch of oils from edens organic and they are all awesome!  I use them in an oil burner to make my house smell awesome.  I also mix them with water in a spray bottle to freshen up all kinds of surfaces.  sweet orange is really good mixed with vanilla as well.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing. I got this to put in my homemade body butter and it couldn&#x27;t smell any better. I love this!</li>
            <li> I use Sweet Orange to make my own room freshener! Add this to baking soda for room freshener, or BS and water for spray!</li>
            <li> I use a few drops of this with coconut oil and Oil of Cloves in my Scent Warmer......smells soooo good!</li>
            <li> Not as sweet smelling as I thought but that&#x27;s my issue not the product</li>
            <li> Perfect for adding to homemade lotions</li>
            <li> I am new to essential oils and didn&#x27;t think there was a difference in the brands. So because they were cheaper, I bought many of Eden&#x27;s Garden oils. I thought they were good because I did not know how essential oils should be. Then, I needed a few dollars to get free shipping at the company where I purchase all of my organic herbs. I noticed that they also sold essential oils so I added one to my cart. It was way more expensive than I had paid for the Eden&#x27;s Garden oils. When it arrived, I immediately opened it a smelled it. It smelled just like you would think it would, fresh. then I opened up the Eden&#x27;s Garden and it smelled like chemicals and nothing like the organic one from my herb company. I thought it might just be &amp;#34;me&amp;#34; so I let my husband smell the two brands and without even knowing what the two brand were, he chose the herb company one. He also said that the Eden&#x27;s Garden oil smelled chemically. I thought I was saving money by buying the Eden&#x27;s Garden oils but now I have to replace all of the Eden&#x27;s Garden oils with better ones. Each one that I replace has been the same situation and the Eden&#x27;s Garden oils always have a chemically smell.</li>
            <li> Great scent for soaps and lotions! Absolutely love the products! Have about 20 different oils and have yet to be disappointed! Great prices and fast shipping. Customer service is nice and replies very timely. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I add 2-3 drops to the milk with oatmeal in the morning, a little bit of raw honey, and I have a delicious breakfast. Same thing with the lemon oil. I also use them for baking, and recently I&#x27;ve put a few drops in the cream mixture for my homemade ice-cream, it really gives a terrific flavor to any dish.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Sweet Orange Essential Oil (sold by Eden&#x27;s Garden). This product is highly concentrated, so you only need a few drops. Try putting a drop or two on a few cotton balls, put the cotton balls in a small plastic bag (smaller than a sandwich bag)close it and poke a few holes in the bag.I use this in my clothing drawer, in the corner of my coat closet, etc. Anywhere you would like to smell something delicious!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this product!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered two oils from the company and realized that there was an issue when they arrived (which was probably USPS more than them) and they were so friendly and easy to communicate with, that I will buy essential oils from them from here on out for that reason if nothing else! However , the oils are actually great and seem to be of quality. Price is much better than most stores. I am pleased all the way around :) I have been using these in soaps, bath salts, homemade cleaning concoctions, laundry (My significant other is highly allergic to tide and other fragrance laden soaps, so I was thrilled to find that I can wash our clothes with essential oils such as orange as an additive to give our clothes a great clean smell without breaking him out. Plus, I suggest anyone try washing your sheets with a touch of lavender, a great natural sleep aid).</li>
            <li> met and exceeded my expectations, I use this every day. I Love mixing these different oils. will definitely use again.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of these one</li>
            <li> Fresh and perfect! Love Edens Garden!</li>
            <li> The most amazing oil ever! it already gone. I need to order more.</li>
            <li> works wonderfully as a perfume. it lasts for hours!</li>
            <li> I keep ordering these incenses as they last, and are a good quality incense. They really have a nice smell.</li>
            <li> smells just like orange peels.</li>
            <li> Exactly want I wanted.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I use it in my mist bottle for my hair spray. A couple drops goes a long way and the orange smell is awesome!</li>
            <li> Smells good hadn&#x27;t tried</li>
            <li> I used these to make sugar scrubs as Christmas gifts and everyone loved them. Smells amazing. Great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I use this along with their Jasmine oil, put a few drops in a spray bottle and makes every room (and my car) smell heavenly.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances...the price is great and quick delivery...it smell like real oranges...I wish the fragrance last a little longer..but I definitely recommend it...and will be ordering more...</li>
            <li> I used the essential oil in my \\&quot;homemade\\&quot; laundry detergent.  It gives the clothes a nice fresh smell.  The service I received from the provider was exceptional.  If you enjoy essential oils, you will LOVE this brand.</li>
            <li> Nice smelling product.  Arrived in a timely manner.  Well package and would recommend anyone who is in the hobby of making candles. Scent last a long while. Not over powering.</li>
            <li> Great smelling essential oil!</li>
            <li> Good stuff for the price but you can get better oils</li>
            <li> SWEET ORANGE IS A VERY NICE OIL SENT IT IS NATURAL AROMA AND IT IS REAL ORANGE OIL USEFUL AS ROOM SPRAY  AND AS A ROOM AND CAR FRESHNER</li>
            <li> I started trying the essential oils after getting tired of the same fragrances on body lotions and candles.&lt;br /&gt;As you may imagine I went overboard and bought a lot of oils, lemon, key lime, mandarin, tangerine, clementine and sweet orange. From all of them, sweet orange is the nicest, not too strong and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;It smells more like the orange peel, but yet refined.</li>
            <li> I have 2 dehumidifiers in my home, or what some people may call \\&quot;mist lamps\\&quot;. I put the orange drops in my lamps to give the home a fresh smell. I will also drop orange with lemon (about 6 drops of each into each lamp), everyone who comes over when I do this always asks how I make my home smell so clean, and it is a fresh smell and not the soap aisle clean kind of smell.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this! I use it for so much, but my favorite use is to but a few drops on my wool dryer balls to make my laundry smell fabulous!! It&#x27;s natural, smells great and the price is nice. Shipping was super speedy too! Very impressed and I can&#x27;t wait to buy more scents from the same brand &amp; seller.</li>
            <li> Smells nice. was excatly what i ordered.  kat</li>
            <li> i used it 2 days now and is my favorite smell is not strong or too sweet... is so fragrant my room smelled wonderfully</li>
            <li> Want to use to do lotions and soaps.  Haven&#x27;t used it for that purpose yet. Have enjoyed it in a diffuser.</li>
            <li> Essential oils are so uplifting. I&#x27;m very sensitive to perfumes, so am always looking for different ways to blend essential oils. This smells great with a dab of lavender - or on it&#x27;s own. It also freshens a room nicely!  Oil is very good quality.</li>
            <li> I love all my oils so far this one smells super sweet i add to some water in a spray bottle and sometimes just spray it around the house.</li>
            <li> At first I put excellent ratings, it was my first time purchasing essential oils and to be honest I wasn&#x27;t an expert on them. They smelled nice as I opened the bottle, so I guessed everything was fine. But now that some time has passed and I tried other brands as well, I don&#x27;t think their oils are pure at all. They don&#x27;t seem concentrated at all they only have a faint smell.Nothing like other brands! I put 20 drops of this oil in my diffuser and smelled nothing, while another user said with just a few drops on cotton balls her closet smells heavenly. I thought to try that and give it another chance. Not even the cotton balls smell after a couple of HOURS. Well, either I got a different product or that this is a fake review, and to be honest I think it&#x27;s the latest. I purchased 4 different oils from this company, I&#x27;m not satisfied at ALL with ANY of them. NOT going to be purchasing again with them. I prefer to pay more and get a pure oil than this quality ever again. Beware, I think this company uses fake reviews to sell their products. Purchase with caution. Maybe try one before you buy 4 like me and regret it later on.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Seems pure as stated, hasn&#x27;t lost it&#x27;s scent over time, consistency is liquid good and not thick.&lt;br /&gt;Mix it with heavier cremes and moisturizers to loosen them a bit and it works great for that, too.</li>
            <li> smells great and will be ordering more soon...</li>
            <li> New to essential oils and am trying to learn what is normal and what is not.  This scent does not last very long but while it is discernible, I enjoy it very much.</li>
            <li> Not happy. Didn&#x27;t receive oil as pictured received a different brand. Pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and seems very pure. I&#x27;ll be using it around the house for cleaning and diffusing to freshen the air.</li>
            <li> This sweet orange oil has a very nice smell.It does smell just like oranges. I only wish the smell was a bit more potent.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this! It makes me happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this in the hopes of using it with my Scentsy warmer (I am allergic to the fragrance in their waxes) because I wanted something to make my living room smell good occasionally. It works alright for that purpose, but it takes a lot of oil (10 drops or more) and the scent only lasts for about 30 minutes before it dries up.</li>
            <li> My new favorite! I use it like perfume. And Edens Zgarden is the best best best seller!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this oil! I use it in my DIY face scrubs and it works great! Will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> very nice, edens garden sells good quality essential oils at a reasonable price</li>
            <li> Love this one.  Had to get more.</li>
            <li> I have two favorite oils.  This is one of them.  The smell is so relaxing and lasts for so long.  I love everything about the quality of the oil.  I especially love mixing it with other oils as the orange smell is not overpowering but blends very well.</li>
            <li> This has a nice aroma without being over powering. It can be used for a variety of things. It can be used to freshen the air.</li>
            <li> This is ok but not spectacular! Fragrance is weak in a diffuser ! It&#x27;s slightly better in an oil warmer! For that reason I&#x27;d recommend this but not for a diffuser! Also ok as fragrance in a candle!</li>
            <li> There is nothing to govern essential oils (food grade, therapeutic etc) it all comes down to insurance as to whether it&#x27;s edible or not. This does not say safe for consumption, so don&#x27;t eat it. It&#x27;s a strong smell, I added  a few drops of it to some coconut oil and eucerin lotion and my skin is so soft and it is certainly a mood lifter.</li>
            <li> Nice scent to use in my lotion and other body products.Can always count on Edens Garden to make a good product.</li>
            <li> use  a dab on the pillows of the sofa to bring an uplifting mood into any room. Also used it for potpourri.</li>
            <li> Nice oil, but the orange doesn&#x27;t seem as potent as the others.</li>
            <li> for sure go for it! It has a great smell! Love it! IM using it with candle for a nice aroma in my leaving room and it works great!</li>
            <li> Great product just not enough</li>
            <li> Smells GREAT! Very clean smell. Use it to make the house smell clean.</li>
            <li> What a refreshing product!! Great for summer scents or anytime, it smells so citrusy I luv this oil my friends come over n notice the smell instantly</li>
            <li> I really love all the oils I have bought from Edens Garden so its hard to choose my favorite this one I like to use with my plug in diffuser the scent smells so nice not over powering I also put a few drops on cotton balls and place them in various spots in my house.</li>
            <li> Love the oil. Mir is very nice and very good quality!  Use in my dryer on my dryer balls and it works great!</li>
            <li> Smells like the real fruit!</li>
            <li> Not crazy about it, The aroma is not strong enough the body shop satsuma oil is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I ordered this thinking this was from edens garden and it wasn&#x27;t. It came in a white bottle by mEssentials...so was not happy with this purchase. So beware and be careful when placing your order.</li>
            <li> Love the fresh clean orange scent.  Use it to freshen up a room when cleaning or add to bath water for a relaxing yet energizing scent</li>
            <li> quick arrival, packed well. great smell but doesnt last very long. Must apply again in a day. It is okay.</li>
            <li> This smells great. Sometimes, I put a tiny drop in my coffee. Other times, I use to fragrance up the house. The smell is just lovely.</li>
            <li> smells great!  purchased to make my own reed diffuser at home, mixed with cinnamon oil and it smells so good!</li>
            <li> In a word...Invigorating. This scent promotes a feeling of well being. I was surprised at how authentically orang it smelled. I find that orange scents don&#x27;t always come across well. This one does did without being overpowering. One of my favorite scents. Good seller</li>
            <li> Likey!  Edens Garden has great customer service as well.</li>
            <li> Great product..I bought the 10ml bottle...super-fast shipping...great experience...will buy again!!! Oil great for therapy and very much smells like intense orange peels!!!</li>
            <li> I love all the oils I bought. I bought Sweet Orange and a few others and I love the quality of the oils. I also found it very helpful that they sent me a booklet on the essential oils and their uses, I also got a pamphlet with essential oil remedies. Thank you so much, I am a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Nice pleasantly smelling oil used in my flea control remedies for the dog. Works well to boost your spirits as well. I&#x27;m addicted to these natural oils! There are so many uses!</li>
            <li> Love the aroma of this. Just diagnosed with high BP and am trying to change my stress level. I ordered 5 essential oils from this place and they are amazing. The smell is potent, and they sent both a usage guide and catalog explaining all the oils they have. Super amazing, will certainly be ordering more from them. :) very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This essential oil smells absolutely amazing and can be used for so many different things! I love it and will purchase again in the future!</li>
            <li> I ordered four oils from this company for use in my natural toothpastes and deoderants and other beauty uses. I made some orange peppermint toothpaste from coconut oil and baking soda and the taste of these oils is very refreshing and high quality. I will order again from Edens Garden</li>
            <li> Fantastic smell however only lasts for about 10-15 minutes so it doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> This is extremely nice.  Smells exactly like oranges.  Doesn&#x27;t trigger my respiratory allergies.  Smells nice and fresh and invigorating.  I can&#x27;t wait to use it in the unscented shower gel I bought.  I would definitely recommend this.  I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> Very nice essential oil and it smells really good. Works for what it is suppose to do. Thank you seller! I will be purchasing other products from this selllwr again in the near future.</li>
            <li> I mixed with a carrier oil to use after shower and it smells good.  I also use it my vacuum cleaner bags to freshen the house.</li>
            <li> Good item, good merchant!</li>

            <li> so many useful ways to use this.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to blend with other oils I purchased on Amazon to create a bathroom spray.&lt;br /&gt;I also use a couple of drops of this oil in a bottle filled with water and vinegar which I use to clean counters with and it leaves a nice smell as compared to the vinegar smell.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived on time and I am very please with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this Product! Arrived quickly. Will order again! Thx seller!</li>

            <li> Great article. Come as expected.</li>
            <li> I used this to make brown sugar body scrubs. The orange made the scrubs smell heavenly. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> use as a air fresher w/ lemon, tangerine,grapefruit,lavender or what ever fruit scent you like instead of synethic product.</li>
            <li> Smells divine! I use this to spray on my pillows at night, so fresh &amp; clean. Great product &amp; prices~</li>
            <li> Not thrilled. I think I&#x27;ll stick with my other brand.</li>
            <li> Great aromatherapy oil that works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Smells so beautiful.  I love this. Mixes well too.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous orange scent. I wish everything could smell this true &amp; wonderful! Made me want fresh squeezed OJ :)</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent. Strongly suggest it for use in a diffuser. You will live it. Not too overpowering</li>
            <li> Quality oil for great price!</li>
            <li> Got this to go with slimming Belt  can not use this now I just wasted money that can not use</li>
            <li> Love this scent! Smells so good and is high quality!</li>
            <li> I used this to make Shea butter lotion, but it came with info of its many uses.  It smells very nice, blended well with the mixture and was not overwhelming.  I look forward to trying out the different uses that are recommemned.  I absolutely love the scent!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells sooooo good! It smells like fresh peeled oranges. I only wish the scent lingered longer. But it&#x27;s lovely.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described &amp; looked just like the picture. Shipping was fast as well. I ordered the orange &amp; peppermint vials. Drops of the orange oil were used in my laundry when washing &amp; I used the peppermint on my knee after my reconstructive surgery. I was amazed at how it helped with the pain. A little book was included with the order (no charge) that showed all their different oils with examples of what illnesses they could help alleviate. Very informative.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this. Fresh and clean! Yum. Quick to arrive and we always enjoy Eden&#x27;s oils!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of oranges.</li>
            <li> Very peaceful scent, mixes well with other scents</li>
            <li> The pic shows eden&#x27;s garden product, so when you get it the label will be completely different. It still says 100% oil. It smells like it should, and ive only used it on cleaning solutions and air diffuser...so far so good. Does what its suppose to.</li>
            <li> Good would order again because I liked the prices. Its my a lingering scent but nice.</li>
            <li> Small amount for price. Have found same quality and more product for less money.</li>
            <li> I love this vendor Eternal Essence is fantastic! Every single bottle I have purchased has been wonderful! I would highly recommend any of their products!</li>
            <li> Mixe a few drops of this with bio oil is wonderful..</li>
            <li> Very nice product and price and fast shipping. Would definitely order from this company again!</li>
            <li> This oil smells so wonderful,it&#x27;s refreshing to any area of your house,just a few drops is all you need.Thank You</li>
            <li> I have been ordering/using Edens Gardens for several months now. I have yet to be disappointed with any of them. I had tried the Blood Orange last month, and decided to try the Sweet Orange this time around. While I do like this oil, I most definitely like the Blood Orange MUCH better. The Sweet Orange has more of a light, airy scent to it while the Blood Orange had a deeper scent. This one also doesn&#x27;t seem to linger as long as the Blood Orange, and it definitely smells sweeter (it is Sweet Orange after all!).  :-) I still like this Sweet Orange though and use it as a hand moisturizer (love that I don&#x27;t need to wipe excess oil off; it seeps right into my skin without leaving me oily) and in my conditioner. I probably won&#x27;t get it again - not because I don&#x27;t like it - but because I like the Blood Orange better.</li>
            <li> Love these oils.  Will purchase more!</li>
            <li> love love love this scent, its a true orange-y scent and it smells great in body scrubs, creams and deodorants i make.</li>
            <li> Great quality. I would buy again from this company. I recommend this company over NOW company. I am a therapist and like to use  therapeutic scents. This oil smells strong and lasts long time.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.  I use it in my candle warmer.</li>
            <li> Addicted to Edens Garden oils. Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Love to mix this with the chocolate!</li>
            <li> Nice orange smell. Love it mixed with my home made shea butter, coconut oil, bees wax, aloe skin creme.</li>
            <li> Works well in the diffuser and it works well with my other oils.</li>
            <li> I bought this for soap-making.&lt;br /&gt;It was a good price, saved me a trip out of town to find it, and my soap smells so nice.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this, to use with my products for my business. This scent is amazing!  I mixed it with lemon and grapefruit and received this beautiful citrusy scent! I would recommend this product to anyone that loves citrus products, and don&#x27;t be afraid to mix and match different oils, you might be pleasantly surprised...</li>
            <li> I have purchased from this vendor previously, always prompt quality oils. Oils are concentrated and last a long time. We use the oils in bathrooms, kitchen, etc. Pleasant, non invasive scent.</li>
            <li> i smells like orange i don&#x27;t know what else to say....it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as theraputic as others but if you wnat your house to smell of oranges get it...</li>
            <li> smells great, good quality</li>
            <li> Bought to use in homemade face oil for my oily, acne prone skin (sweet orange oil is an astringent). I make this about 10% of my grapeseed-lavender-tea-tree blend and it makes everything blend in smoothly and silkily instead of sitting on top of my skin and looking shiny.  Great quality, smells amazing.</li>
            <li> smells great and many uses, I use for many things one of my favorites is adding to a cloth when I steam clean the floor, it makes the house smell wonderful. I also have blended with other oils for different uses. love this</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragrance I use mine for homemade creams and deodorants...</li>
            <li> I cannot help but to smile whenever I inhale this aroma. It&#x27;s such a happy scent; a definite mood lifter. I put 4 drops of this and 3 drops of the Eden&#x27;s Garden Peppermint Essential Oil on a pinecone and set it down in my bedroom. Love it.</li>
            <li> I will be using this for my homemade cleaners, along with the lemon essential oil that I ordered off of Amazon too.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the Sweet Orange essential oil and I love it! The smell is wonderful. A little goes a long way. Purchasing from Edens Garden was great. My order was shipped out the next day after ordering and the shipping was fast. Definitely will order from them again!</li>
            <li> Edens Garden does it again.  Quick and easy order with fast shipping.  A+</li>
            <li> Excellent oil that is very versatile!  Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Early morning freshness</li>
            <li> I love the smell of oranges. I was raised in a county full of oranges. I distinctly remember the smell, of the blossoms, as I delivered my newspapers in the morning as a kid. To me this smells more like Valencia Oranges not Navels. I have been enjoying this new smell in my home as I walk around. Good Luck !</li>
            <li> I purchased this to add a fragrance to some lip balm I was making.  It worked out perfectly, was received as promised.</li>
            <li> Very good stuff. I use it to make laundry soap. Delightful scent.,</li>
            <li> love the scent I use everyday</li>
            <li> scent is definitly there</li>
            <li> The scent is great and very orange. I just discovered it&#x27;s not my favorite scent, but if you like the smell of oranges, this is for you.</li>
            <li> Very nice scent. I made some wool hand warmers and scented with this orange and cinnamon. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this company!! Superb oils and excellent prices! I use these in my massage oils, lotions &amp; creams. I also use them in making homemade bath &amp; body products. I will continue to order this brand, it has quickly become a favorite!!</li>
            <li> I love love love this oil, it&#x27;s my favorite by far. I&#x27;m a citrus girl, and I put this in everything I can (homemade cleansers, DIY beauty, everywhere). It&#x27;s sweet but not in a sickly, overpowering way. Very happy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a southern girl and love citrus smells. Orange and lemon smells remind me of the fruit trees we had in the yard growing up. Even now as an adult I love walking out my door and smelling the neighbors orange trees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I had did the whole scentsy thing, ordering the blocks and whatnot to fragrance my home. But after a while the smell would last long. I got on amazon and decided to see what oils where out there to try. I found edens garden and have been in love since lol. I LOVE their products!!  I use the peppermint oil and breathe easy oils when I&#x27;m congested and it does wonders. Plus makes my house smell good. I adore the orange and lemon of course. I have baby food jars I have cleaned out. I put a little baking soda and then about 10 drops of whichever oil I want. I make a few holes in the lids and place them in closets and my bathroom. It makes my house smell wonderful and clean(but not disinfectant clean lol).  With the cinnamon oil I usually put a drop on the inside of the toilet paper roll. So anytime the toilet paper is used you get a fresh wiff of cinnamon. I will eventually try many more of the scents. I usually order my favorites and add a new one in to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These guys are awesome. Their products are good and shipping is fast. Within 5 days of ordering I was surprised to check the mail and see my order had come in. Fast shipping an great products, ill be a customer for life!</li>
            <li> This orange is one of my favorites...I will be buying more...I went right to the company and purchased more and shipping was free because I bought quite a lot.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Does not take a lot for the smell to come through since it is so strong!</li>
            <li> not my favorite brand</li>
            <li> This is a great essential oil. I was not sure what to expect from this company, but I love their products. Out of the three oils that I purchased (lemon, sweet orange, and melaleuca), this oil was my second-favorite. It has a wonderful scent, just like a ripe orange, even though I purchased it almost a year ago. Though the bottle seems small, it holds a lot of oil. Since the oil is potent and only used a few drops at a time, a little bottle will last me quite a long while.&lt;br /&gt;I like to use this oil on acne as a spot- treatment. It works well to clear my face. I have also scented my bathwater with it. It creates a lovely and uplifting scent. Of course, I have to be careful when using it as citrus can burn. One of my favorite uses of it is in a toner water made with lemon, sweet orange, and tea tree oils. This toner is wonderful on my acne-prone face and it is alcohol-free. Eventually, I want to purchase an essential oil diffuser and diffuse this happy scent throughout my room.&lt;br /&gt;I can buy from Eden&#x27;s Garden with confidence, knowing that their EOs are of good quality, quantity, and have so many uses.&lt;br /&gt;Attached is a picture of the three oils I have purchased with a tape measure for scale.</li>
            <li> really like this, also has many uses.</li>
            <li> Smells SO good!! I just got this in the mail today, and it shipped rather quickly! They also made sure to wrap it carefully so usps didn&#x27;t break the glass bottles. So far, i am loving the smell! I plan to use it in the morning to help me wake up refreshed, ready to start the day. Hopefully it helps! I&#x27;m a college student, so sleep is difficult at times, which makes for long days! So happy to find a company like yours with good quality, for good prices. :D</li>
            <li> I purchased several of these oils and found them to be a product of quality.  Very strong odor and it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use to scent some homemade body care products. It works great in my homemade deodorant and body spray. Such a pleasing aroma, sweet without being sickening.</li>
            <li> One of the most amazing smells and will bring you sweet dreams and leave your brain on a comfort level which allows you to sleep</li>
            <li> This smells so good, it makes me want to eat it.  I love putting it in a pot of boiling water to make my home smell like one nice sweet orange that just got peeled and is ready to be eaten.  I like the multiples uses for combatting colds and lifting the energy in the home as citrus typically does along with that just cleaned smell.</li>
            <li> love the scent its strong and last a good while. used it in my homemade foot scrub will be buying more sents</li>
            <li> I love the smell of oranges so was thrilled to get this it&#x27;s a winner with me  will be using this as a room freshener. The company I had never heard of until now and it&#x27;s now going to be  one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I love this oil!  I used it to make sugar scrubs for Christmas presents.  I will also be using it for soap making.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t last as long as i&#x27;d like but the scent is too amazing not to give it 5 stars</li>
            <li> I love this sweet orange oil.  It arrived in good time and well packaged so it would not break.  I put a little in an oil burner and it just filled the house with the scent.  Other brands of oils I have ordered have had either strange scents and did not smell like they should have or the scent was barely there but thankfully that does not hold true for this oil.  I will be ordering some more.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I ordered this orange oil because it said it was from Eden&#x27;s Garden, but when I received it ..it was Orange oil from MEssentials. Very disappointed because I love Eden&#x27;s Garden essential oils.</li>
            <li> I love using this oil, in my oil burner just dilute it with a little water, the house smells fresh, clean, and a wonderful citrus scent, not to strong, and not to weak, just perfect, will continue to keep buying this oil..</li>
            <li> YOU WILL LOVE THIS&lt;br /&gt;amazing orange smell&lt;br /&gt;pleasant and everyone in my house loves it. i highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought the Sweet Orange Essential Oil along with several other scents to use in my oil warmer. I absolutely love it! I use just a few drops with water and place a small candle underneath. The fragrance is heavenly and I highly recommend this product. I&#x27;m glad I bought several bottles, I had a feeling I&#x27;m gonna like it!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Orange, Lemon, and Lavender for my wife&#x27;s birthday and, then, as an afterthought, got the combination \\&quot;6-pack\\&quot; of therapeutic oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The orange, lemon, and lavender are are bargain for the scents. They definitely carry on the memory of the lemon and orange trees we have in our back patio that were in bloom for such a short time just last month. My wife loves them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combination box, however, was almost an overpowering array of mixtures of scents that should not be combined, not ever. But, loving the lemon and orange in particular, my wife made a request for cinnamon (for the kitchen primarily) and gardenia. And then, we&#x27;ll call our experimentation over, and will not be combining anything anymore. And, there will be no candles, flames, or anything hot near something called \\&quot;oil.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY recommended for someone special, i.e., someone whose tastes you know. If they&#x27;re going to get ME as a buyer outside of the gift giving, I want a new car smell of plastic and leather. That&#x27;s a combo and it doesn&#x27;t need flame!</li>
            <li> Quick Delivery. This smells true to Orange Oil, however the fragrance just does not last as long as I would like it too.</li>
            <li> Perfect, just as described.  A perfect addition to make my homemade lip balm smell delightful!</li>
            <li> Love the oil. Great for candle and soap making, or a dab behind the ears and on your wrists!</li>
            <li> The price was amazing. It met my expectations. I would recommend this product to any one who is into essential oils, Thank you.</li>
            <li> I moisturize my skin and hair with olive oil, and I use a few drops of this sweet orange oil mixed with it to give it a pleasing fragrance. It makes me smell like oranges!</li>
            <li> Smell nice and a fracrion of the price of other citrus oils. I add it to homemade cleaning products.</li>
            <li> Change the taste of food</li>
            <li> I have just started using essential oils for making my own household cleaners.  Will be purchasing more to buy up a variety of scents.</li>
            <li> I was hopping for stronger...and long lasting smell - I even got two bottles - I love when the house smells good, but this - it smells for a few minutes and then you need to keep adding more and more drops. In my opinion, people have not tried better products if they give such amazing reviews to this item.</li>
            <li> Did not like this product.has no smell. I accidentally spilled half the bottle and one would think there would be an orange aroma. There wasn&#x27;t. I do not thing these are high quality oils.</li>
            <li> This is my FAVORITE scent from Edens Garden. It smells just like an orange peel. I use it in my diffuser with their lemon and lime scent, which makes my apartment smell like citrus. It&#x27;s awesome :D</li>
            <li> Beyond impressed with this company!! My package arrived with product guides and pamphlets. Very professional I was greatly impressed!!</li>
            <li> Will have this in my home forever.</li>
            <li> Smells Great!!!! This is the only fragrance out of the four I bought that I really liked. I used it to make Bath Bombs and Bath Salts. Even my husband likes them.</li>
            <li> this stuff smells gooooooooood</li>
            <li> Have not had time to use yet but smells wonderful am looking forward to enjoying it.</li>
            <li> smells great if you like oranges you&#x27;ll love this product, you can put a two or three drops in your bath and it smells a whole bathroom like oranges I love that</li>
            <li> I purchased this orange oil to add to homemade products.  So far I&#x27;ve used it in dryer sheets.  I love the smell.  I&#x27;ve purchased several other oils from Eden&#x27;s Garden and I&#x27;m very satisfied with all of them, good price too.</li>
            <li> Smells NOTHING like orange blossoms... doesn&#x27;t really even smell like oranges.</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of orange smell works well when making your own cleaning product.</li>
            <li> I ordered Sweet Orange, Clove, Tea Tree and Bergamot oils. I am very pleased with the quality and their scent. I recently put together a batch of body butter with shea butter, coconut oil and added sweet orange and bergamot oils. It is one of my favorite scent combinations so far. I will order more oils from this seller!</li>
            <li> I perhaps should have researched more-- my plan for use was too simplistic/not sensible-- or maybe I should have gone with different types/more expensive oils.  Not sure-- no longer going to attempt mixing oil scents for personal use-- My Bad.</li>
            <li> I have gone through two bottles of sweet orange. Great for everything. I use it in cleaning supplies, aromatherapy and homemade body products. The smell is powerful and beautiful. I cannot get enough of it.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t quite as strong as I was hoping for. However, it did smell wonderful. I just wish it had been a tad stronger. I don&#x27;t know if maybe I just got an old bottle or if sweet orange isn&#x27;t very potent in general.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite! I love the smell that this has. Cant help but smile when I sniff it. lol Really happy oil!</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product. I love, love the scent. real orange. I would recommend this to everyone who wants to live a healthy lifestyle with all natural products.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites.  I use a lot.  Thank you!  LOVE it!</li>
            <li> smells just like orange peal, great company</li>
            <li> This oil has a sweet orange scent similar to an orange creme popsicle. I had some questions about shipping and got a response from the company within the same day! I am very happy with this oil and with this company.</li>
            <li> good product but need better pricing</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this smell.  Upon opening I immediately  soaked some cotton balls and placed around my home.  OMG, the smell is fantastic..  My house smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have purchased this product. Very nice, not too thin. Very strong, pleasant aroma. Plan on buying more from this company!</li>
            <li> Nice smell! I use this oil when making soaps.</li>
            <li> Love the smell! Great for soap! Body butter too!</li>
            <li> works ok, but smell was very subtle and I was using it for the smell</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!! I have been very happy with all of the oils I&#x27;ve bought from Edens Garden. They work just as well as DoTerra, but way more affordable.</li>
            <li> well packaged - prompt delivery - item as described - would recommend</li>
            <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living. I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM. Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers. We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price. The reason it is a fraction of the price is because it does not have about 3 to 5 levels of compensations for its representatives built into the margins, which drastically reduces the overhead. That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden. From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden. If you are one of the 1 - 5% making great money with an MLM, more power to you! But for everyone else, this oil matches up well with the best of them.</li>
            <li> Great for aromatherapy &amp; homemade skin care.</li>
            <li> Smells great but a little does not go a long way. A lot goes a little way. If it says use 1 drop then use 10. Especially for candles but all in all a good inexpensive product.</li>
            <li> This is a nice scent, yes it&#x27;s sweet orange but not too sweet. It&#x27;s scent is fresh and true. I&#x27;ve bought alot of scents by this company and they were all true and not too sweet or weak like i found with other brands. This is good stuff, look no further!</li>
            <li> Product as described. Arrived promptly, would buy again</li>
            <li> The sweet fragrance of this oil is just heavenly. I added it to some Shea butter and its fragrance completely overshadowed that of the shea butter.</li>
            <li> So I ordered this with the intention of making lotion, or candles with this scent. I got it today, after having placed the order only a couple of days ago. I absolutely love it! When I smelled it, I thought I was smelling a fresh orange...but sweeter. If you like fruity or sweet scents, definitely try this one. I can&#x27;t wait to make my first \\&quot;batch\\&quot; of lotion.</li>
            <li> hello. I hope this finds everyone well. That&#x27;s product came on time. it was exactly what they described. I will be ordering from these folks again. they have a whole product line of essential oils.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to make bath bombs and bath salts with and it is the perfect fragrant product i have found to date. Wonderful flavor without having to use very much of it to get the product smelling great. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this Sweet Orange Oil !!! Smells like a fresh cut orange. Smells great by itself or mixed with other oil scents. I&#x27;ve gotten other oils from this company, and I love them all. They ship quickly, and I&#x27;m very happy. I recommend this company.</li>
            <li> The aroma is incredible the cent is true to the sweet orange, very rejuvenated , it&#x27;s a fresh wake up oil, love it</li>
            <li> I used this product in a home remedy cellulite reducer.  Smells okay but wish I would have purchased the lemon.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use for homemade cleaning supplies. I love the smell of orange, and you can definitely tell this is sweet orange, it isn&#x27;t quite as strong of a citrus scent as you might except but it still smells great.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this oil! I will definitely be back to order more essential oils from Eden Gardens!!</li>
            <li> This oil is perfect and it&#x27;s definitely my favorite of the Eden&#x27;s Garden oils I have so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very crisp and sweet, like a freshly peeled orange and I love my house smelling like it after I clean instead of smelling like my vinegar cleaner. Vinegar with food is one thing, but I hate smelling it all day; I just smell raunchy instead of cleanliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sweet orange oil is one you should buy in the largest quantity possible. A little goes a very long way, but it smells so delicious that you&#x27;ll use it for everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I love putting it in the diffuser. Maybe it&#x27;s in my head, but I really feel like it helps my very active and easily distracted two year old to focus.</li>
            <li> Edens Garden Sweet Orange essential oil is one of our favorites!  My daughter adds a few drops to the final rinse water when washing her hair.  We also enjoy adding it to our humidifier in winter as it adds a soothing aroma to the air.  This can be done with any of Edens Gardens oils!  Our horses love the fragrance of Sweet Orange, so we let them inhale the aroma straight from the bottle!  We sometimes add Sweet Orange to a carrier oil to use when massaging the horses or ourselves!  I buy all my essential oils from Edens Garden.  They are of the highest quality, the shipping is fast, and the customer service is excellent.  This is one of my favorite companies!</li>
            <li> Well worth the money. The smell is nice and my place smells like sweet oranges right now. Wish their sandalwood was this good.</li>
            <li> This is the first poor review I have given, and I am the only person to have done so. I think the quality of this oil is really poor. I was really excited as I had bought a diffuser, and I bought different oils to use in it. The two I bought from this company are really inadequate when it comes to aromatherapy, I believe. I am supposed to put up to 10 drops of oil into the diffuser. With this I can smell nothing. I tried 20 drops of this orange combined with the eucalyptus. I smelled nothing. I mean come on it is Eucalyptus I am talking about here. How can you not smell that.&lt;br /&gt;  I bought Veriditas Botanicals&#x27; organic \\&quot;immunity boost\\&quot;, Wyndmere&#x27;s \\&quot;Joyful Spirit,\\&quot; and I recieved aethereo&#x27;s \\&quot;niaouli melablend\\&quot; with my diffuser. All of these oils have good strong aroma&#x27;s. They are also a lot more expensive. Wyndmere is organic even though for some strange reason they choose not to disclose this. A reviewer commented on the fact that these Eden Garden&#x27;s oil are tiny bottles for the money. They are cheap. They are very cheap. I would much prefer to spend 3/4 times the money and get the smells I desire. All I can think is that these oils must be adequate in other ways, like putting on a tissue and smelling etc, but for my diffuser they are inadequate. I am going to throw them out.</li>
            <li> came on time. smells great. works well in candle wax. and in warmers.</li>
            <li> It seemed of good quality, my sister was using it for a cellulite treatment. She even foolishly was putting it on without dilution, it didn&#x27;t do any harm that I can tell. I see no reason not to give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality and smelled so good in the foot soak and sugar scrub I made.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for three months now and I put it in my hair oil to make it smell better. I can say I am in love with it and it always gives my hair a lovely light scent.&lt;br /&gt;I really prefer this to vanilla essential oil</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful orange scent.  I am using it to &#x27;sniff&#x27; the cortisol levels down in the morning.  I am dealing with grief and I am hoping it will help with that also. I bought a bottle for my daughter so that her girls can &#x27;sniff&#x27; and be calmed.  I am looking forward to trying other scents from Edens Garden.  Nice product.</li>
            <li> I have purchased quite a few different oils from Eden&#x27;s Garden before. I have always been pleased and I love receiving the tips sheet on different uses for the oils as well as the beautiful catalog which also explains uses for these essential oils. Tonight I am using an oil burner to try out &amp;#34;Sweet Orange&amp;#34; A bright citrus aroma, uplifting and warm. I have only dropped a few drops into a bit of water on my warmer and no other scents were added. Not too sweet, strong, not too weak, etc. I am excited to see what other oils I may mix this one with and come up with other creative scents on my own. Would definitely recommend to my friends. In fact, this scent reminds me of my yoga class that I attend up to four times per week. At the conclusion of our class as we bring our souls back into the present, our instructor stretches each student&#x27;s shoulders/neck/ other areas with a similar Sweet Orange scented lotion and yum.....it is ever heavenly!!!! :) :) :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eden&#x27;s Garden always provides smooth and excellent service. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Very good thanks five star</li>
            <li> wonderful, ess oil worked on everything i have used it for body butter, room spray, cleaning products wonderful smell love it</li>
            <li> I was not a big fan of this scent.</li>
            <li> great oil fast delivery</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite. It made me want an orange, ive made laundry booster crystals,homemade dryer sheets and homemade fabreeze with it. Its by far the best smelling orange oil ive gotten.</li>
            <li> Great smell bottles water and boil on stove and your house smells great. Don&#x27;t waste your Monet on Warner&#x27;s though pot water and this oil works great</li>
            <li> This orange smell is great! It isn&#x27;t as strong as I was hoping for, I am sure just a regular orange one would be, but it is nice and sweet smelling!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping  and it smells great! Not as strong as I&#x27;d like for it to be, so I just use a bit more.</li>
            <li> I use this oil in homemade dish washing liquid and in homemade toothpaste, etc. It is exactly as it was advertised. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> this fragrance will be good for air freshner.  i was hoping for use as body oil. but still good.  good deal with vender still</li>
            <li> Great product every time I order it!</li>
            <li> True essential orange oil has more of a purpose than for scentsty burners and food.  Oils shouldn&#x27;t even be put into a scentsy burner of any kind! An orange oil is for energy your immune system. So put it into your tea, diffuse it into a room(cool diffuser) or put a drop onto your skin and let it do its work!:)</li>
            <li> thanks, I love to diffuse this,,,smells so good,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem with Edens Garden&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always trust Eden Garden!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank s</li>
            <li> I love Edens Gardens oils...all of them.  We have bought lavender and frankincense and muscle relief too.  We both use them every night.&lt;br /&gt;We diffuse 4 Thieves and so far this winter we haven&#x27;t even been sick.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a very refreshing oil.  The sweetness of the orange smell is wonderful.  I use this one because it seems to give me a little more energy plus it reminds me of summertime</li>
            <li> I love the sweet, natural scent of this product.  I also found I only need to use a few drops to get a sensational, long lasting scent!</li>
            <li> quick shipping, product as described</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing, and the scent is strong. It&#x27;s great for adding to scentsy burners. It&#x27;ll make your entire house smell like oranges!</li>
            <li> I love it. It&#x27;s stronger than I thought it would be but totally smells like oranges. I can&#x27;t wait to try it first hand. I like putting essential oils in my hair :)</li>
            <li> wish the oil lasted longer on my burner plate.i have to refill it after about 30 mins some of my other oils burn slower</li>
            <li> This oil smells amazing and I love it to make my own household cleaners.  Sells so fresh and clean.  Much much better than store bought junk with nasty chemicals.</li>
            <li> Fairly priced, came much much quicker than expected, and smells DIVINE!!! I&#x27;ll be buying all my future essential oils from this company in the future!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing especially in my now foods diffuser. I love to mix it with lemon and the stress relief blend.</li>
            <li> use it in a diffuser at home, as opposed to candles and plug ins</li>
            <li> Wonderful! The same as DoTerra!</li>
            <li> Not strange enough of a smell.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing. Got it on time too.</li>
            <li> One of my faves.  I&#x27;ve bought about 14 bottles from EG... all different.  This is in the top 3.  Excited to see all the ways i can use it... because I just love the smell.  Simple.. sweet citrus.  Yum... if you like citrus.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed.  Great oil</li>
            <li> It is simply pure n wonderful!!!</li>
            <li> Great quailty oil, great price</li>
            <li> Scent lasted two days.</li>
            <li> I especially loved the freshness and speedy arrival of the orange oil.  I have found a number of uses for the orange and  a drop or two on the vacuum filter will work to freshen your room while vacuuming and last a couple of weeks.  I love the naturalness of it.  fresh fragrance with no propellants to harm the lungs.  I also use the orange in my liquid soap and body cream.</li>
            <li> Smells exactly like fresh oranges! I love it so much!</li>
            <li> the bomb!!!  My house smells wonderful</li>
            <li> WOW- Top quality oils- made a room spray with water and hours later still can smell. I ordered several bottles of different oil and they included an awesome booklet with all their scents with description and a 101 uses for essential oils pamphlet... awesome! I recommend this company and their products!</li>
            <li> Smells great but the smell doesn&#x27;t last long when I wipe furniture down with it. I put a few drops in my hot bath &amp; had room smelling good.</li>
            <li> The oil took 3 days total to arrive, the sweet smell was immediately noticeable when I opened the package. Really does smell like sweet orange peels &amp;#60;3 ... Jus wish the smell lingered longer, it needs to be re-applied after a couple or few hours</li>
            <li> Very pleasant aroma!  Was not very lasting, but I did not use a carrier oil when applying it. Also the bottle lasted much longer then I anticipated. Over all I am very very pleased with this product and will order again, and I will most likely try other EO&#x27;s from this company.</li>
            <li> Wonderful smelling stuff.  I use it mostly to scent my laundry detergent.</li>
            <li> By me make my hair line, it need to smell good and with this product it able me to do just that.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite essential oil, but it worked for the purpose I bought it for. It did leak into the box a bit during shipping.</li>
            <li> Was very weak smelt like it was losing shelf life didn&#x27;t stink or anything just very weak</li>
            <li> This oil is great to add to your regular hair oil for stimulating your scalp. I wear my hair natural and this oil is great keeping my scalp nourished. A must have!!</li>
            <li> Great for your skin. I use it on my face everyday.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent price.</li>
            <li> I am using this as a perfume along with the bergamot and grapefruit. They all are very strong and smell wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit put off by the Biblical references that came in a pamphlet about how to use the oil, and I&#x27;m not even sure it&#x27;s supposed to be used as perfume though I was searching for that when these came up. Anyway, it&#x27;s natural and can be ingested, so I doubt it&#x27;s a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this five stars because it does exactly what it is supposed to do and smells great. Also it arrived in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this smell. It&#x27;s very potent, the only thing I&#x27;d change would be my order....I should have gotten a larger bottle. I can&#x27;t wait to try other oils.&lt;br /&gt;Ohhh I use mine to add a scent to my floor cleaning soloution (vinegar+water+sweet orange) it works well.</li>
            <li> works very well when making homemade cleaning products. helps take away the gross vinegar smell. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use in my soap making and it smells soooo good and it was not a sickening smell. It was quite natural. Also, since I put it in my homemade soap, the aroma releases even more when you take a shower with hot/warm water!!</li>
            <li> Great aroma and excellent quality essential oil. Using it in my homemade beauty products.</li>
            <li> I bought this Essential Oil to add to my exfoliating salt scrub and it smells wonderful. It is a nice fresh scent to brighten up my day.</li>
            <li> Nice scent. I put it in a diffuser</li>
            <li> this has a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> Organic orange 100% Therapeutic oil disappointment me,  Smelled great for maybe thirty minutes and then the smell was gone.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Is not too sure about the advertised 100% purity of this item. The smell did not seem very natural.</li>
            <li> The orange smells so great.</li>
            <li> I have ordered several different oils at different times they provide a very good fast service and I love the oils</li>
            <li> smells awesome. Edens Garden supplies excellent products</li>
            <li> As described. Fast ship. Would use again.</li>
            <li> Smells really good and smells awesome in blends</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and I love it! I cannot wait to use it on DIY household cleaning supplies around the house.</li>
            <li> I love the Sweet Orange oil. This is a great company to buy from.</li>
            <li> wonderful aroma.  I really like this eo</li>
            <li> Quality of product is good.  Drops are infrequent.  Purchased several from this brand and have the same problem with all of the bottles.  So you are pouring at times and cannot control the amount added.  Worth the price.</li>
            <li> The fluid burns quickly, not as effective as other brands available in the market.</li>
            <li> Great. Just what I wanted</li>
            <li> The sweet orange oil is very nice. It reminds me of a freshly zested sweet orange. Very nice. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Great quality and fat service...</li>
            <li> Great product, and quality.</li>
            <li> i choose this high rating, because this is a product i would reorder again.this product has the scent of fresh oranges.and i use this in my skincare products, if my  costermers like it, so do i.( personally i use this sweet orange oil in my skincare products), love love love.and belive me, im a hard one to please, but this product meets all what i demanded from this product.</li>
            <li> Good value for your money thanks!</li>
            <li> I use this as part of a &#x27;home cleaning recipe&#x27;. Eden&#x27;s Garden are by far one of the cheapest places that sell this product and it&#x27;s every bit as good as the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Great oils!  I think their potency is just as good as the higher priced oils!</li>
            <li> smell like oranges but not like super strong I use it in my diy hair and skin products</li>
            <li> delicious , yummy scent</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough nice things about this company. The prices are great, the shipping is fast and the product is top quality. This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered from them. I will continue to do so in the future. This is the first time I&#x27;ve gotten the orange and it&#x27;s wonderful. I put it in a small spray bottle with water and I have a lovely air freshener. I&#x27;m so tired of smelling canned aerosols that smell like fake food. I also have the lemongrass and lavender. This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered the lemongrass. I put it on a washcloth and hang it in my closet and my clothes never smell musty.  I could have spent twice as much on oils at the health food store and who can beat $2.99 shipping? Love.</li>
            <li> Smells very good! Only a few drops and it fills the room with a great scent or oranges.</li>
            <li> Delivered Quickly! Well Packaged.Great Seller !!&lt;br /&gt;Essential oils for homemade items!! Excellent quality!!</li>
            <li> I have bought from this company many times. Very satisfied with the product, shipped quickly and on time, price is perfect. I run these a lot and the aroma is what is to be expected. When my grand son comes over and has a sniffle, cough, or runny nose I combine some of these based on his symptoms and run it in my diffusor and he is fine all night. Would and have been buying again.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I needed and at a good price.</li>
            <li> I was not sure what to expect when I ordered this product. I read the reviews before I bought it just to make sure I was getting something good. I needed a scent that I could use in some of my homemade products and this works just great. I love the smell. It&#x27;s just like real oranges. The downside is how tiny it is for the price. I will need bigger bottles of oils for my homemade poducts and will not be purchashing this again.</li>
            <li> I recently used this product to make my own hand foaming soap.  The orange oil give the soap a sweet, fresh scent that lightly lingers on your hands after washing them.  I can&#x27;t wait to try more home crafts (lotions, cleaners, etc.) with this product.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s good stuff, it&#x27;s about a third of an ounce and the recipe I used called for 1 1/2 oz. I found some 4 oz. bottles.</li>
            <li> I love essential oils. This is a great company selling quality oils at low prices. The orange is sweet and strong. I highly recommend. Definitely check out the breathe easier blend. It is amazing in that is works!</li>
            <li> The oil smells exactly as described citrus and sweet. Not strong as expected. I put a couple drops on a cotton ball and put it under the pillow.</li>
            <li> The scents are very nice at first but after about a week of having opened them they lose most of there power.  I kept the bottles closed and even have tried shaking them thinking the scent might have seperated out but it has not helped regain the scent. The first week I only had to use a few drops but after a month i have to put about 15 in.  I do not use them very often either so it should not be because of desensitation to the scents.</li>
            <li> Love Eden&#x27;s garden essential oils. Great quality at a very reasonable price. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> i used this oil as a scent to my homemade hair products &amp; it&#x27;s very pleasant. it isn&#x27;t overwhelming either.</li>
            <li> Bought this and many other oils for the wife.  I am thoroughly impressed with the quality of Edens Gardens Essential Oils.  They seem to utilize excellent extraction procedures as well as quality control in the manufacture of their products.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend to anyone interested in essential oils.</li>
            <li> This smells just like fresh cut oranges. I put it in my homemade cleaning solution and the whole house smells clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> Love the scent in my products.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely amazing,  the quality is top notch.  I use this in my oil burner and my entire house smells clean.  Love this oil</li>
