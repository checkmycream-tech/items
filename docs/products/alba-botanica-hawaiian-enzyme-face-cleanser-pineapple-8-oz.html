            <li>anymore!&lt;br /&gt;It has a pleasant fragrance too.  </li>
            <li>Maybe good for someone with oily skin</li>

            <li>Every time I attempted to switch thinking it would be good for my skin, it would backfire and I would realize how good</li>
            <li>This cleanser has a surprisingly cooling effect on the skin.</li>

            <li>also, it is good for cleansing make up.  </li>
            <li>Smells really good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not always easy to find cruelty-free products (ie: Leaping Bunny certified) in a store like Duane Reade or CVS, so when I came across this and really liked the results, I was very happy that they did not test on animals.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells nice, and my face feels good after using it.</li>

            <li>Luckily, this cleanser works so well and now that my skin feels so good, I don&#x27;t want to touch my face anymore!</li>
            <li>Smells kind of like rubber.</li>
            <li>Nice suds.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably use it for shaving when summer rolls around again as it&#x27;s nice and thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This face wash is so nice</li>
            <li>so I know it&#x27;s not stripping my own</li>
            <li>and I liked the price Amazon had.</li>

            <li>I have a nice moisturizer that I use after the shower and I&#x27;m fine all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Halfway through splashing my face with water to rinse the cleanser off, I opened my eyes to see the areas that needed more rinsing.  </li>
            <li>and I prefer a cleanser that I can use safely around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and feel of this cleanser.</li>
            <li>SunKissALba on YouTube recommended these products and I am satisfied with the results.</li>

            <li>I really love about this product</li>
            <li>So when I got home, that night, I used it and fell in love.</li>
            <li>pineapple smell is great and it lathers up without using much.</li>
            <li>It feels refreshing.</li>
            <li>I love Alba.</li>
            <li>My Clinique works better for my skin.</li>
            <li>Here are some notes on why I love it so:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>Feel free to ask me any questions!</li>
            <li>love the smell and the freshness.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m already a fan of alba products and i&#x27;m sure i will repurchase this one.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, and it cleans my Mac foundation off way better than Cetaphil.</li>
            <li>The price was much better than at the grocery store.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin so this is a good thing!</li>
            <li>It lathers up quickly and effectively washed my face</li>
            <li>The price is a huge incentive too &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light but very effective at removing my makeup (I wear Bare Minerals).</li>
            <li>It smells like a tropical paradise (if you like pineapple like we do) and lathers easily.</li>
            <li>Makeup dissolves easily (including eye).  </li>
            <li>I follow up with a toner and moisturizer and it makes my routine easy.  </li>
            <li>The ergonomics of the bottle/ pump are really easy to use in the shower or at a sink&lt;br /&gt;9.</li>
            <li>I love that this cleanser is not cream based and leaves my face feeling fresh and light.</li>
            <li>This is a great facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>My makeup wouldn&#x27;t even apply smoothly.</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive this product</li>
            <li>this stuff smells great, doesnt over dry your face and cleans well.</li>
            <li>My skin feels clean, even from sunscreen after use</li>
            <li>and this is by far THE BEST facial cleanser</li>
            <li>It thoroughly cleans my face, has pure ingredients, is a very fair price for the product and how long it lasts.</li>
            <li>I was looking for an organic, not tested on animals cleanser that would do as good a job as the regular stuff.</li>
            <li>and although I really liked it, it did nothing for my adult acne or flakey skin.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and how gentle this is on my face.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend! :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Phisoderm, Neutrogena, Oil of Olay and many others, but they don&#x27;t take off my makeup very well.  </li>
            <li>Just fresh, clean skin.</li>
            <li>Skin feels clean and fresh with no soapy or residue feel.</li>
            <li>:)) from high end to drug store</li>
            <li>Very nice cleanser, leaves face feeling soft, not dry.</li>
            <li>The pineapple enzymes do a great job of shrinking pores and sloughing off dead skin.</li>
            <li>Their Pineapple Enzyme Facial mask is also AMAZING and part my weekly routine, I always get compliments on my glowing skin after I use</li>
            <li>Glad it&#x27;s not making me break out since I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>cleanser is clear, with a fantastic scent, that works up into a rich lather.</li>
            <li>Mild and gentle formula.</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin that will breakout easily and gets oily in the T-zone and this works well for me.</li>
            <li>and it leaves my face feeling clean, fresh and soft...</li>
            <li>I opened my eyes once again to make sure I had removed all the cleanser, especially around my hairline.  </li>
            <li>This one was sold at a better price this last time.</li>
            <li>This cleanser really helps control my breakouts and clogged pores, I RARELY breakout anymore-</li>
            <li>but it was priced much higher then what I wanted to pay</li>
            <li>I use this cleanser with the Green Tea Oil Free facial moisturizer (same brand/ line) and it is the PERFECT combo for combination skin.  </li>
            <li>So much so that I went as far as emailing Alba on their site to inform them of this because it seems odd that a bottle would smell great to one person and smell like rubber to another.</li>
            <li>Reminds me of a mixture between Noxzema&#x27;s foaming face wash that was discontinued and the Clean &amp; Clear Morning Burst (which dries my face out beyond belief).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Only a small drop of this stuff is needed to wash my face with good suds.</li>
            <li>I love theis face wash works well and does make my skin dry and</li>
            <li>My skin looks fresh, clear, and dewy!</li>
            <li>It lathers up a little bit and washes off nicely, leaving no residue.</li>
            <li>Just a dab cleans the whole face and neck.</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>really is!&lt;br</li>
            <li>and i feel it really cleans.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a shame really</li>
            <li>After some gentle massage, I wash everything off and my skin feels great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When I bought this I was really going out on a limb.</li>
            <li>The consistency is perfect and it has erased 80% of my acne scars that were very dark along with some small blemishes in a month of using this &amp; Dr Bronner&#x27;s Castille Tea Tree Soap.</li>
            <li>It cleans your face completely and leaves you looking fresh and new.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still alba which is a decent product, but wanted what i ordered not the &#x27;newer version&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Since my acne is mainly from resting my chin/cheeks on my hands, until that habit stops I will always have breakouts.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this cleanser based on the reviews I read on here.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Like I said, been using it for 3+ years and can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>have tried many other products over the years and have come back to this one each time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This facial wash is for normal skin, not oily or really acne prone.</li>
            <li>Because I do have sensitive skin, I use this at night to remove makeup and any environmental residue (smoke, smog, etc), and then I use something even gentler, like Cetaphil, in the morning.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to start using natural products, so I came across this at Walmart for $9.98 and decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li>But gently go over my eyes last after washing as not to get any inside the eye.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I bought it because of all the natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>is has natural ingredients</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to scents and have sensitive skin-</li>
            <li>Instead, it feels soft and moisturized</li>
            <li>natural oils.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the aroma of this facial cleanser</li>
            <li>And i have felt more and more sick ever since using it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to all the plain cleansers that are filled with chemicals</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend this facial cleanser for anyone with combo skin.  </li>
            <li>I have a tendency to use too many harsh products on my face that cause it to dry up and break out.</li>
            <li>It really feels like it washes off impurities and dry skin without over drying your skin</li>
            <li>I will try their other products too, since this is my first Alba product.</li>
            <li>is that it is completely and totally cruelty-free.</li>
            <li>All Natural- has a 3 score on Skindeep&#x27;s database, very moderate risk of toxic chemicals</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m afraid to buy anything else as this cleanser has been such a pleasant experience for years.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because it was all natural, and also because I felt that even though it wasn&#x27;t an exfoliator (with little beads or granules), the pineapple enzyme still gave me a deep clean that didn&#x27;t dry out my skin, though I always use moisturizer on my face regardless.</li>
            <li>But after using this cleanser for the first time, my pores were refined and less noticeable.</li>
            <li>This works well for both my dry, sensitive skin and his oily one.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and am in my late 20&#x27;s, I have blackheads and mild breakouts.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is a little unusual for me, but it cleans my face well and it does not break me out.</li>

            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> really is!&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i feel it really cleans.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a shame really</li>
            <li> After some gentle massage, I wash everything off and my skin feels great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When I bought this I was really going out on a limb.</li>
            <li> The consistency is perfect and it has erased 80% of my acne scars that were very dark along with some small blemishes in a month of using this &amp; Dr Bronner&#x27;s Castille Tea Tree Soap.</li>
            <li> It cleans your face completely and leaves you looking fresh and new.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still alba which is a decent product, but wanted what i ordered not the &#x27;newer version&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Since my acne is mainly from resting my chin/cheeks on my hands, until that habit stops I will always have breakouts.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this cleanser based on the reviews I read on here.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Like I said, been using it for 3+ years and can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> have tried many other products over the years and have come back to this one each time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This facial wash is for normal skin, not oily or really acne prone.</li>
            <li> Because I do have sensitive skin, I use this at night to remove makeup and any environmental residue (smoke, smog, etc), and then I use something even gentler, like Cetaphil, in the morning.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to start using natural products, so I came across this at Walmart for $9.98 and decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> But gently go over my eyes last after washing as not to get any inside the eye.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I bought it because of all the natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> is has natural ingredients</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to scents and have sensitive skin-</li>
            <li> Instead, it feels soft and moisturized</li>
            <li> natural oils.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the aroma of this facial cleanser</li>
            <li> And i have felt more and more sick ever since using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to all the plain cleansers that are filled with chemicals</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend this facial cleanser for anyone with combo skin.  </li>
            <li> I have a tendency to use too many harsh products on my face that cause it to dry up and break out.</li>
            <li> It really feels like it washes off impurities and dry skin without over drying your skin</li>
            <li> I will try their other products too, since this is my first Alba product.</li>
            <li> is that it is completely and totally cruelty-free.</li>
            <li> All Natural- has a 3 score on Skindeep&#x27;s database, very moderate risk of toxic chemicals</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to buy anything else as this cleanser has been such a pleasant experience for years.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it was all natural, and also because I felt that even though it wasn&#x27;t an exfoliator (with little beads or granules), the pineapple enzyme still gave me a deep clean that didn&#x27;t dry out my skin, though I always use moisturizer on my face regardless.</li>
            <li> But after using this cleanser for the first time, my pores were refined and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> This works well for both my dry, sensitive skin and his oily one.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and am in my late 20&#x27;s, I have blackheads and mild breakouts.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is a little unusual for me, but it cleans my face well and it does not break me out.</li>
            <li> But the facial cleaner leaves skin really dry.</li>
            <li> I put a tiny bit on a wet baby wipe and it instantly dissolves ALL my makeup, including mascara and eye liner!  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t ever had a dry eye burning feeling before until i started taking this.</li>
            <li> Cleans well and doesn&#x27;t leave skin dry.</li>
            <li> I would prefer if it did not leave skin feeling so dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other reviews also said this product made skin dry.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t dry my face</li>
            <li> be careful, i didn&#x27;t get what was pictured.</li>
            <li> I thought i had pink eye</li>
            <li> I have not tried the Pineapple Scrub, but when I want some exfoliation, I lather up my face with the cleanser and dab on some plain white table sugar.</li>
            <li> Like some people said, a little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Unlike other cleansers, my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry and tight after I rinse.</li>
            <li> I have in the past used the same brand but tried the coconut milk one.</li>
            <li> have combo skin with acne around the chin and cheeks and this cleanser never hurts, stings, or irritates my blemishes (unlike a lot of other products).</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s hard to assess since skin types are so different, but I can say that before using this product I was using the Alba coconut wash and this pineapple cleanser seems to make my skin dryer than the coconut wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to return it because I purchased it as an add-on so its not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> Not worth the risk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve personally never experienced either of those and was surprised to hear that.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I will ever use any other face wash ever again!</li>
            <li> My skin doesnt get half as oily as it used to before using this</li>
            <li> Probably half the bottle was spilled inside.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll have this bottle for a million years because I use so little each day.</li>
            <li> Lots of review said this product was harsh on the eyes, but I haven&#x27;t noticed that.</li>
            <li> I just bought this on a whim a few days ago.  </li>
            <li> My skin was visibly brighter and clearer in less than a week!</li>
            <li> im not sure</li>
            <li> i used this for less than 1-2 week, and i had to stop it because it made my pores kept enlarged !!</li>
            <li> I always close my eyes when I wash this off my face and honestly do not experience any stinging.</li>
            <li> know someone did say that it burned their eyes a little bit and that it had a bad smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Clinique, but it&#x27;s so expensive.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately when I opened the sealed plastic envelope/bag it was in, to my surprise, it had leaked all over.</li>
            <li> The bottle says to avoid eye contact but that is impossible.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> be careful, i didn&#x27;t get what was pictured. it&#x27;s still alba which is a decent product, but wanted what i ordered not the &#x27;newer version&#x27;. my fault for not checking before the return window. lesson learned.</li>
            <li> I thought i had pink eye my eyes keep dryihg out and my throat has been feeling swollen ican&#x27;t figure out whats causing it only thing i can think of is its from this stuff. I haven&#x27;t ever had a dry eye burning feeling before until i started taking this. And i have felt more and more sick ever since using it. It could be something else im not sure so i give it 2 stars instead of 1. But I dont like how it feels or smells either. Smells kind of like rubber.</li>
            <li> I love theis face wash works well and does make my skin dry and no break outs! smells good too!</li>
            <li> I was looking for an organic, not tested on animals cleanser that would do as good a job as the regular stuff. This cleanser is great stuff. Cleans pores and smells great.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this cleanser based on the reviews I read on here.  I received it today and just used it.  It lathers up quickly and effectively washed my face but boy does it burn my eyes.  The bottle says to avoid eye contact but that is impossible.  I have to wash my forehead, temples and nose, all of which surround the eye area.  Halfway through splashing my face with water to rinse the cleanser off, I opened my eyes to see the areas that needed more rinsing.  Big mistake!  My eyes burned immediately.  I kept rinsing thoroughly, especially around the eye area.  I opened my eyes once again to make sure I had removed all the cleanser, especially around my hairline.  My eyes still burned and I had to keep rinsing until they stopped burning.  I am now leery of using this cleanser. The only eye makeup I use is non-waterproof mascara and I prefer a cleanser that I can use safely around my eyes. I&#x27;m not going to return it because I purchased it as an add-on so its not worth the hassle. Will not recommend or repurchase this product.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and feel of this cleanser.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, and my face feels good after using it. I have sensitive skin so this is a good thing!</li>
            <li> Mild and gentle formula. The scent is not overbearing. Nice suds. Cleans well and doesn&#x27;t leave skin dry.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot, and don&#x27;t get it in your eyes. I would prefer if it did not leave skin feeling so dry. Maybe good for someone with oily skin</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product it smells amazing. It isn&#x27;t liquids. The consistency is perfect and it has erased 80% of my acne scars that were very dark along with some small blemishes in a month of using this &amp; Dr Bronner&#x27;s Castille Tea Tree Soap. SunKissALba on YouTube recommended these products and I am satisfied with the results. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It burns your eyes and nostrils during use. Glad it&#x27;s not making me break out since I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love that this cleanser is not cream based and leaves my face feeling fresh and light. It thoroughly cleans my face, has pure ingredients, is a very fair price for the product and how long it lasts. I&#x27;m afraid to buy anything else as this cleanser has been such a pleasant experience for years.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It both smells and feels great.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim, and have had to restock because my husband loves it! This works well for both my dry, sensitive skin and his oily one. It smells like a tropical paradise (if you like pineapple like we do) and lathers easily. The price is a huge incentive too &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> smells amazing, love it ! i use it to remove my makeup</li>
            <li> I have a tendency to use too many harsh products on my face that cause it to dry up and break out. I purchased this because it was all natural, and also because I felt that even though it wasn&#x27;t an exfoliator (with little beads or granules), the pineapple enzyme still gave me a deep clean that didn&#x27;t dry out my skin, though I always use moisturizer on my face regardless. Because I do have sensitive skin, I use this at night to remove makeup and any environmental residue (smoke, smog, etc), and then I use something even gentler, like Cetaphil, in the morning. Like some people said, a little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really love about this product is that it is completely and totally cruelty-free. It has a the Leaping Bunny logo on the back of the bottle, which indicates that NONE of their products undergo animal testing during any phase. This means that neither Alba, nor its parent companies, nor any of its suppliers, test on animals. It also means that they do not sell their products in countries that test on animals (such as China). While this might not be a deciding factor for some people, it was for me. It&#x27;s not always easy to find cruelty-free products (ie: Leaping Bunny certified) in a store like Duane Reade or CVS, so when I came across this and really liked the results, I was very happy that they did not test on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know someone did say that it burned their eyes a little bit and that it had a bad smell. I&#x27;ve personally never experienced either of those and was surprised to hear that. So much so that I went as far as emailing Alba on their site to inform them of this because it seems odd that a bottle would smell great to one person and smell like rubber to another. I always close my eyes when I wash this off my face and honestly do not experience any stinging.</li>
            <li> this stuff smells great, doesnt over dry your face and cleans well. i would definitely buy again. i don&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Lots of review said this product was harsh on the eyes, but I haven&#x27;t noticed that. I keep my eyes shut when washing and rinsing my face, and without doing anything differently, my eyes have been fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviews also said this product made skin dry. That&#x27;s hard to assess since skin types are so different, but I can say that before using this product I was using the Alba coconut wash and this pineapple cleanser seems to make my skin dryer than the coconut wash. But it&#x27;s winter too, so who knows what&#x27;s at work. I have a nice moisturizer that I use after the shower and I&#x27;m fine all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only a small drop of this stuff is needed to wash my face with good suds. I think I&#x27;ll have this bottle for a million years because I use so little each day. I&#x27;ll probably use it for shaving when summer rolls around again as it&#x27;s nice and thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Amazon ever sells the Coconut Wash I&#x27;ll probably switch back to that, but I&#x27;m happy to keep using the Pineapple Cleanser too.</li>
            <li> This is a great facial cleanser. Just a dab cleans the whole face and neck. No residue or irritation. Just fresh, clean skin.</li>
            <li> How can I totally avoid my eyes when washing my face? I&#x27;ve gotten this product in my eyes a couple times and it HURTS. Like hell. Not worth the risk. My eyes are bloodshot and aching as I write this. Will stick with my Yes to Carrots face wash.</li>
            <li> This face wash is so nice and it smells amazing! The pineapple enzymes do a great job of shrinking pores and sloughing off dead skin. My skin is oily but flakey. I had been using Alba Even face wash for about 6 months and although I really liked it, it did nothing for my adult acne or flakey skin. I also use the Alba Papaya Enzyme Mask, and that combination is my dream team! My skin looks fresh, clear, and dewy! I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I really like it.  The consistency is a little unusual for me, but it cleans my face well and it does not break me out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years to remove my makeup every night.  It works wonderful.  Makeup dissolves easily (including eye).  Skin feels clean and fresh with no soapy or residue feel.I follow up with a toner and moisturizer and it makes my routine easy.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and how gentle this is on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 18 and I&#x27;m in love with this cleanser! I&#x27;m used to all the plain cleansers that are filled with chemicals and I wanted to start using natural products, so I came across this at Walmart for $9.98 and decided to give this a try. So when I got home, that night, I used it and fell in love. I love the results! Before I used it, my pores were so visible. My makeup wouldn&#x27;t even apply smoothly. But after using this cleanser for the first time, my pores were refined and less noticeable. And my makeup applied flawlessly! I highly recommend! :)</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and leaves your skin feeling clean and fresh. I will order more.&lt;br /&gt;The pineapple smell is great and it lathers up without using much.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cleanser for years. It cleans without stripping. My skin feels clean, even from sunscreen after use and I don&#x27;t feel a soapy residue. I don&#x27;t use it for eye makeup removal. But gently go over my eyes last after washing as not to get any inside the eye.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many other products over the years and have come back to this one each time.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin that will breakout easily and gets oily in the T-zone and this works well for me.</li>
            <li> Did not see a difference as when you use anew cleanser the frist time and did not see a difference after.</li>
            <li> I just bought this on a whim a few days ago.  I have rosacea and any oils or scrubbing are out of the question.  I&#x27;ve tried Clinique, but it&#x27;s so expensive.  I&#x27;ve tried Phisoderm, Neutrogena, Oil of Olay and many others, but they don&#x27;t take off my makeup very well.  I put a tiny bit on a wet baby wipe and it instantly dissolves ALL my makeup, including mascara and eye liner!  I won&#x27;t have to buy eye makeup remover anymore!&lt;br /&gt;It has a pleasant fragrance too.  I bought it because of all the natural ingredients.  I do have to moisturize after using it, but I am 49, so I do that anyway.  It doesn&#x27;t flair up my skin condition at all.  I will be buying this again and again!  I will try their other products too, since this is my first Alba product.</li>
            <li> I like this face wash. It gives a light tingle when washing your face and has a wonderful pineapple scent. It lathers up a little bit and washes off nicely, leaving no residue. It feels refreshing. I have in the past used the same brand but tried the coconut milk one. I like both equally and will buy either of them again. This one was sold at a better price this last time. I like that is has natural ingredients and it does last a while. A little goes a long way. I use it every morning. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love Alba. But the facial cleaner leaves skin really dry. I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my skin since I began using it. My Clinique works better for my skin. This facial wash is for normal skin, not oily or really acne prone. So if you already have descent skin and just need a cleanser this is it.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and am in my late 20&#x27;s, I have blackheads and mild breakouts.  I have tried every facial cleanser on the planet (maybe a bit obsessive about my skin some might say! :)) from high end to drug store and this is by far THE BEST facial cleanser I have ever used.  Here are some notes on why I love it so:&lt;br /&gt;1. All of my life, I have had to rotate facial cleansers, moisturizers, etc. I have been using this cleanser for probably 3 years+.  Every time I attempted to switch thinking it would be good for my skin, it would backfire and I would realize how good this cleanser really is!&lt;br /&gt;2. This cleanser really helps control my breakouts and clogged pores, I RARELY breakout anymore-which is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;3. It helps control my shine/ oily/ problem areas.  My skin doesnt get half as oily as it used to before using this cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;4. All Natural- has a 3 score on Skindeep&#x27;s database, very moderate risk of toxic chemicals&lt;br /&gt;5. I am sensitive to scents and have sensitive skin- this does not bother me at all&lt;br /&gt;6. The price- hello!&lt;br /&gt;7. It really feels like it washes off impurities and dry skin without over drying your skin&lt;br /&gt;8. The ergonomics of the bottle/ pump are really easy to use in the shower or at a sink&lt;br /&gt;9. I use this cleanser with the Green Tea Oil Free facial moisturizer (same brand/ line) and it is the PERFECT combo for combination skin.  Their Pineapple Enzyme Facial mask is also AMAZING and part my weekly routine, I always get compliments on my glowing skin after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend this facial cleanser for anyone with combo skin.  Like I said, been using it for 3+ years and can&#x27;t live without it.  Feel free to ask me any questions!</li>
            <li> love the smell and the freshness. it doesn&#x27;t dry my face and i feel it really cleans. i&#x27;m already a fan of alba products and i&#x27;m sure i will repurchase this one.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this product but unfortunately when I opened the sealed plastic envelope/bag it was in, to my surprise, it had leaked all over. Probably half the bottle was spilled inside. I can&#x27;t use the facial cleaner it&#x27;s a shame really, I was looking forward to it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I will ever use any other face wash ever again! This cleanser is amazing! It&#x27;s very light but very effective at removing my makeup (I wear Bare Minerals). Unlike other cleansers, my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry and tight after I rinse. Instead, it feels soft and moisturized so I know it&#x27;s not stripping my own natural oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser is clear, with a fantastic scent, that works up into a rich lather. I have not tried the Pineapple Scrub, but when I want some exfoliation, I lather up my face with the cleanser and dab on some plain white table sugar. After some gentle massage, I wash everything off and my skin feels great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combo skin with acne around the chin and cheeks and this cleanser never hurts, stings, or irritates my blemishes (unlike a lot of other products). Since my acne is mainly from resting my chin/cheeks on my hands, until that habit stops I will always have breakouts. Luckily, this cleanser works so well and now that my skin feels so good, I don&#x27;t want to touch my face anymore!</li>
            <li> When I bought this I was really going out on a limb. I like to read reviews for all skin care product before purchasing. This cleanser has a surprisingly cooling effect on the skin. Reminds me of a mixture between Noxzema&#x27;s foaming face wash that was discontinued and the Clean &amp; Clear Morning Burst (which dries my face out beyond belief). I love the smell, and it cleans my Mac foundation off way better than Cetaphil. Great product!</li>
            <li> good for skin care. also, it is good for cleansing make up.  if I used this stuff twice, all of my make up is gone w/o being greasy!!!!    [update 2/12]Ok. i used this for less than 1-2 week, and i had to stop it because it made my pores kept enlarged !! NO NO NO!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. It cleans your face completely and leaves you looking fresh and new. The price was much better than at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> Excellent!  Would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! My skin was visibly brighter and clearer in less than a week!</li>
            <li> Very nice cleanser, leaves face feeling soft, not dry. Smells really good too--- I would buy again!!</li>
            <li> Great facial cleanser and priced nicely! I looked at this facial cleanser at a local &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; store and I swooned over it at that shop but it was priced much higher then what I wanted to pay so I looked it up on Amazon and I liked the price Amazon had. I really like the aroma of this facial cleanser and it leaves my face feeling clean, fresh and soft...the smell doesn&#x27;t stay on the skin...simply a nice aroma as the face is being cleansed.</li>
