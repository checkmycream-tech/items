            <li>I have noticed a nice improvement in my complexion.</li>
            <li>If you want the most value for your money, you could go with Bioderma, and I&#x27;ve heard the Sephora brand cleansing water is good also.</li>
            <li>I love this product and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li>takes a bit more work to remove waterproof mascara</li>

            <li>I tried this product because I&#x27;m under an acne treatment, so I needed something that won&#x27;t let anything in my skin, and this is perfect, I just pour something on a cleaning pad and clean my face and after it dries my skin is very soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, and very effective.</li>
            <li>There is no doubt that your skin is clean after using more over your skin</li>
            <li>So this is fine, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll repurchase.</li>
            <li>This one is fine, but honestly the price is too much for what this is.</li>

            <li>I love this product and use it as my primary facial cleanser since giving up soap and water cleansers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it  if there is a deal next time. :)</li>
            <li>Wish I had this my whole life!</li>
            <li>I have since repurchased, and intend to get more in the future.</li>

            <li>It is soft and dont hurt your skin.</li>

            <li>I really wanted a new micellar water after running out of my little Bioderma one.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and easy to remove my make up base.  I like it. I will continue to use it  if there is a deal next time. :)</li>
            <li> Wish I had this my whole life! This product cleans eye make up lipstick and foundation. There is no doubt that your skin is clean after using more over your skin is left feeling moisturized. I have noticed a nice improvement in my complexion. A little goes a long way so although it may seem expensive it does last a long time. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Good on sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I tried this product because I&#x27;m under an acne treatment, so I needed something that won&#x27;t let anything in my skin, and this is perfect, I just pour something on a cleaning pad and clean my face and after it dries my skin is very soft. I love this product and I would buy it again. I would recommend it if you like non-greasy removers.</li>
            <li> Apply with a cottonball. Takes off my eyeliner with little effort. That&#x27;s all I can ask for in a makeup remover, it doesn&#x27;t sting or smell.</li>
            <li> I really wanted a new micellar water after running out of my little Bioderma one. This one is fine, but honestly the price is too much for what this is. If you want the most value for your money, you could go with Bioderma, and I&#x27;ve heard the Sephora brand cleansing water is good also. So this is fine, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll repurchase.</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it as my primary facial cleanser since giving up soap and water cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t strip away moisture from my skin. I follow it with a spritz of mineral water and moisturizer. After just a few weeks, I no longer need foundation and use only a lightly tinted moisturizer. I wish I had found this years ago.</li>
            <li> I use this every night to remove my  minimal makeup from the day before washing with a cleanser. It doesn&#x27;t break me out like makeup wipes do! It&#x27;s gentle, and very effective. I have since repurchased, and intend to get more in the future.</li>
            <li> It is soft and dont hurt your skin. However, the issue is it cannot remove the eye makeup! What&#x27;s the point of buying an makeup remover!!!</li>
            <li> My skin is allergy and sensitive. This make up remover is goo to me.</li>
            <li> takes a bit more work to remove waterproof mascara but I like that it doesn&#x27;t feel oily.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t remove my waterproof eye makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend camomile makeup remover by Bodyshop  to anyone who is looking for waterproof makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I LIKE IT ,I LOVE IT ,,I LIKE IT ,I LOVI LIKE IT ,I LOVE IT ,,E IT ,,I LIKE IT ,I LOVE IT ,,</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice on sensitive skin</li>
            <li> No negativity toward seller.  It is the product I do not care for.  I expected better results from the research I did.</li>
            <li> I received this product on time. Love this product.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but this time I had to. I would give this 0 stars if I could for what it did to my skin. I usually use Bioderm and ran out and thought I&#x27;d give this a try and what a mistake that was. First of all it made my skin unusually dry after use, second of all it barely took of my makeup and because of all that my skin started to break out badly in weird bumps and cystic pimples. This is scented so it has a chemical for it in the product. My skin&#x27;s sensitivity isn&#x27;t high but this one is just really not good for taking off any makeup despite what it says.</li>
