            <li>I love this color!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for more than that!</li>
            <li>Great price for FULL SIZE!</li>
            <li>Very rich color..only took 2 coats !</li>
            <li>mo3F82E52KYHFKS]]This is a beautiful high gloss color that looks just great on your fingernails.  </li>
            <li>Color is nice.</li>
            <li>I bought this hoping to find something I liked just as well.  </li>
            <li>By far the best gel color out there!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s looks nice and twinkle and looks even better</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sassy but kind of elegant.</li>
            <li>It looks great alone, but I also recommend layering two coats of Bella&#x27;s Vampire with one coat of Sweet Chocolate on top.</li>
            <li>Even for someone that is not so good with nail polish, if you follow the steps, you will have beautiful professional looking nails.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The bubble swatch of the color is very accurate in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It went on very smoothly, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>Has good coverage on 2 coats, but like many of the dark gel colors 3 coats makes it perfect.</li>
            <li>My video shows the high gloss and the beautiful shinny surface.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to keep the cuticle areas free of polish!</li>
            <li>I love the color its just not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>who doesn&#x27;t love Bella</li>
            <li>I love, love the harmony gelish system.</li>
            <li>I added water field over the top for some additional sparkle.</li>
            <li>I love Gelish products</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>You may need more than two coats to achieve an even color.</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t LOVE it.  </li>

            <li>I thought the consistency was fine and the color as pictured.</li>

            <li>Fabulous  fall or winter color.</li>
            <li>This color was not toourple or light as I was worried it would be.</li>
            <li>when you see it in the light you can see the purple coming through.</li>
            <li>Do two light coats and you will get the results you want.</li>
            <li>I love gelish polish it worth every penny</li>
            <li>I used the Gelish UV mini light.</li>
            <li>Absolutely fabulous.</li>
            <li>i was pleased with another of gelish&#x27;s polishes that i&#x27;d previously tried and its  truly a great deal for such consistent delivery of perfect results.</li>
            <li>Product was very fresh.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping, love it!</li>
            <li>Beautiful dark purple/burgundy color that looks almost black indoors but a beautiful burgundy in the sun!</li>
            <li>Takes a bit longer to cure (few more mins) but shining great.</li>
            <li>it appeared as a bright blue, of all things.</li>
            <li>But I really like this color and have gotten many compliments.</li>
            <li>Good, deep reddish purple in color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great color, dark and rich, but not goth.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping and packaged well.</li>
            <li>Shipped quick and on time.</li>
            <li>this is a very pretty color.</li>
            <li>Very pretty color and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the gelish family and love the Harmony products.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time doing an at home relish manicure and so far I am loving it.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE Gelish and can do my own gel-mani in less than 30 min</li>
            <li>favorite gelish color so far.</li>
            <li>It only took one coat to get the color I liked</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wearing it right now.</li>
            <li>It is easy and has a BEAUTIFUL outcome that lasts me AT LEAST 2 weeks!!  </li>
            <li>if you are new to using shellac do LIGHT layers.</li>
            <li>Perfect color for fall/winter; there is enough purple that it doesn&#x27;t look solid black and has lasted longer than most gels on my nails.</li>
            <li>exactly what i was looking for.  </li>
            <li>but I agree that most colors in reality look different from the color pictures on their website.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Looks outstanding on short nails.</li>
            <li>Love this, and usually only requires 2 coats.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Looks great on short and long nails.</li>
            <li>I just recently bought the Harmony Gel Nail Polish along with the foundation gel, top polish an a 36 watt UV lamp.</li>
            <li>The color is exactly how it looks.</li>
            <li>I cure the first coat for 3 minutes then cure the second coat for 3 minutes and cure the \\&quot;top it</li>
            <li>This was the first shade I bought...</li>
            <li>It was my first color I bought with the Gelish products.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>This gel nailpolish is the exact color they show online.  </li>
            <li>I love to apply water field over it to give it a bigger sparkle!</li>
            <li>My manicurist used it on me several times and I fell in love it.</li>
            <li>When you hold it up to natural light it is violet- noticeably purple.</li>
            <li>Even though it wasn&#x27;t exactly the color I had thought it was</li>
            <li>Every time I cure my nails on the last step (top coat)</li>
            <li>In dim light the color looks like black, with more light</li>
            <li>I top it off with IBD clear builder gel, stronger than any other gel top coats I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Very nice dark purple, but not black</li>
            <li>It has a hint of dark red in it, which i think is beautiful.  </li>
            <li>Thin coats works best, as with all the colors, and two coats covered completely.</li>
            <li>perfect if you like dark, but don&#x27;t want black.</li>
            <li>This is a deep beautiful color, almost black with purplish reddish undertones.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a really nice dark color with a hint of purple.</li>
            <li>It is a nice, DARK, opaque purple after 2 to 3 coats.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how quickly I received the product and protected so professionally.</li>
            <li>(I use the Gelish mini LED light, which takes half the drying time of the UV light).    </li>
            <li>, I used my usual Gelish topcoat and it seems exceptionally shiny.</li>
            <li>This product is even better than expected.</li>
            <li>but I really like it</li>
            <li>I, like most, spent $35</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very settle.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li>However, in the light it is a very deep plum.</li>
            <li>my nail polish shrinks so much at the tip of my nails</li>
            <li>The ENTIRE Gelish line is exactly what I have been looking for!!</li>
            <li>Must be applied by a professional nail technician and cured with their special light, in order to achieve expected results.</li>
            <li>I had to do about 3 coats before I felt like it was evenly covered on all nails due to the fact that the thinner the layer the better staying power the polish has.  </li>
            <li>It is a deep rich black/purple.</li>
            <li>I like this color against my skin tone more than other darker colors out there.  </li>
            <li>My manicure lasts well over 2 weeks even though I was dishes daily and clean the house.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more of a black color, but this is very purple.</li>
            <li>I think the picture is true to the actual color</li>
            <li>Just remember that this is a dark color so it will take a bit more time to cure in your UV nail dryer.</li>
            <li>I love this color its dark with a purple-red tint.</li>
            <li>and I am usually a pretty busy gal</li>
            <li>I give myself three coats to get full coverage of this deep reddish purple.  </li>
            <li>I placed my order and payment, and next day was told the item was really out of stock even though it was still currently advertised as having more than twenty of the item still in stock...</li>
            <li>I love how dark and seductive this color is.</li>
            <li>This color resembles OPI&#x27;s famous Lincoln Park after Dark nail color.</li>
            <li>Lovely dark magenta purple color - much more purple than black</li>
            <li>As other have noted, this last more than 2 weeks and is worth every dollar.  </li>
            <li>The Color is way more purple than black.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t look black like most purple nail polishes do.</li>
            <li>Also, I wear a lot of red, black, and white, so the color looks really lovely with most of my outfits.</li>
            <li>After Midnight (more purpely vs. black).  </li>
            <li>When applied it&#x27;s vibrant color and shine stayed for three weeks without chipping or fading.</li>
            <li>never going back to regular nail polish on my hands again :)</li>
            <li>High quality item, like it a lot</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s high gloss for weeks</li>
            <li>I would highly recommended Bella&#x27;s Vampire as a nail color staple.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I love gelish products and they definitely last as long as they say they will when you put them on correctly.</li>
            <li>All the extra effort was worth</li>
            <li>Quite the color rollercoaster, and it seems that depending what light you hold it in, whether natural sunlight, artificial indoor light or LED light, it kinda changes, but for indoor lighting it is gonna show up almost black-looking like you see here.</li>
            <li>A dark, dramatic color perfect for fall/winter.  </li>
            <li>love the color it is a dark purple and doesn&#x27;t look black or blue which i love.</li>
            <li>I keep saying that I&#x27;m going to wear a new color in 2 weeks</li>
            <li>I am a brand new Gelish system user..</li>
            <li>In the light it looks like a dark grape color and</li>
            <li>This color does actually turn out pretty close to the swatch.</li>
            <li>Came out exactly the same color as it is on the internet.</li>
            <li>For those of you who like dark colors but don&#x27;t always want to wear plain black, this is perfect.  </li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of \\&quot;Black Berry</li>
            <li>Without the light it looks almost black.</li>
            <li>More of a deep red, pretty none the less.</li>
            <li>This a dark rich plummy cherry color.</li>
            <li>Bella&#x27;s Vampire is a dark rich Gelish Soak Off Gel polish that stays for up to two weeks for me</li>
            <li>It almost looks like a deep black cherry, just lovely.</li>
            <li>It is a deep, rich and dark color that you will really like.  </li>
            <li>The color is actually a deep, rich plum which was just what I was looking for (thanks other reviewers for providing clarified information regarding this color!).  </li>
            <li>I originally thought this was black until I received it</li>
            <li>Gelish is rather hard to remove and I like CND products better.</li>
            <li>Love the dark Vamp look !!!</li>
            <li>only do 2 light layers over a base coat and cover in a light top coat.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s too much of a hassle to send back.</li>
            <li>Gelish brand is all I&#x27;ve used in UV so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been 4 days so far and no chips.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very opaque, so it only needs 2 coats, and I had no wrinkling--even with thicker coats!</li>
            <li>and my hands see a lot of action.</li>
            <li>This is def a color any professional can wear.</li>
            <li>this is a near match for OPI&#x27;s Lincoln Park</li>
            <li>Make sure you do not put it on too thick as it will peel.</li>
            <li>The swatch for this polish wasn&#x27;t accurate at all - the picture makes it look black!  </li>
            <li>Vampire is a larger bottle than we can find in the local beauty supply stores and it contains about 66% more for less money.  </li>
            <li>It actually looked decent when I applied one coat, but I wanted it darker</li>
            <li>inside low light almost looks black</li>
            <li>Lovely dark color that is almost black in some light and a deep purple in other lights.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a dark wine color and not the dark purple I thought it would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a dark dark purple, still love the color.</li>
            <li>but I really wasn&#x27;t expecting it to have such a red undertone.  </li>
            <li>The color is pretty dark but not black, it does have a hint of red/purple</li>
            <li>This is true to Eggplant color, a deep purple black.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a super dark, matte deep red/purple.</li>
            <li>It only takes a couple of coats to complete your manicure.</li>
            <li>I added a bit of pink sparkle to my ring finger and that really brought out the purple color.</li>
            <li>It can streak if you&#x27;re not careful when applying.  </li>
            <li>This color is a very dark purple, almost black the more layers you add.  </li>
            <li>I thought this color would be closer to black, and in dim light, it does look black.</li>
            <li>It turn out pretty close to black.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not black but not red.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very dark purpley-black - exactly like eggplant.</li>
            <li>After Dark and this is VERY close.</li>
            <li>I am NOT a professional nail tech, but my results look as though they were done by a professional nail tech.  </li>
            <li>It goes on blood red at first and by the second coat shows up as dark as you see in the thumbnail.</li>
            <li>This is almost black but you can really see the plum accent coming out.</li>
            <li>I really do like it, a black purple</li>
            <li>then my other Gelish colors ( Pink smoothie, Hot rod red for example).</li>

            <li> Can&#x27;t ask for more than that!</li>
            <li> Great price for FULL SIZE!</li>
            <li> Very rich color..only took 2 coats !</li>
            <li> mo3F82E52KYHFKS]]This is a beautiful high gloss color that looks just great on your fingernails.  </li>
            <li> Color is nice.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping to find something I liked just as well.  </li>
            <li> By far the best gel color out there!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s looks nice and twinkle and looks even better</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sassy but kind of elegant.</li>
            <li> It looks great alone, but I also recommend layering two coats of Bella&#x27;s Vampire with one coat of Sweet Chocolate on top.</li>
            <li> Even for someone that is not so good with nail polish, if you follow the steps, you will have beautiful professional looking nails.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The bubble swatch of the color is very accurate in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It went on very smoothly, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Has good coverage on 2 coats, but like many of the dark gel colors 3 coats makes it perfect.</li>
            <li> My video shows the high gloss and the beautiful shinny surface.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to keep the cuticle areas free of polish!</li>
            <li> I love the color its just not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> who doesn&#x27;t love Bella</li>
            <li> I love, love the harmony gelish system.</li>
            <li> I added water field over the top for some additional sparkle.</li>
            <li> I love Gelish products</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> You may need more than two coats to achieve an even color.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot more &amp;#34;black cherry&amp;#34; and not as &amp;#34;grape&amp;#34; as I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I love this color.</li>

            <li> This is a nice dark purple color, great for fall.</li>
            <li> I thought the consistency was fine and the color as pictured.</li>
            <li> looks great on it&#x27;s own, but if you like a little bling try topping it off with water field.</li>
            <li> is the first nail polish system that holds up to my every day activities and looks shiny, beautiful and professionally done.&lt;br /&gt;Im</li>
            <li> Fabulous  fall or winter color.</li>
            <li> This color was not toourple or light as I was worried it would be.</li>
            <li> when you see it in the light you can see the purple coming through.</li>

            <li> I love gelish polish it worth every penny</li>

            <li> Super fast shipping, love it!</li>
            <li> Beautiful dark purple/burgundy color that looks almost black indoors but a beautiful burgundy in the sun!</li>
            <li> Takes a bit longer to cure (few more mins) but shining great.</li>
            <li> it appeared as a bright blue, of all things.</li>
            <li> But I really like this color and have gotten many compliments.</li>
            <li> Good, deep reddish purple in color.</li>

            <li> Shipped quick and on time.</li>

            <li> Very pretty color and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the gelish family and love the Harmony products.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time doing an at home relish manicure and so far I am loving it.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE Gelish and can do my own gel-mani in less than 30 min</li>
            <li> favorite gelish color so far.</li>
            <li> It only took one coat to get the color I liked</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wearing it right now.</li>
            <li> It is easy and has a BEAUTIFUL outcome that lasts me AT LEAST 2 weeks!!  </li>
            <li> if you are new to using shellac do LIGHT layers.</li>
            <li> Perfect color for fall/winter; there is enough purple that it doesn&#x27;t look solid black and has lasted longer than most gels on my nails.</li>
            <li> exactly what i was looking for.  </li>
            <li> but I agree that most colors in reality look different from the color pictures on their website.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Looks outstanding on short nails.</li>
            <li> Love this, and usually only requires 2 coats.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Looks great on short and long nails.</li>
            <li> I just recently bought the Harmony Gel Nail Polish along with the foundation gel, top polish an a 36 watt UV lamp.</li>
            <li> The color is exactly how it looks.</li>
            <li> I cure the first coat for 3 minutes then cure the second coat for 3 minutes and cure the \\&quot;top it</li>
            <li> This was the first shade I bought...</li>
            <li> It was my first color I bought with the Gelish products.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This gel nailpolish is the exact color they show online.  </li>
            <li> I love to apply water field over it to give it a bigger sparkle!</li>
            <li> My manicurist used it on me several times and I fell in love it.</li>
            <li> When you hold it up to natural light it is violet- noticeably purple.</li>
            <li> Even though it wasn&#x27;t exactly the color I had thought it was</li>
            <li> Every time I cure my nails on the last step (top coat)</li>
            <li> In dim light the color looks like black, with more light</li>
            <li> I top it off with IBD clear builder gel, stronger than any other gel top coats I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Very nice dark purple, but not black</li>
            <li> It has a hint of dark red in it, which i think is beautiful.  </li>
            <li> Thin coats works best, as with all the colors, and two coats covered completely.</li>
            <li> perfect if you like dark, but don&#x27;t want black.</li>
            <li> This is a deep beautiful color, almost black with purplish reddish undertones.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a really nice dark color with a hint of purple.</li>
            <li> It is a nice, DARK, opaque purple after 2 to 3 coats.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how quickly I received the product and protected so professionally.</li>
            <li> (I use the Gelish mini LED light, which takes half the drying time of the UV light).    </li>
            <li> , I used my usual Gelish topcoat and it seems exceptionally shiny.</li>
            <li> This product is even better than expected.</li>
            <li> but I really like it</li>
            <li> I, like most, spent $35</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very settle.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li> However, in the light it is a very deep plum.</li>
            <li> my nail polish shrinks so much at the tip of my nails</li>
            <li> The ENTIRE Gelish line is exactly what I have been looking for!!</li>
            <li> Must be applied by a professional nail technician and cured with their special light, in order to achieve expected results.</li>
            <li> I had to do about 3 coats before I felt like it was evenly covered on all nails due to the fact that the thinner the layer the better staying power the polish has.  </li>
            <li> It is a deep rich black/purple.</li>
            <li> I like this color against my skin tone more than other darker colors out there.  </li>
            <li> My manicure lasts well over 2 weeks even though I was dishes daily and clean the house.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more of a black color, but this is very purple.</li>
            <li> I think the picture is true to the actual color</li>
            <li> Just remember that this is a dark color so it will take a bit more time to cure in your UV nail dryer.</li>
            <li> I love this color its dark with a purple-red tint.</li>
            <li> and I am usually a pretty busy gal</li>
            <li> I give myself three coats to get full coverage of this deep reddish purple.  </li>
            <li> I placed my order and payment, and next day was told the item was really out of stock even though it was still currently advertised as having more than twenty of the item still in stock...</li>
            <li> I love how dark and seductive this color is.</li>
            <li> This color resembles OPI&#x27;s famous Lincoln Park after Dark nail color.</li>
            <li> Lovely dark magenta purple color - much more purple than black</li>
            <li> As other have noted, this last more than 2 weeks and is worth every dollar.  </li>
            <li> The Color is way more purple than black.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t look black like most purple nail polishes do.</li>
            <li> Also, I wear a lot of red, black, and white, so the color looks really lovely with most of my outfits.</li>
            <li> After Midnight (more purpely vs. black).  </li>
            <li> When applied it&#x27;s vibrant color and shine stayed for three weeks without chipping or fading.</li>
            <li> never going back to regular nail polish on my hands again :)</li>
            <li> High quality item, like it a lot</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s high gloss for weeks</li>
            <li> I would highly recommended Bella&#x27;s Vampire as a nail color staple.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love gelish products and they definitely last as long as they say they will when you put them on correctly.</li>
            <li> All the extra effort was worth</li>
            <li> Quite the color rollercoaster, and it seems that depending what light you hold it in, whether natural sunlight, artificial indoor light or LED light, it kinda changes, but for indoor lighting it is gonna show up almost black-looking like you see here.</li>
            <li> A dark, dramatic color perfect for fall/winter.  </li>
            <li> love the color it is a dark purple and doesn&#x27;t look black or blue which i love.</li>
            <li> I keep saying that I&#x27;m going to wear a new color in 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I am a brand new Gelish system user..</li>
            <li> In the light it looks like a dark grape color and</li>
            <li> This color does actually turn out pretty close to the swatch.</li>
            <li> Came out exactly the same color as it is on the internet.</li>
            <li> For those of you who like dark colors but don&#x27;t always want to wear plain black, this is perfect.  </li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of \\&quot;Black Berry</li>
            <li> Without the light it looks almost black.</li>
            <li> More of a deep red, pretty none the less.</li>
            <li> This a dark rich plummy cherry color.</li>
            <li> Bella&#x27;s Vampire is a dark rich Gelish Soak Off Gel polish that stays for up to two weeks for me</li>
            <li> It almost looks like a deep black cherry, just lovely.</li>
            <li> It is a deep, rich and dark color that you will really like.  </li>
            <li> The color is actually a deep, rich plum which was just what I was looking for (thanks other reviewers for providing clarified information regarding this color!).  </li>
            <li> I originally thought this was black until I received it</li>
            <li> Gelish is rather hard to remove and I like CND products better.</li>
            <li> Love the dark Vamp look !!!</li>
            <li> only do 2 light layers over a base coat and cover in a light top coat.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s too much of a hassle to send back.</li>
            <li> Gelish brand is all I&#x27;ve used in UV so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 4 days so far and no chips.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very opaque, so it only needs 2 coats, and I had no wrinkling--even with thicker coats!</li>
            <li> and my hands see a lot of action.</li>
            <li> This is def a color any professional can wear.</li>
            <li> this is a near match for OPI&#x27;s Lincoln Park</li>
            <li> Make sure you do not put it on too thick as it will peel.</li>
            <li> The swatch for this polish wasn&#x27;t accurate at all - the picture makes it look black!  </li>
            <li> Vampire is a larger bottle than we can find in the local beauty supply stores and it contains about 66% more for less money.  </li>
            <li> It actually looked decent when I applied one coat, but I wanted it darker</li>
            <li> inside low light almost looks black</li>
            <li> Lovely dark color that is almost black in some light and a deep purple in other lights.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a dark wine color and not the dark purple I thought it would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a dark dark purple, still love the color.</li>
            <li> but I really wasn&#x27;t expecting it to have such a red undertone.  </li>
            <li> The color is pretty dark but not black, it does have a hint of red/purple</li>
            <li> This is true to Eggplant color, a deep purple black.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a super dark, matte deep red/purple.</li>
            <li> It only takes a couple of coats to complete your manicure.</li>
            <li> I added a bit of pink sparkle to my ring finger and that really brought out the purple color.</li>
            <li> It can streak if you&#x27;re not careful when applying.  </li>
            <li> This color is a very dark purple, almost black the more layers you add.  </li>
            <li> I thought this color would be closer to black, and in dim light, it does look black.</li>
            <li> It turn out pretty close to black.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not black but not red.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very dark purpley-black - exactly like eggplant.</li>
            <li> After Dark and this is VERY close.</li>
            <li> I am NOT a professional nail tech, but my results look as though they were done by a professional nail tech.  </li>
            <li> It goes on blood red at first and by the second coat shows up as dark as you see in the thumbnail.</li>
            <li> This is almost black but you can really see the plum accent coming out.</li>
            <li> I really do like it, a black purple</li>
            <li> then my other Gelish colors ( Pink smoothie, Hot rod red for example).</li>
            <li> so this bottle should last a really long time.</li>
            <li> Three thin layers for true depth of the color.  </li>
            <li> It looks black far away</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get a true idea of what the color will look like in person when looking at the little dot online.</li>
            <li> Black Cherry Berry is clearly a really dark red, and this color is dark purple that&#x27;s pretty close to the swatch.  </li>
            <li> This size of bottle will do your fingernails for a long time.</li>
            <li> But, due to the reasons stated above, I had to take one star off.</li>
            <li> If not cured long enough it will come off since the color is so dark.</li>
            <li> It did pull a little from the edges, so I flash cured each nail for 10 sec, prior to regular cure for each layer.</li>
            <li> Bella&#x27;s Vampire is a dark purplish red color with a lot of character.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a deep dark purple</li>
            <li> DEEP AND DARK..</li>
            <li> Its such a dark color that it goes with anything.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very irritating to have to clean up each swatch.</li>
            <li> Lots of people have compared this to Black Cherry Berry and say that it&#x27;s the same, but it&#x27;s not.  </li>
            <li> It needs two solid coats to even out the color, and results in a nail color that is nearly black with a hint of purple.</li>
            <li> I choose this color because I wanted something timeless that will work at the office, black tie events or any other social happening.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American, and this is a very very dark purple, almost black.</li>
            <li> and i have two little chips, but only because I am a nail picker.  </li>
            <li> This color is a very dark, deep, burgandy/red.</li>
            <li> However: the color was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> and i can be rough with my hands.</li>
            <li> In the light it shines to a deep red bloody purple color.</li>
            <li> it could pass for black but it has a slight purple/deep red hue to it.</li>
            <li> It looks like a dark, dark plum (almost black with purple and red tones).</li>
            <li> so I bought this and other shades of Gelish purple..</li>
            <li> I expected that, but what I did not expect was to have to use three coats of polish to get it as dark as it looks in then picture.</li>
            <li> Stores will usually sell the MINI version for about the same, or for even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only complaint that I have is that it&#x27;s a little thin, so you do not need much color on the brush at all.</li>
            <li> For dark colors keep under the lamp for 3 minutes.each coat of polish.</li>
            <li> This was the dark purple I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It is dark for those of us who like the darker nail polish</li>
            <li> A purplish type dark redish color.</li>
            <li> I have only one complaint about this product...</li>
            <li> No curing issues even with the dark color.</li>
            <li> This polish was too dark for my taste.  </li>
            <li> and i was tired of paying all that money for solar nails, plus i wanted to wear my natural nails.</li>
            <li> Upon ordering this I was expecting the polish to be black or in that close proximity but instead is a dark plum/purple color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really, really dark purple-y grape color that looks almost black.  </li>
            <li> it looks like black cherry, and if you go in the sun it looks dark purple.</li>
            <li> It is dark... not too purple, not too black.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting a almost black color with a hint of purple, but even after three coats it was just a dark purple.</li>
            <li> it was ..will try another black</li>
            <li> Almost black.</li>
            <li> , I thought it was going to black</li>
            <li> Wish it was black.</li>
            <li> Will  check at Sally\\&quot;s to see if they have black.</li>
            <li> Looks black , which was what I was going for.</li>
            <li> it looks black but out in the sun</li>
            <li> I was looking for a black, this is not it.</li>
            <li> The image appears to be almost black, which is what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> A little too dark for my tastes.  </li>
            <li> It can look a little goth, but it&#x27;s fall, so why not go dark on the nails?</li>
            <li> This created a very dark, metalic brown that turned almost a slightly greenish/brown in the sunlight.</li>
            <li> A very dark plum color with no shimmer.</li>
            <li> then you dont know what you are missing.</li>
            <li> If I had known that I wouldn&#x27;t have brought it, it&#x27;s kind of a boring color.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money &amp; time!  </li>
            <li> it is NOT cute.</li>
            <li> Very dark purple, almost black, and so dramatic.</li>
            <li> With that said, the actual color is sort of a violet, with a red base.</li>
            <li> big disappointment</li>
            <li> It will peal and chip quicker if you do it to thick.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a problem with the brand, but I had a very hard time applying this polish because it was so runny and thin.  </li>
            <li> But everyone tired of spending money on getting their nails done need to get the trial kit.</li>
            <li> I did 3 very thin coats and had a lot of trouble with the color leaching into the crack between my nail and finger, which was impossible to prevent or correct.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Gelish.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll try another color and see if I just got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> and you CANNOT GO WRONG!!</li>
            <li> and I am horrible with my nail.s</li>

    <ol>
            <li> With two coats it&#x27;s darker than the picture looks. It turn out pretty close to black. And I can&#x27;t only do one coat, otherwise it&#x27;d look like the color shown</li>
            <li> love the color it is a dark purple and doesn&#x27;t look black or blue which i love. if you are new to using shellac do LIGHT layers. It will peal and chip quicker if you do it to thick. only do 2 light layers over a base coat and cover in a light top coat.</li>
            <li> I did not like this color it had no coverage and had t have 3 coat to be the blackish it was ..will try another black</li>
            <li> This color is a very dark, deep, burgandy/red. Almost black. I did not see any purple in this color. It looks great alone, but I also recommend layering two coats of Bella&#x27;s Vampire with one coat of Sweet Chocolate on top. This created a very dark, metalic brown that turned almost a slightly greenish/brown in the sunlight. Totally awesome!</li>
            <li> The ENTIRE Gelish line is exactly what I have been looking for!! It is easy and has a BEAUTIFUL outcome that lasts me AT LEAST 2 weeks!!  I have been using this line for over 3 months now.  This color is simply gorgeous on me too...I get loads of compliments on my perfect polish! Just follow the YOU TUBE video on how to apply HARMONY GELISH POLISH and you CANNOT GO WRONG!! I advise you to use all the HARMONY products that are available for each step to achieve the perfect polished look that will last for weeks! I am NOT a professional nail tech, but my results look as though they were done by a professional nail tech.  Just make sure you use THIN coats of everything, and TAKE YOUR TIME!  I can do both my hands in UNDER an HOUR!</li>
            <li> I love this color! For those of you who like dark colors but don&#x27;t always want to wear plain black, this is perfect.  It has a hint of dark red in it, which i think is beautiful.  Goes on easy with two coats.  This is my first time doing an at home relish manicure and so far I am loving it.  Its been on for a week and i have two little chips, but only because I am a nail picker.  Make sure to keep the cuticle areas free of polish!</li>
            <li> exactly what i was looking for.  i got a really deep purple/plumish color with two coats. looks great on it&#x27;s own, but if you like a little bling try topping it off with water field. i added one coat of water field before i was done and i absolutely loved it! it&#x27;s a really nice dark color with a hint of purple. perfect if you like dark, but don&#x27;t want black.</li>
            <li> Upon ordering this I was expecting the polish to be black or in that close proximity but instead is a dark plum/purple color. I love the color its just not what I was expecting. Besides the color confusion the Gelish polishes are wonderful as always. Great product &amp; would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> Very nice dark purple, but not black which is great for my skin tone.  Takes a bit longer to cure (few more mins) but shining great.</li>
            <li> This product is even better than expected. Color was richer in hue then in the bottle. When applied it&#x27;s vibrant color and shine stayed for three weeks without chipping or fading. Fabulous  fall or winter color. Must be applied by a professional nail technician and cured with their special light, in order to achieve expected results.</li>
            <li> The swatch for this polish wasn&#x27;t accurate at all - the picture makes it look black!  The color is actually a deep, rich plum which was just what I was looking for (thanks other reviewers for providing clarified information regarding this color!).  It went on very smoothly, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I get lots of compliments on this color it almost black and looks great!!</li>
            <li> Lovely dark magenta purple color - much more purple than black but I really like it and it&#x27;s quite a stand out.  Lots of compliments as well and Gelish is the only way to go!</li>
            <li> who doesn&#x27;t love Bella</li>
            <li> I love, love the harmony gelish system. But I did not like this color, I thought it was going to black like it looks in picture, but on my nails it looks like a deep burgundy. Wish it was black. Will  check at Sally\\&quot;s to see if they have black. But everyone tired of spending money on getting their nails done need to get the trial kit.</li>
            <li> This seller is fine and shipping was prompt. However: the color was not what I expected. Bella&#x27;s vampire is deep purple/eggplant. If that is the color you want, order it. It is not what I was expecting and it&#x27;s too much of a hassle to send back.</li>
            <li> I, like most, spent $35 everytime I went to the salon for gel-mani.  What a waste of money &amp; time!  I LOVE Gelish and can do my own gel-mani in less than 30 min (I use the Gelish mini LED light, which takes half the drying time of the UV light).    Bella&#x27;s Vampire, beautiful burgundy color!  I would not say I see any \\&quot;purple\\&quot; once so ever.  So if your looking for a nice merlot color, this is it!</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and as stated. Color is nice. It is the color of eggplant. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This color was not toourple or light as I was worried it would be. Looks black , which was what I was going for. Only needed 2 coats. Cured in 2 minutes. I top it off with IBD clear builder gel, stronger than any other gel top coats I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The Color is way more purple than black. It goes on really nice, super shinny. I loved it. 2 coats and your done!</li>
            <li> This color is a very dark purple, almost black the more layers you add.  I had to do about 3 coats before I felt like it was evenly covered on all nails due to the fact that the thinner the layer the better staying power the polish has.  I added water field over the top for some additional sparkle. I love gelish products and they definitely last as long as they say they will when you put them on correctly.</li>
            <li> I love Gelish products but I agree that most colors in reality look different from the color pictures on their website.  I choose this color because I wanted something timeless that will work at the office, black tie events or any other social happening.  The color is pretty dark but not black, it does have a hint of red/purple but it&#x27;s very settle. I think. This color is definitely an all-rounder and a must have for every women who uses Gelish. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Perfect color for fall/winter; there is enough purple that it doesn&#x27;t look solid black and has lasted longer than most gels on my nails.</li>
            <li> Bella&#x27;s Vampire?  My daughters giggled over the name, but it&#x27;s a great color!  It&#x27;s a really, really dark purple-y grape color that looks almost black.  Lots of people have compared this to Black Cherry Berry and say that it&#x27;s the same, but it&#x27;s not.  Black Cherry Berry is clearly a really dark red, and this color is dark purple that&#x27;s pretty close to the swatch.  We painted my daughter&#x27;s nails with a layer of Vegas Nights over it and it really looks good with the glitter over top.  Love this color!</li>
            <li> I love this color! It is a deep rich black/purple. I use two coats because I don&#x27;t want any streaks.</li>
            <li> This a dark rich plummy cherry color. For dark colors keep under the lamp for 3 minutes.each coat of polish.</li>
            <li> Love this color!! By far the best gel color out there!</li>
            <li> This was the dark purple I was looking for. It actually looked decent when I applied one coat, but I wanted it darker so I applied a second. This is almost black but you can really see the plum accent coming out. I think the picture is true to the actual color and I am very happy with my purchase. Fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li> A dark, dramatic color perfect for fall/winter.  A very dark plum color with no shimmer. You may need more than two coats to achieve an even color.</li>
            <li> This color is beautiful. I absolutely love it. I love Gelish products. They are very good quality. My manicure lasts well over 2 weeks even though I was dishes daily and clean the house. Can&#x27;t go wrong with Gelish.</li>
            <li> High quality item, like it a lot</li>
            <li> This color is a really deep purple color. when you see it in the light you can see the purple coming through. great fall colorand great product.</li>
            <li> My mom and I love this color! It is dark for those of us who like the darker nail polish but you can still see that it is purple and it doesn&#x27;t look black like most purple nail polishes do. And I LOVE Gel Nail Polish!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t LOVE it.  It&#x27;s a lot more &amp;#34;black cherry&amp;#34; and not as &amp;#34;grape&amp;#34; as I wanted.  It&#x27;s hard to get a true idea of what the color will look like in person when looking at the little dot online. I&#x27;m happy with the polish, I&#x27;ll just keep looking for the &amp;#34;grape&amp;#34; color I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Love this color! It&#x27;s a very dark purpley-black - exactly like eggplant. It&#x27;s a great color, dark and rich, but not goth. Thin coats works best, as with all the colors, and two coats covered completely. Perfect!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3F82E52KYHFKS]]This is a beautiful high gloss color that looks just great on your fingernails.  My video shows the high gloss and the beautiful shinny surface.  This is also a good polish to put a coat of Waterfield onto on nail for a party nail.  Bella&#x27;s Vampire is a dark purplish red color with a lot of character.  Here is the link to the Waterfield polish:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003VMZYSC Harmony Gelish Uv Soak Off Gel Polish -Water Field (0.5 Oz)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bella&#x27;s Vampire is a larger bottle than we can find in the local beauty supply stores and it contains about 66% more for less money.  This size of bottle will do your fingernails for a long time. We got ours on Amazon.  Just remember that this is a dark color so it will take a bit more time to cure in your UV nail dryer. It is a deep, rich and dark color that you will really like.  We rated it at 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I love this color - it&#x27;s perfect. It&#x27;s not black but not red. it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted. A purplish type dark redish color. The only complaint that I have is that it&#x27;s a little thin, so you do not need much color on the brush at all. Do two light coats and you will get the results you want.</li>
            <li> Delivered very quickly. Color is not as purple as shown and you have to use 2 heavier coats. But I really like this color and have gotten many compliments. Product was very fresh. I&#x27;m going on 3 weeks and it still has not chipped. If the outgrowth didn&#x27;t show by my cuticles, I could probably go another week. Definitely would order from this company again.</li>
            <li> I love this color. Very dark purple, almost black, and so dramatic. Looks outstanding on short nails. Has good coverage on 2 coats, but like many of the dark gel colors 3 coats makes it perfect. This one is a keeper!</li>
            <li> Love this, and usually only requires 2 coats. My favorite OPI color is Lincoln After Dark and this is VERY close. So it&#x27;s great to have a gel color that I can use and pair it with my favorite OPI on my toes. ;)</li>
            <li> This is true to Eggplant color, a deep purple black. Looks great on short and long nails. I like three coats best. Gelish brand is all I&#x27;ve used in UV so far.</li>
            <li> Color is awesome. Works just as it should.  No complaints for this product at all.  Would buy again and again.</li>
            <li> This is a nice dark purple color, great for fall. I thought the consistency was fine and the color as pictured.</li>
            <li> I like putting 3 coats on but you can get away with 2. I just like the deeper color you get with an extra coat. I&#x27;ve had so many compliments while wearing this on my hands and feet. The bubble swatch of the color is very accurate in my opinion. I keep saying that I&#x27;m going to wear a new color in 2 weeks but I can&#x27;t stop wearing this one! I love it!!</li>
            <li> I love the look of the color...but when it comes to the application of it very runny and messy.  This did not happen when I purchased mint of spring.</li>
            <li> This is a really deep plum color, with redish undertone. I read a review stating that it was runny, mine was the opposite- thicker and tackier then my other Gelish colors ( Pink smoothie, Hot rod red for example). It did pull a little from the edges, so I flash cured each nail for 10 sec, prior to regular cure for each layer. Three thin layers for true depth of the color.  All the extra effort was worth it- the color is just gorgeous!  But, due to the reasons stated above, I had to take one star off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a deep dark purple it&#x27;s looks nice and twinkle and looks even better I love gelish polish it worth every penny</li>
            <li> a bit runny, but color is great,i like it.</li>
            <li> I just recently bought the Harmony Gel Nail Polish along with the foundation gel, top polish an a 36 watt UV lamp. No I&#x27;m not a licensed nail tech; however i&#x27;ve been getting my nails done for years and i was tired of paying all that money for solar nails, plus i wanted to wear my natural nails. After wearing regular polish for a day and seeing all the chips, i decided to do some research and came across the gel nail polishes. I bought this harmony gel polish and i absolutely love it. It&#x27;s been 4 days so far and no chips. I type all the time and i can be rough with my hands. Bella&#x27;s Vampire is a beautiful dark rich plum color that looks so good, and it&#x27;s so shiny. Love Love Love this system. I just ordered 4 more colors!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a dark wine color and not the dark purple I thought it would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> favorite gelish color so far. awesome for fall</li>
            <li> I like this color, sort of has a purplish tint. I wear this color often when I want to paint my nails darker.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best colors. I couldn&#x27;t believe how quickly I received the product and protected so professionally.</li>
            <li> This is a very deep, deep purple which is what I was looking for. The swatch is representative of what the color actually looks like with two coats. I use it on my fingernails with NYC&#x27;s Plaza Plumberry on my toes.</li>
            <li> The color is exactly how it looks. DEEP AND DARK.. In the light it looks like a dark grape color and inside low light almost looks black I love it! Purple is my favorite color so I bought this and other shades of Gelish purple.. all great!</li>
            <li> I love this color its dark with a purple-red tint. If not cured long enough it will come off since the color is so dark. I cure the first coat for 3 minutes then cure the second coat for 3 minutes and cure the \\&quot;top it off\\&quot; coat for 3 minutes. I used the Gelish UV mini light.</li>
            <li> The color is different when u get it. The picture looks like a different color but I kept the color because I didn&#x27;t have anything like it.</li>
            <li> Love this color!!! Beautiful dark purple/burgundy color that looks almost black indoors but a beautiful burgundy in the sun! It&#x27;s very opaque, so it only needs 2 coats, and I had no wrinkling--even with thicker coats! Great polish.</li>
            <li> I love this polish. It only took one coat to get the color I liked so this bottle should last a really long time. Quick shipping and packaged well.</li>
            <li> I have only one complaint about this product...I didn&#x27;t invent it. I love this stuff. If you haven&#x27;t tried gel polish then you dont know what you are missing. Perfect manicure and stays without chipping and it&#x27;s high gloss for weeks and I am usually a pretty busy gal and my hands see a lot of action. The best!!</li>
            <li> This color is a must have.  I&#x27;m new to the gelish family and love the Harmony products.  This is about my third time applying this product on my nails.  I give myself three coats to get full coverage of this deep reddish purple.  I can wear this color to work and out.  I would highly recommended Bella&#x27;s Vampire as a nail color staple.</li>
            <li> Very rich color..only took 2 coats ! Love the dark Vamp look !!! Cool yet sophisticated ! Perfect for Winter !</li>
            <li> This product does what it says!  As other have noted, this last more than 2 weeks and is worth every dollar.  I am happy to know that someone thought of a way to bring more versatility to nail care.</li>
            <li> I placed my order and payment, and next day was told the item was really out of stock even though it was still currently advertised as having more than twenty of the item still in stock...big disappointment</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful color. It&#x27;s sassy but kind of elegant. I don&#x27;t know that I would call it purple though. Regardless, it&#x27;s one of my favorite Gelish colors!</li>
            <li> Bella&#x27;s Vampire is a dark rich Gelish Soak Off Gel polish that stays for up to two weeks for me and I am horrible with my nail.s</li>
            <li> I originally thought this was black until I received it and it&#x27;s a super dark, matte deep red/purple. I love the color! Shipped quick and on time.</li>
            <li> I am a brand new Gelish system user.. This was the first shade I bought... I love the color and posted a pic in the customer images section.&lt;br /&gt;The system itself, if great! Even for someone that is not so good with nail polish, if you follow the steps, you will have beautiful professional looking nails.&lt;br /&gt;I love that it lasts so well that instead of chipping, only worry you have is it growing out before it has to be re-done.&lt;br /&gt;This is the first nail polish system that holds up to my every day activities and looks shiny, beautiful and professionally done.&lt;br /&gt;Im never going back to regular nail polish on my hands again :)</li>
            <li> A great Gel Polish. I love this brand.</li>
            <li> I love how dark and seductive this color is. It is more purple in the sun than you can see in the picture but still a beautiful color.</li>
            <li> this is a very pretty color. It looks really good with the color Feel Me On Your Fingertips on top.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this color. It&#x27;s a deep purple, like a wine color. It only takes a couple of coats to complete your manicure. I will be wearing this polish all winter! I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Love it :) indoors it looks black but out in the sun you can see the purple . I would definitely recommend this color if you have a gel kit</li>
            <li> Lovely dark color that is almost black in some light and a deep purple in other lights. I added a bit of pink sparkle to my ring finger and that really brought out the purple color. Just beautiful.</li>
            <li> A little too dark for my tastes.  It needs two solid coats to even out the color, and results in a nail color that is nearly black with a hint of purple.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a black, this is not it. It is a dark dark purple, still love the color.</li>
            <li> My favorite color!! Easy &amp; quick service! &amp; I&#x27;ve found more clients pick this color over all others! Love harmony gelish colors!</li>
            <li> I love love love this color!!! It is definitely my favorite!! It looks black far away but up close it&#x27;s a deep red. The name definitely suits this color.</li>
            <li> The image appears to be almost black, which is what I was expecting.  More of a deep red, pretty none the less.</li>
            <li> I have had so many complements on this polish. It was my first color I bought with the Gelish products. It is still my favorite and I always have someone commenting on it. Good, deep reddish purple in color. Fabulous!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American, and this is a very very dark purple, almost black. It was exactly what I was looking for. I&#x27;m in health care and use my hands often. This is def a color any professional can wear.</li>
            <li> This gel nailpolish is the exact color they show online.  I was quite pleased to receive my order within three days and am very pleased with how my nails turned out!!I would defiantly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My daughter ordered this product.  She loved the color and the size of the polish.</li>
            <li> I love this color. No curing issues even with the dark color. I love to apply water field over it to give it a bigger sparkle!</li>
            <li> The color is to clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not the like it seems there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually don&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not like picture, ok.</li>
            <li> Color is eggplant.  It can streak if you&#x27;re not careful when applying.  It can look a little goth, but it&#x27;s fall, so why not go dark on the nails?</li>
            <li> In dim light the color looks like black, with more light it looks like black cherry, and if you go in the sun it looks dark purple. It goes really beautifully with my rose gold wedding ring and watch. Also, I wear a lot of red, black, and white, so the color looks really lovely with most of my outfits. I resisted buying it for ages because of the corny name, but it&#x27;s really a phenomenal color. Whenever I&#x27;m wearing it I get loads of compliments.</li>
            <li> this is a near match for OPI&#x27;s Lincoln Park After Midnight (more purpely vs. black).  I like this color against my skin tone more than other darker colors out there.  Easy to use and the color will work for many more seasons to come.</li>
            <li> I love this color. My manicurist used it on me several times and I fell in love it. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This polish was too dark for my taste.  Gelish is rather hard to remove and I like CND products better.</li>
            <li> I still gave it 5 stars though because I&#x27;ve come to expect that with Gelish colors and the final color is beautiful. It looks like a dark, dark plum (almost black with purple and red tones). I love this color! I have darker skin and I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t look good against my skin, but I&#x27;m very happy with it :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I used my usual Gelish topcoat and it seems exceptionally shiny. My nails have a jewel-tone quality to it. Can&#x27;t ask for more than that!</li>
            <li> I love the color easy o put on , Love that color lady&#x27;s get it .. Most have....Bella&#x27;s Vampire! is the way to go!!!</li>
            <li> This color does actually turn out pretty close to the swatch. It is a nice, DARK, opaque purple after 2 to 3 coats. It is one of my favorite fall and winter polishes.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more of a black color, but this is very purple. I still like the color, just wish there was a better picture before purchase.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Bella&#x27;s Vampire.  It is dark... not too purple, not too black.  I am a huge fan of \\&quot;Black Berry Cherry\\&quot; and found myself wearing it almost all of the time.  I bought this hoping to find something I liked just as well.  It is beautiful!</li>
            <li> This is a deep beautiful color, almost black with purplish reddish undertones. It almost looks like a deep black cherry, just lovely.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, love it!</li>
            <li> I thought this color would be closer to black, and in dim light, it does look black. However, in the light it is a very deep plum. It is gorgeous! Can&#x27;t wait to wear it...maybe during halloween! Covered well in 2 coats.</li>
            <li> I really love this polish....the color is great and it came fast in the mail. I would recommend to all!!</li>
            <li> This color does not match what&#x27;s in the picture. I expected that, but what I did not expect was to have to use three coats of polish to get it as dark as it looks in then picture. I was expecting a almost black color with a hint of purple, but even after three coats it was just a dark purple. If I had known that I wouldn&#x27;t have brought it, it&#x27;s kind of a boring color.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it. I&#x27;m wearing it right now. Came out exactly the same color as it is on the internet. With that said, the actual color is sort of a violet, with a red base. It goes on blood red at first and by the second coat shows up as dark as you see in the thumbnail. When you hold it up to natural light it is violet- noticeably purple. Under LED light, by the time i applied a top coat (i used another brand as my top coat so this may be why the following) it appeared as a bright blue, of all things. Quite the color rollercoaster, and it seems that depending what light you hold it in, whether natural sunlight, artificial indoor light or LED light, it kinda changes, but for indoor lighting it is gonna show up almost black-looking like you see here. this is day 3 of wearing it and of course, of course, of course, not a chip in sight. but i&#x27;ve come to expect flawlessness with gel nail polish any how and now it&#x27;s all i wear. i was pleased with another of gelish&#x27;s polishes that i&#x27;d previously tried and its  truly a great deal for such consistent delivery of perfect results. Love!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful color.  It&#x27;s the only Gelish color that I have, so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a problem with the brand, but I had a very hard time applying this polish because it was so runny and thin.  I did 3 very thin coats and had a lot of trouble with the color leaching into the crack between my nail and finger, which was impossible to prevent or correct.  The good news is that, after working with it for hours, my hard work paid off in the end because my manicure still looked perfect after two weeks.  I think I&#x27;ll try another color and see if I just got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> I really do like it, a black purple but I really wasn&#x27;t expecting it to have such a red undertone.  Even though it wasn&#x27;t exactly the color I had thought it was it has gotten me many compliments.</li>
            <li> Very nice winter color.</li>
            <li> This color is absolutely beautiful!!! I wear it constantly!! Its such a dark color that it goes with anything. Its a deep eggplant purple/Burgundy. I love it</li>
            <li> This color resembles OPI&#x27;s famous Lincoln Park after Dark nail color. Absolutely fabulous. Make sure you do not put it on too thick as it will peel. But that is the rule with all of the Gel polish. Must have color for everyone.</li>
            <li> In the light it shines to a deep red bloody purple color. Without the light it looks almost black. great polish</li>
            <li> Great price for FULL SIZE! Stores will usually sell the MINI version for about the same, or for even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shade: the perfect burgundy shade&lt;br /&gt;  -not too purplish&lt;br /&gt;  -not too red&lt;br /&gt;  -2 coats gives the perfect amount of dark tone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reference to : Sally Hansen - Wholesome Earth, Essie - Devil&#x27;s Advocate&lt;br /&gt;  **If this is the tone of burgundy that you like, this color is the one.</li>
            <li> it could pass for black but it has a slight purple/deep red hue to it. Very pretty color and this brand is great quality</li>
            <li> Every time I cure my nails on the last step (top coat) my nail polish shrinks so much at the tip of my nails so it looks like I have reversed french tip it is NOT cute. No matter which top coat (gel) I use in conjunction to this Bella&#x27;s Vampire gel nail I bought from seller HARMONY, it keeps shrinking! Also, the polish is so so watery it bleeds onto my nail beds it&#x27;s very irritating to have to clean up each swatch. My one star review is for the polish, NOT for the seller.</li>
