            <li>This is the most effective degreasing shampoo I&#x27;ve come across and the cheapest.  </li>
            <li>this is a nice product we took it many time try it..</li>

            <li>Shampoo is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I have oily hair and love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I am completely in love with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is excellent too, only need to use the tiniest bit to get good results, so in the end it is quite economical.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this at the health store where I get my vitamins.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lovin it! :)</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re okay.  </li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I used to have a good amount of oil built up by the time I got home from work and this product really has done the job.</li>
            <li>From all other brands she has tried, this one is the one that feels the best for her, as it leaves the hair feeling light and clean!</li>
            <li>The lemon I am reviewing has a bit of a strong smell but it doesn&#x27;t bother me and doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li>and I have fine hair.</li>
            <li>This Lemon shampoo was more then adequate to remove the oil off my scalp.  </li>
            <li>In Texas the summers get very hot and our scalps tend to sweat alot which causes even more issues with oil.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product, it really cleans your scalp and hair, clears out oily residues and leaves basically a great looking long lasting healthy hair.</li>
            <li>Initially it was great.  </li>
            <li>This one is just more economical.</li>
            <li>Have been looking for sometime a shampoo which is sulfate free and will handle oily</li>
            <li>This is by far the best shampoo I&#x27;ve found for my very fine, flat, straight, oily hair.</li>
            <li>The quality and the quantity are good enough to go for it.</li>
            <li>My teen daughter has oily hair and this is her very favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>And even on the third day it still looks pretty good.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used other products with the oil in it and it creates a pleasant tingling on the scalp.     </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Use it every other day, leaves my hair looking gorgeous the day it&#x27;s washed and for the day after</li>
            <li>Right after the wash, my hair looks</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t need much of it to get my hair clean, so it also lasts longer than everything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t complain too much about having a full head of thinner-than-it-used-to-be hair.</li>
            <li>It cleans thoroughly but gently, and smells like fresh lemons.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate their customer care!.</li>
            <li>My 15 yr old  son uses this shampoo and absolutely loves it!!!</li>
            <li>There is one other shampoo tat work a little better that I found so far, but this one is very good as well.</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY shampoo I&#x27;ve been able to use that not only fights the oil but leaves my scalp feeling happy and not angry and itchy like a lot of other shampoos claiming to be for oily hair.</li>
            <li>I bought some of their coconut shampoo which was ok, but left too much oil in my hair.</li>
            <li>also got overzealous and ordered the 3-pack, assuming that it was going to work wonders after reading all of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I both have very oily scalps.</li>
            <li>Not only did I recieve the product that I paid for, but it was a hassle free experience.</li>
            <li>I REALLY WANTED TO TRY THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>I have very oily hair.</li>
            <li>Finally, this company doesn&#x27;t solicit a free trial shampoo for your review.  </li>
            <li>We did not have any issues with our scalps becoming too dry.</li>
            <li>Not only does it keep my hair clean, but it is also helping to control my oily hair.  </li>
            <li>we are going to buy more later on in the future</li>
            <li>It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, clean your hair and leave it less oily.</li>
            <li>The only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars was, because unlike the conditioner this doesn&#x27;t have a really lemony smell</li>
            <li>People are compromised easily, whether slightly or egregiously, by such propositions, and I distrust both the reviewers and the company in those cases.  </li>
            <li>i was drawn to this product because it didn&#x27;t have chemicals, and I have had previous success with tea tree oil and lemon.  </li>
            <li>Direct Super Center is a rip off!!!!  </li>
            <li>I usually have to wash it twice to get it really clean.  </li>
            <li>I like this brand in general.</li>
            <li>I like to follow that up with a regular shampoo, sometimes with conditioner, to keep my hair soft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week, so can&#x27;t attest to the long term benefits of tea tree oil on my oily scalp, but so far I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s not the miracle I was hoping for, but I can go two solid days without washing my hair, three with a little dry shampoo if it&#x27;s not too hot out.</li>
            <li> I really like it, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much Tea Tree Oil is actually in the product.  </li>
            <li> Works as long as I mix it up every once in a while and use a different shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have tried other shampoos by the same company, such as the \\&quot;Pure\\&quot; and \\&quot;Raspberry\\&quot; varieties.  </li>
            <li> The other one I mentioned liming is a bit more expensive.</li>
            <li> After two months, my hair was so dry, it felt like straw.  </li>
            <li> But ordering multipacks brings the price down to what I was paying locally (around $7-$9 per bottle).</li>
            <li> For treating oily hair, though, it&#x27;s not particularly effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have moderately greasy hair, not super greasy like Bowzer or your trailer park mechanic.  </li>
            <li> BTW the lemon scent is rated less overall toxic than the coconut scent which I prefer.</li>
            <li> I never really look at their products but.</li>
            <li> To test this I swapped it out and replaced it with my regular Neutrogena anti - residue shampoo for a few days and my itchiness was gone.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t the cheapest product around but a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Between that and not having to use conditioner, this is not as expensive as it would at first seem.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suggest using a pair of scissors or a sharp knife to enlarge the hole a bit.     </li>
            <li> That sounds excessive, but I&#x27;ve yet to see another degreaser last longer than 8 hours.  </li>
            <li> Other degreasers sell for $15 - $20 for just one 8-oz bottle.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely oily hair.</li>
            <li> I can confirm with the other reviewer that this product while works well with oily hairs, it does cause some itchiness.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks, my hair started feeling dryer and rough.  </li>
            <li> I have used half a bottle now, and it works for my oily hair.</li>
            <li> I think it is a little overkill.</li>
            <li> The other reviewer was correct in saying that the hole in the bottle was too small to get the product out.  </li>
            <li> The tube is not easy to use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this shampoo a few times and this past purchase</li>
            <li> It was a mess of peeling skin and little bloody spots where he had been itching so much.  </li>
            <li> It is a little hard to get out of the tube, but I think that&#x27;s because the opening is so small.</li>
            <li> organic shampoos leave my hair limp and dull looking.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping that with this shampoo, I could go about 2 days without having to wash my hair (instead of having to wash it every day like I usually have to).</li>
            <li> typically have thin, chin-length, oily hair.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s surprisingly hard to squeeze out a lot at once.</li>
            <li> She has thick hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked that Amazon.com allows a company like this on their site.</li>
            <li> The price on Amazon 9now about $26 for a 3 pack) is outrageous - I just bought a bottle for &lt;$4.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I bought a pack of 3. I have used half a bottle now, and it works for my oily hair. I like it and I will keep using it!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this shampoo. It&#x27;s great for anyone that has oily hair.  The only problem I&#x27;ve had is after I&#x27;ve shampooed I have a problem getting a comb through my hair even with conditioner.</li>
            <li> Shampoo is fantastic!  Works wonderful on oily hair.  Just don&#x27;t buy from this company.  The item says in stock, but it&#x27;s not.  Direct Super Center is a rip off!!!!  I&#x27;m shocked that Amazon.com allows a company like this on their site.</li>
            <li> I have oily hair and love this shampoo.  It works great - cleans well and controls the oil throughout the day.  The price on Amazon 9now about $26 for a 3 pack) is outrageous - I just bought a bottle for &lt;$4.  Definitely will continue to buy - but not from here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Desert Essence&#x27; Lemon Tea Tree Shampoo for about 3 years now. I love it. I have oily, tangly hair and with just the shampoo (no conditioner) my hair is cleansed and detangled. I have not had to use conditioner since I started using this shampoo. I have oily hair but using this, I can go for 48 hours without washing. Between that and not having to use conditioner, this is not as expensive as it would at first seem.    My only problem is that I can no longer get it locally and have to order it on Amazon. But ordering multipacks brings the price down to what I was paying locally (around $7-$9 per bottle).</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a perfect fix for my oily hair and my husbands dandruff.  I usually have to wash it twice to get it really clean.  Initially it was great.  Lathered well and cleaned well.  Smelled wonderful.  After a few weeks, my hair started feeling dryer and rough.  After two months, my hair was so dry, it felt like straw.  Coincidentally, my husband asked me one night to look at his head because it kept itching while he was at work.  It was a mess of peeling skin and little bloody spots where he had been itching so much.  We have stopped using it, and the itchiness is starting to go away.  I&#x27;m not sure how much Tea Tree Oil is actually in the product.  We&#x27;ve used other products with the oil in it and it creates a pleasant tingling on the scalp.     I have tried other shampoos by the same company, such as the \\&quot;Pure\\&quot; and \\&quot;Raspberry\\&quot; varieties.  I really liked them a lot and would recommend all the others.  Burt&#x27;s Bees and Avalon Organics Lavender shampoo are my favorites too.  This Lemon shampoo was more then adequate to remove the oil off my scalp.  I think it is a little overkill. The other reviewer was correct in saying that the hole in the bottle was too small to get the product out.  I remedied that by enlarging it with the tip of my meat thermometer.</li>
            <li> As a shampoo- it works fine and smells great. For treating oily hair, though, it&#x27;s not particularly effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically have thin, chin-length, oily hair. I was hoping that with this shampoo, I could go about 2 days without having to wash my hair (instead of having to wash it every day like I usually have to). No luck. Right after the wash, my hair looks great- but about 10 or so hours and my hair is already back to looking oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also got overzealous and ordered the 3-pack, assuming that it was going to work wonders after reading all of the positive reviews. So maybe spring for the 1, see if it works, then go for the bundle once you confirm for yourself.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, it really cleans your scalp and hair, clears out oily residues and leaves basically a great looking long lasting healthy hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both have very oily scalps. She has thick hair and I have fine hair. In Texas the summers get very hot and our scalps tend to sweat alot which causes even more issues with oil. This shampoo worked well for us. The price was good as well. There is one other shampoo tat work a little better that I found so far, but this one is very good as well. We did not have any issues with our scalps becoming too dry. We will order it again. The other one I mentioned liming is a bit more expensive. This one is just more economical.</li>
            <li> I am completely in love with this shampoo. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week, so can&#x27;t attest to the long term benefits of tea tree oil on my oily scalp, but so far I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. It cleans thoroughly but gently, and smells like fresh lemons. Lathers wonderfully.    It is a little hard to get out of the tube, but I think that&#x27;s because the opening is so small. I&#x27;d suggest using a pair of scissors or a sharp knife to enlarge the hole a bit.     The conditioner is excellent too, only need to use the tiniest bit to get good results, so in the end it is quite economical.</li>
            <li> Works as long as I mix it up every once in a while and use a different shampoo.</li>
            <li> These tubes leak and it&#x27;s surprisingly hard to squeeze out a lot at once. Otherwise it&#x27;s good shampoo.</li>
            <li> Dries out my hair but works great. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks now and have noticed my hair doesn&#x27;t get as greasy the next day . Use a good conditioner</li>
            <li> This is the only thing I have ever found that works on my oily hair. If I use anything else I end up with greasy patches at my temples after 12 hours. This stuff actually fixes it.</li>
            <li> Got rid of the oil in hair! The tube is not easy to use so I put in a bottle. One tube last about a month and I use it every night.</li>
            <li> I found this product locally for $8 a tube. Not only did I recieve the product that I paid for, but it was a hassle free experience. Unlike my issue w CB SELECT...who said they&#x27;d reship, then kept me waiting. Had I not opted to file a claim, Id probaly still be waiting. lol What I love about this shampoo. I REALLY WANTED TO TRY THIS PRODUCT and I used it twice today. You know shower before work wakes me up, shower in evening helps me sleep because I&#x27;m clean and feeling good! I have very oily hair. I shower and towards the end of the day...hair starts looking a tad shabby. I&#x27;m so glad I found this at the health store where I get my vitamins. I never really look at their products but. I was browsing while my bro picked up some vitamins for himself. I saw some lavender shampoo but it was this brand that caught my eye because its what I wanted . I like the way my hair looks today. Please keep in mind I just got the product, but ...I&#x27;m lovin it! :)</li>
            <li> Wonderful aroma, does the job, reasonable price... what else to say.. ah, RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> I have the oiliest hair and skin on the planet. Have tried MANY shampoos &amp;#34;for oily hair&amp;#34; and some have been adequate, but this one is THE BEST. My hair looks really great after shampooing, and the look lasts longer than any oily hair I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shampoo I&#x27;ve found for my very fine, flat, straight, oily hair. It&#x27;s not the miracle I was hoping for, but I can go two solid days without washing my hair, three with a little dry shampoo if it&#x27;s not too hot out. And even on the third day it still looks pretty good. It smells nice and I don&#x27;t need much of it to get my hair clean, so it also lasts longer than everything else I&#x27;ve tried. Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Good product  Would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on oily hair. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the most effective degreasing shampoo I&#x27;ve come across and the cheapest.  Great combination in a product.  I have moderately greasy hair, not super greasy like Bowzer or your trailer park mechanic.  I do two applications per shower.  I find that I need the second to reach the effectiveness I desire.  I like to follow that up with a regular shampoo, sometimes with conditioner, to keep my hair soft.  The effect will last about 10 hours.  You can shower in the morning, go to work and come home -- and you&#x27;re okay.  If you go out at night, you&#x27;ll need to degrease again if you&#x27;re like me.  That sounds excessive, but I&#x27;ve yet to see another degreaser last longer than 8 hours.  As for the price, you can get a total of 24 ounces (3 8-oz bottles) for twenty or twenty one bucks.  Other degreasers sell for $15 - $20 for just one 8-oz bottle.  Finally, this company doesn&#x27;t solicit a free trial shampoo for your review.  People are compromised easily, whether slightly or egregiously, by such propositions, and I distrust both the reviewers and the company in those cases.  This company is standing on its merits, here, on amazon.  And I think this shampoo merits 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  Have been looking for sometime a shampoo which is sulfate free and will handle oily hair.&lt;br /&gt;Most organic shampoos leave my hair limp and dull looking.  This works great and leaves my hair shiny as well.</li>
            <li> The only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars was, because unlike the conditioner this doesn&#x27;t have a really lemony smell but, it does work great for oily hair.</li>
            <li> i was drawn to this product because it didn&#x27;t have chemicals, and I have had previous success with tea tree oil and lemon.  Not only does it keep my hair clean, but it is also helping to control my oily hair.  It isn&#x27;t the cheapest product around but a little goes a long way.  It&#x27;s well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Works great, smells even better!</li>
            <li> Use it every other day, leaves my hair looking gorgeous the day it&#x27;s washed and for the day after</li>
            <li> this is a nice product we took it many time try it..we are going to buy more later on in the future</li>
            <li> My teen daughter has oily hair and this is her very favorite shampoo. From all other brands she has tried, this one is the one that feels the best for her, as it leaves the hair feeling light and clean!</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily hair. This is the ONLY shampoo I&#x27;ve been able to use that not only fights the oil but leaves my scalp feeling happy and not angry and itchy like a lot of other shampoos claiming to be for oily hair. I&#x27;ve bought this shampoo a few times and this past purchase I ordered the 3 pack to stock up. I&#x27;m a customer for life.</li>
            <li> Perfect for oily hair.</li>
            <li> I got this looking for an organic shampoo with tea tree oil to see if it would help remove excess oil from my scalp... which it does seem to do. My hair is still a bit thinner up there than I&#x27;d like, but I&#x27;m 10+ years beyond the age where the men in my mom&#x27;s family were totally bald so I can&#x27;t complain too much about having a full head of thinner-than-it-used-to-be hair.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, clean your hair and leave it less oily. I used to have a good amount of oil built up by the time I got home from work and this product really has done the job.</li>
            <li> I can confirm with the other reviewer that this product while works well with oily hairs, it does cause some itchiness.  To test this I swapped it out and replaced it with my regular Neutrogena anti - residue shampoo for a few days and my itchiness was gone.</li>
            <li> I bought some of their coconut shampoo which was ok, but left too much oil in my hair. If you have oily hair try this one. I really like it, and a little goes a long way. I use it all the time now. And they are organic, good stuff! Try it, you&#x27;ll like it. Just remember this is for oily hair.</li>
            <li> My 15 yr old  son uses this shampoo and absolutely loves it!!! Great job on oily hair types.&lt;br /&gt;Great product</li>
            <li> I really appreciate their customer care!. The are awesome. The quality and the quantity are good enough to go for it.</li>
            <li> I use this scent for dandruff control because it has tea tree oil in it. I alternate between this scent and the coconut. The lemon I am reviewing has a bit of a strong smell but it doesn&#x27;t bother me and doesn&#x27;t linger. BTW the lemon scent is rated less overall toxic than the coconut scent which I prefer. I checked it on the skindeep website. I like this brand in general.</li>
