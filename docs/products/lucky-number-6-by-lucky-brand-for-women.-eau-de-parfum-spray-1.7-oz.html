            <li>I was very happy I was able to find this perfume and will be ordering it again in the future.</li>
            <li>Mostly for me is one of those go-to when everything else seems either too elegant or too sporty.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not obnoxious like most perfumes are</li>
            <li>When I smelled this scent in the store, I thought it seemed nice, but nothing special.  </li>
            <li>I just figured if I liked the women&#x27;s version, I would like the guys version, and it had a cool box.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells, but sometimes it can be too strong and will irritate my nose all day.</li>
            <li>She can&#x27;t find it in the stores any more, but it&#x27;s her absolute favorite!</li>
            <li>Its not too strong.</li>
            <li>This was a great deal and we enjoyed the fresh and clean scent which was not sweet or too perfumy, very nice.</li>
            <li>My doctor&#x27;s office is fragrance free.</li>
            <li>It have exotic undertones with a fresh clinch, yes I would buy it again.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this perfume just to get the free bag that came with it</li>
            <li>Original.</li>
            <li>Original packaging</li>
            <li>, is it bothering you?&amp;#34; They tell me just the opposite, that it&#x27;s very light and smells nice, and they want to know where I get it.</li>
            <li>I stole a spritz before wrapping it up and it&#x27;s a clean, feminine scent.</li>
            <li>(this was a special that was going on at the time).  </li>
            <li>A generous spritz in the morning will last me a good 8 hours.</li>
            <li>Cool bottle design and beaded cord.</li>
            <li>but I love this so much</li>
            <li>wonderful fragrance, i just finished my first bottle, that was a gift, this product is hard to find in stories</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great everyday perfume</li>
            <li>thought this smelt better , smells like old lady musk..</li>
            <li>The bottle is a soft, frosted glass with cute cherry blossom details.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite fragrances - light floral scent lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>great long lastly fragrance.</li>
            <li>I was in the hospital the first time I spelled it a nurse walked in and</li>
            <li>should read my first review elsewhere )</li>
            <li>i love this perfume, so you can imagine my disapointment when i finally recieved it and it didnt work.</li>
            <li>I wear it all the time because after all, life is short. :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very fresh smelling, and it is unique; slightly musky, but in a light way.  </li>
            <li>it too much</li>
            <li>Comes fast</li>
            <li>This was shipped quickly and I received it within several days of ordering.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>The Oriental-looking bottle is cute, too, and comes with a little charm that you remove in order to spray the perfume, then replace it after spraying.</li>
            <li>but i fixed it</li>
            <li>The scent is floral with woody notes so it doesn&#x27;t smell like an old lady perfume.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the only perfume I ever bought that doesn&#x27;t aggravate my husbands allergies, which is really saying something.</li>
            <li>I usually save perfume for special occasions</li>
            <li>I have an older bottle that is almost empty that I bought from Macys and this stuff is the same.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is perfectly delicate and very sensual and works well with my natural ph.</li>

            <li> Arrived broken but i fixed it my mom loves the smell everyone else does too excellent product</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. I get compliments all the time. The price was phenomenal. I highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite fragrances - light floral scent lasts a long time. Seller shipped it quickly - great buy!</li>
            <li> The perfume is packaged perfectly. Original. I love the smell. Its not too strong.</li>

            <li> I get so many compliments when I wear this fragrance. My doctor&#x27;s office is fragrance free. I had an appointment after work and forgot I had it on. I apologized but was told my the nurse that the fragrance I had on was actually very nice.</li>
            <li> great long lastly fragrance. It have exotic undertones with a fresh clinch, yes I would buy it again. Hope you like it too,</li>
            <li> Wonderfully spicy fragrance, very appealing. It doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like on my skin though. Besides that, I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I was in the hospital the first time I spelled it a nurse walked in and I loved her perfume, I just had to ask what it was! When I got home I ordered not only some for myself, but some for my Honey as well. It wasn&#x27;t even for any ocassion. I just figured if I liked the women&#x27;s version, I would like the guys version, and it had a cool box. I also love the bottle mine came in. I will get it again.</li>
            <li> thought this smelt better , smells like old lady musk.. but i guess for 12 bucks  its an ok GIFT??</li>
            <li> A lot of people ask me what I&#x27;m wearing when I use this fragrance. I use it because I just can&#x27;t tolerate smelling most colognes on myself after 2 hours, but this one smells  pleasant to me all day. My patients ask me about the fragrance and I always ask, &amp;#34;Is it too much, is it bothering you?&amp;#34; They tell me just the opposite, that it&#x27;s very light and smells nice, and they want to know where I get it.This is a nice size for putting in my bag. A generous spritz in the morning will last me a good 8 hours. It has not stained my clothes.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes. It smells nice and is inexpensive.</li>
            <li> My mom loves this perfume so I buy her a few every couple of months.  She can&#x27;t find it in the stores any more, but it&#x27;s her absolute favorite!</li>
            <li> Love It !!! Comes fast</li>
            <li> This Perfume is Awesome☆☆☆▪▪</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my &amp;#34;hippie&amp;#34; mom. She loves wrap sandals, pichouli (is that how it&#x27;s spelled?) and Steve Miller Band. And now she loves this! I stole a spritz before wrapping it up and it&#x27;s a clean, feminine scent. The bottle is a soft, frosted glass with cute cherry blossom details. Great price for an authentic perfume.</li>
            <li> I Love the scent of it and had a lot of compliments from males and females alike.AWESOME!!!! perfume love it!!!</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Had it years ago and wanted it again. It isn&#x27;t weak or anything. Smells great. Original packaging</li>
            <li> I originally bought this perfume just to get the free bag that came with it (this was a special that was going on at the time).  When I smelled this scent in the store, I thought it seemed nice, but nothing special.  After I got home with the perfume and wore it a few times, I was hooked!  I soon realized that I really love this perfume.  It&#x27;s a great everyday perfume - you can wear it during the day or at night.  It&#x27;s very fresh smelling, and it is unique; slightly musky, but in a light way.  The Oriental-looking bottle is cute, too, and comes with a little charm that you remove in order to spray the perfume, then replace it after spraying.</li>
            <li> Love it for the price- can&#x27;t be beat. Cool bottle design and beaded cord.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells, but sometimes it can be too strong and will irritate my nose all day.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift and not sealed in celephane as told it would be. Will not order from you again.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A FAKE DOES NOT EVEN SMELL LIKE IT HORRIBLE PRODUCT ITS A SHAME CAUSE I LOVE THIS PERFUME NO WONDER WHY IT WAS ONLY $10 SAVE YOUR MONEY DO NOT BUY FROM THIS VENDOR!!!FAKE</li>
            <li> wonderful fragrance, i just finished my first bottle, that was a gift, this product is hard to find in stories</li>
            <li> I was nervous when I read that this wasn&#x27;t the actual stuff but when it arrived, it was. I have an older bottle that is almost empty that I bought from Macys and this stuff is the same. I was very happy I was able to find this perfume and will be ordering it again in the future.</li>
            <li> smells like chemicals</li>
            <li> I liked this perfume alot and so does my daughter.  I would not say we will specifically go out and repurchase this unless it is on sale.  This was a great deal and we enjoyed the fresh and clean scent which was not sweet or too perfumy, very nice.</li>
            <li> This fragrance you either love or hate. I hate it at first(you should read my first review elsewhere ) Now i like it a lot... maybe my body chemistry has changed because it happened with other fragrances as well.&lt;br /&gt;I happen to like it as a winter scent. Mostly for me is one of those go-to when everything else seems either too elegant or too sporty.</li>
            <li> Like this scent for summer</li>
            <li> i love this perfume, so you can imagine my disapointment when i finally recieved it and it didnt work. the cap must be defective. it does not spray at all. complete waste of money. :(</li>
            <li> This fragrance is perfectly delicate and very sensual and works well with my natural ph. The scent is floral with woody notes so it doesn&#x27;t smell like an old lady perfume. It&#x27;s not obnoxious like most perfumes are and it&#x27;s the only perfume I ever bought that doesn&#x27;t aggravate my husbands allergies, which is really saying something. I usually save perfume for special occasions but I love this so much I wear it all the time because after all, life is short. :)</li>
