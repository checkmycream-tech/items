    <ol>
            <li>They&#x27;re perfect to put in your purse or your car.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li>These files are great !  </li>
            <li>The patterns I received were very cute :D</li>
            <li>Happy with the amount of files offered and as well as the price.</li>
            <li>Worked great as gifts for a nail kit.</li>
            <li>The quality is great and each file was wrapped in plastic</li>
            <li>She loved the patterns and board quality.</li>
            <li>Ok, you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li>This cute item to add to my good bags for my spa parties.</li>
            <li>the file shredded and was very cheaply constructed.  </li>
            <li>all in all they weren&#x27;t so good for what I needed them for but good for my 9 year old!</li>
            <li>This is a great deal if you know how much they cost at a beauty supply.  </li>
            <li>I love these emery files.</li>
            <li>For me, bigger is better and they handle toe nails (and yes my boxer&#x27;s nails) wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I was hoping better quality.</li>
            <li>awesome nail files for younger girls</li>
            <li>If, like myself you have short stubs, but do you&#x27;re best to be some type of beauty queen, then save your $ and buy one quality file!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I would purchase again even though they look really cute.</li>
            <li>These were ok for just real nails but not so good for acrylics.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They come in really cute designs and work just fine.  </li>
            <li>so it really doesn&#x27;t file as good as it should.</li>
            <li>These files are very good shape, pretty color, but the quality is so low, they don&#x27;t even file the nails.</li>
            <li>You actually get more designs that aren&#x27;t shown in the picture which is ok because they&#x27;re all still cute.</li>
            <li>We are worth it, after all!</li>
            <li>Plus if you rinse to clean, they disintegrate.</li>
            <li>The patterns are really cute and they most definitely serve their purpose as nail files</li>
            <li>I like to give a little something away to new clients that come in and get their nails done and these are perfect!</li>
            <li>They are all pretty neat!</li>
            <li>The are inexpensive and far more durable then the boards I buy in the drug store.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re only around $2 (for 5 of them which is super cheap !)</li>
            <li>So,  if you have nice long nails &amp; you can use the sides of the board, these see the files for you!  </li>
            <li>Wish they mixed these up better, but they do the job they are meant to do, and that&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
            <li>I recommend this highly!</li>
            <li>These nail files are cheaply made and do not last.  </li>
            <li>so I went for it, but you really do get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>Nice looking but mostly smooth surface makes these files pretty useless.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think much of files before I thought they are pretty much equal.  </li>
            <li>so they re definitely new.</li>
            <li>I liked the jumbo size, however, the filing colored paper was peeling off only after a few uses.</li>
            <li>The overall reviews were positive</li>
            <li>Normally I can use an emery board a few times before they lose all of their grit, but these lose their grit immediately and I&#x27;m constantly looking for a fresh spot to file my nails.  </li>
            <li>They were just pretty little paper things.  </li>

            <li> I like to give a little something away to new clients that come in and get their nails done and these are perfect! You actually get more designs that aren&#x27;t shown in the picture which is ok because they&#x27;re all still cute. They&#x27;re perfect to put in your purse or your car. And you can&#x27;t beat the price! They are all pretty neat!</li>
            <li> These nail files are individually wrapped.  They come in really cute designs and work just fine.  This is a great deal if you know how much they cost at a beauty supply.  I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> I love these emery files. The are inexpensive and far more durable then the boards I buy in the drug store. For me, bigger is better and they handle toe nails (and yes my boxer&#x27;s nails) wonderfully. I recommend this highly! 5 Stars!</li>

            <li> These are the worst files I have ever bought.  I didn&#x27;t think much of files before I thought they are pretty much equal.  These didn&#x27;t even have any sand like texture to them.  They were just pretty little paper things.  Worthless....</li>
            <li> I was hoping better quality. I liked the jumbo size, however, the filing colored paper was peeling off only after a few uses. Don&#x27;t buy it and save your monies.</li>
            <li> Happy with the amount of files offered and as well as the price. This cute item to add to my good bags for my spa parties.</li>
            <li> These nail files are cheaply made and do not last.  Normally I can use an emery board a few times before they lose all of their grit, but these lose their grit immediately and I&#x27;m constantly looking for a fresh spot to file my nails.  Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> This 6 pack lasted my wife almost 2 years! She loved the patterns and board quality.</li>
            <li> Got the same ones in the picture. Worked great as gifts for a nail kit. awesome nail files for younger girls</li>
            <li> Ok, you get what you pay for!, they are inexpensively made, the actual file paper lifts from the cardboard frame as you&#x27;re filig, the edges become unuseable almost immediately.  So,  if you have nice long nails &amp; you can use the sides of the board, these see the files for you!  If, like myself you have short stubs, but do you&#x27;re best to be some type of beauty queen, then save your $ and buy one quality file!  We are worth it, after all!</li>
            <li> The overall reviews were positive so I went for it, but you really do get what you pay for.  I couldn&#x27;t even get through filing my 10 fingernails.....the file shredded and was very cheaply constructed.  It is like a piece of notebook paper glued on to look like nail files.  I would give these to my nieces if they worked....but they&#x27;re garbage.  Into the trash.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This product has a thin coating over it so it really doesn&#x27;t file as good as it should. I don&#x27;t think I would purchase again even though they look really cute.</li>
            <li> These files are great !  They&#x27;re only around $2 (for 5 of them which is super cheap !) The patterns are really cute and they most definitely serve their purpose as nail files (: ! Although one little comment would be that the patterns on the file I received were different than the ones in the picture. I was kinda hoping to get the leopard print one but oh well. The patterns I received were very cute :D The quality is great and each file was wrapped in plastic so they re definitely new.</li>
            <li> Nice looking but mostly smooth surface makes these files pretty useless. Plus if you rinse to clean, they disintegrate. I&#x27;m back looking for another file/set.</li>
            <li> I used these for stocking stuffers and tied onto some other presents.  Everyone loves them and said it is always something they need but do not always buy for themselves.</li>
