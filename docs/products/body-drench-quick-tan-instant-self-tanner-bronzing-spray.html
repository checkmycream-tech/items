            <li>However, for a &amp;#34;Medium/Dark&amp;#34; tanning product, I&#x27;d say it should be labeled as &amp;#34;Medium&amp;#34; at best.</li>

            <li>Color turns out really good.</li>
            <li>It works great, no smudges, easy to apply!</li>
            <li>This is the best tanning spray ever, colors immediately, with no stickiness and dries quickly, and smells like vanilla.</li>
            <li>This is the best quick tan</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, just make sure you are in the shower</li>
            <li>and I heard so many great things from clients that I bought a bottle at work to try for myself.</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>The color is great not orangie goes on easy, just wear gloves to rub on skin or your palms will be funky orange.</li>
            <li>a comfy with amazing color</li>
            <li>This product is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>this product is really nice not orange at all</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s how nice the color is it  glows on its own))))NATURAL</li>
            <li>This tanner is meant to be a temporary, one day tan, which would work if you&#x27;re just spot treating your arms or legs to look nice with an outfit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also smells nice and moisturizes my face.  </li>
            <li>Nice, even, effortless, application.</li>
            <li>Also it smells really nice (vanilla/almondy).</li>
            <li>I had to spray three times to even tab bit of nice color, and still I felt that it was&lt;br</li>
            <li>Goes on nicely and evenly.</li>
            <li>I really liked this self-tan.</li>
            <li>IT WAS NICE BROWN</li>
            <li>Nice color but washes off if you shower to often</li>
            <li>It smelled nice and gave a really nice color.</li>
            <li>Great for a quick burst of color.</li>
            <li>My friend has a much paler complexion and it looks very good on him as well.</li>
            <li>I continue to use it because it by far gives the best results of any self-tanner I have tried.</li>
            <li>This is by far THE BEST self tanning spray ever!</li>
            <li>I have tried all types of sunless tanners from mousse to lotion, and this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>Goes on easily!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and gives an even glow!</li>
            <li>love this product I will be ordering more.  </li>
            <li>And it instantly gives you a flawless glow!</li>
            <li>I just ordered three more cans.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure with practice I will get better.</li>
            <li>I thought the color was ok.</li>
            <li>This time it came in a bag and both cans had the top and the nozzle off</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not a terrible product, just not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I mostly just use it on my legs.</li>
            <li>It is more of a red-ish tint.  </li>
            <li>and I sprayed this on top.  </li>
            <li>I have not found a better product YET.</li>
            <li>I work with many ladies who also now use it, and swear by it.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Love product, will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It was more of a brown.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and then having to wash them, then maybe it would be better.</li>
            <li>I have used much better self tanners.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you exfoliate before using it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>but once I did, I love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It did not color me orange, and has a much better fragrance than most tanning products.</li>
            <li>This is the best I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different brands.</li>
            <li>worked nice and smooth on my face but</li>
            <li>I love the color I get from this product.  </li>
            <li>The tan that I got out of this was, for lack of a better word, translucent.</li>
            <li>I love the way it looks and smells.  </li>
            <li>I use it after exfoliating in the shower on my face, neck, and shoulders mostly.  </li>
            <li>then most spray tan bottles out there.</li>
            <li>I love it and will keep ordering.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great but very blotchy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>its a nice golden, warm and rich looking tan.</li>
            <li>Easy to use not a fan of the smell but not terrible</li>
            <li>Great color and looks natural!</li>
            <li>Perfect and pretty natural.</li>
            <li>It is a nice golden brown.</li>
            <li>Sprays on easily.</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;CT.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you are holding it almost a full arms length from your body.</li>
            <li>It is hands down the best spray tanner out there, and I have tried them ALL.  </li>
            <li>But in a pinch for a quick tan, this will do OK.</li>
            <li>Because you will get pregnant and die!</li>
            <li>just wash your hands quick after applying!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few products and I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li>Others said, &amp;#34;spray lightly</li>
            <li>It creates a very natural looking tan, has a nice fine mist, sprays in every direction, and smells like what I call &amp;#34;tropical chocolate&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>So worth it!</li>
            <li>It puts out a super fine mist</li>
            <li>Second best thus far is this spray.</li>
            <li>But be advised, you&#x27;ll have to clean your shower immediately afterward.</li>
            <li>Read all the reviews, was super excited about this product.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a nice, even, sun kissed glow, do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying this for over 4 years, I love this tanning product so much.</li>
            <li>This is a good value and I am a big fan.</li>
            <li>ok I ordered this quick tan for two reasons 1st the price was very good,, 2nd of all it didn&#x27;t ship from china((((didn&#x27;t want to wait that long .it came on time.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as great as what other reviewers said.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been to hell and back with tanning sprays for many many years.</li>
            <li>I would use this again for a quick spot treat, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li>Just a quick spray does the job.</li>
            <li>The spray dries quickly so that you don&#x27;t feel greasy all day.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended :-)</li>
            <li>My shower was clean to start with, so this just rinsed right off the walls.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many tanners and I always come back to this one because It&#x27;s so natural looking and smells good.</li>
            <li>REALLY!!</li>
            <li>THIS S THE FIRST TANNING SPRAY THAT DIDN&#x27;T LEAVE MY SKIN ORANGE !  </li>
            <li>Gave just the right color, dries quickly.</li>
            <li>For $10 it&#x27;s certainly worth trying out one bottle to see if it works for you.</li>
            <li>In natural light, you could tell I had put a tanning spray over light skin.</li>
            <li>so worth it.</li>
            <li>It looks natural I get so many</li>
            <li>Color shows up pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I spray right after applying the mousse.</li>
            <li>I wanted something that would show up right away, and this did just that.</li>
            <li>the application is super easy with no mess.</li>
            <li>Not like anyone&#x27;s really in the mood to clean their bathroom after tanning themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Looks very realistic!</li>
            <li>came super fast</li>
            <li>The color is natural and the application is easy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought quite a few self INSTANT tanners and this one is the best.</li>
            <li>The seller sent it super fast.</li>
            <li>The bottle goes a long way...lasts many full body uses.</li>
            <li>Yikes, it was hard to breath, I had this stuff up in my nose lol.</li>
            <li>This was  hard to find in the store, so I was happy to get the bottle for 10 bucks incldg.</li>
            <li>But pretty color</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the closest one, so far, to looking genuine and not orange or blotchy.</li>
            <li>The second time I stood on a towel, that was better.</li>
            <li>I was without any tan when I applied, so I&#x27;m sure applying daily would create a deeper color.</li>
            <li>As far as smell, it was light, but I still smelled like a sunless tanner.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay, but personally wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li>Was told by a client to try product, and three years later, still love it.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use it outdoors if possible.</li>
            <li>Not fake looking or orangy at all.</li>
            <li>I primarily use it to maintain a tan face and chest since I wash my face so frequently and cover it while tanning.</li>
            <li>First off, this product did NOT spray on evenly.</li>
            <li>You can layer it on easily, which is great for correct farmer&#x27;s arms or weird tan lines.  </li>
            <li>Had I never tried other tanning products, I&#x27;d probably rate this a four or five because it does impart a nice glow to skin.</li>
            <li>The best part of this spray is that if I put it on a little too liberally, I can get a washcloth with soap and after a little scrubbing it comes right off.</li>
            <li>Looks natural, dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply -- only reason why it even gets one star.</li>
            <li>This mist goes on dark so that you can see where you are spraying and then dries a lovely golden tan color.</li>
            <li>This is the only one that doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy, and doesn&#x27;t have that strong DHA smell to it.  </li>
            <li>so you have to be quick with it and make sure you spread it on evenly before it dries, took me a little whole to get used to it</li>
            <li>Note: do this in the shower or bathtub with the curtains drawn or outside because it&#x27;s going to leave a fine mist that will stain anything and everything in sight.</li>
            <li>Very highly recommend.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t tan your whole bathroom</li>
            <li>Brown/pink undertones like a real tan.</li>
            <li>It was very streaky too.</li>
            <li>I sprayed too much in one area and it puddled up and splotched.</li>
            <li>I think if I need a tan, I think I&#x27;ll go out in the real sun, except for my face.</li>
            <li>The formula dries fast too.</li>
            <li>This product I havent had the chance to use much.</li>
            <li>What I have usewd doesnt seem to really add any color to my skin at all.</li>
            <li>with the gloves the spray was very even and not pitted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t see much difference.</li>
            <li>, let alone I used a whole can</li>
            <li>But this is too much work, to &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; feeling.</li>
            <li>I much prefer the mousse</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not sticky and the powder evens out the color very well.</li>
            <li>It went on fast, and it was even.</li>
            <li>Getting ready to order another bottle.  </li>
            <li>The bronzer really helps you to see where you&#x27;re spraying.  </li>
            <li>Tans skin fast....</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re really just making streaks on your skin that you have to blend out, and that drip.</li>
            <li>Also the spray comes out kind of harshly</li>
            <li>great tan but quite messy, dries fast and lasts a long time, just about 8days.</li>
            <li>The color has a red tint to it which to me looks more natural than other self tanners I&#x27;ve used (I am pretty light skinned.)</li>
            <li>Only, who has time to spray themselves and clean their bathroom day after day?</li>
            <li>also don&#x27;t think it holds as long, and have to reapply more frequently to even out my tan lines.</li>
            <li>I was surprised it washed out so easily, yet stayed on my skin for several days @</li>
            <li>Versa Spa sprays a much lighter and more even mist, where as this one is a big clumpier and left spots which I didn&#x27;t experience with Versa Spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, this is great if you give yourself a spray on your face/chest before bed, you will wake up looking a little less scary... and have a nice healthy looking glow.</li>
            <li>Supposedly if you keep using it daily, it&#x27;ll build a more lasting tan, like</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than their more expensive competitors, but the color comes off in chunks.</li>
            <li>When using this I pull my hair back and do a quick mist including my neck.  </li>
            <li>And, the color itself wasn&#x27;t particularly brown.</li>
            <li>It was a little darker, but once I showered, most of the tan was gone and it was still not a solid looking tan in natural light.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>so far other than the smell I love the color.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I wasn&#x27;t happy about being tanless.</li>
            <li>Love this product but IT IS MESSY.</li>
            <li>Overall finish is nice but not worth the cleanup after.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say if you&#x27;re considering a new tanner you should try this one.</li>
            <li>Natural looking, decent smelling, not streaky, and the color lasts.</li>
            <li>Very natural.</li>
            <li>This one is easy, fast, and has very little smell.</li>
            <li>Once I showered the next morning, everything I&#x27;d applied from Body Drench washed right off and completely.</li>
            <li>Its reasonably priced and does a very nice job getting my very pale tone a few shades darker.</li>
            <li>You actually can see what your getting, Not too much on knees or ankles!</li>
            <li>Moisturize frequently afterwards!</li>
            <li>So natural!</li>
            <li>This is the 2nd tanning spray I&#x27;ve used - the first was Versa Spa</li>
            <li>not heavy or thick very light</li>
            <li>I use a cream sunless tanner on my face, and it never dried out my skin like this spray mist.</li>
            <li>I feel like after one or two showers it is completely gone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like I was spraying it everywhere, I was being conscious of where and how I was using it.</li>
            <li>Also, the spray has an ingredient in it that is very toxic if inhaled (which is inevitable).</li>
            <li>No orange and the closest to natural</li>
            <li>In a dim room, I looked tan.</li>
            <li>I took off one star because I can&#x27;t use it consistently enough because I have to commit to cleaning the whole floor afterward.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, no do-it-yourself spray has ever been as good as the expensive spray booths at tanning salons.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to get a little spotty if you&#x27;re not careful</li>
            <li>My new favorite for a truly dark tan is St Moriz mousse in dark.</li>
            <li>This is also not a typical self tanner.</li>
            <li>I apply after using regular mousse self tanner from a high end brand.</li>
            <li>Too far and the product just fills the air and barely does anything to your skin.</li>
            <li>It was very pink when I first put it on.  </li>
            <li>It arrived in the time I expected and was reasonable in price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a VERY white girl and this made me look naturally tan.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Suggestions for use- the first time I used this, I used one spray down each limb.</li>
            <li>Smells kinda funny, like a typical self tanner.</li>
            <li>I love to spray this on when I feel a little pale and it leaves me looking sunkissed.</li>
            <li>You do turn a little pink for a little bit, but it turns a nice color after that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to blend this by dabbing with a dark towel or washrag if you spray it on too heavily or make a mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t dramatic enough to be noticeable, just a minor change I&#x27;d recommend; changing the sprayer to come out a bit more seamlessly.</li>
            <li>did this in the shower, and it really made a mess everywhere.</li>

            <li> However, for a &amp;#34;Medium/Dark&amp;#34; tanning product, I&#x27;d say it should be labeled as &amp;#34;Medium&amp;#34; at best.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m extremely fair skinned</li>
            <li> It was a good color</li>
            <li> A good product.</li>
            <li> This works 100%, if you have a good place to spray it..</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin</li>
            <li> Color turns out really good.</li>
            <li> It works great, no smudges, easy to apply!</li>
            <li> This is the best tanning spray ever, colors immediately, with no stickiness and dries quickly, and smells like vanilla.</li>
            <li> This is the best quick tan</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, just make sure you are in the shower</li>
            <li> and I heard so many great things from clients that I bought a bottle at work to try for myself.</li>
            <li> It is a fine mist and smells really good!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>

            <li> I love the scent!</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> The color is great not orangie goes on easy, just wear gloves to rub on skin or your palms will be funky orange.</li>
            <li> a comfy with amazing color</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> this product is really nice not orange at all</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s how nice the color is it  glows on its own))))NATURAL</li>
            <li> This tanner is meant to be a temporary, one day tan, which would work if you&#x27;re just spot treating your arms or legs to look nice with an outfit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also smells nice and moisturizes my face.  </li>
            <li> Nice, even, effortless, application.</li>
            <li> Also it smells really nice (vanilla/almondy).</li>
            <li> I had to spray three times to even tab bit of nice color, and still I felt that it was&lt;br</li>
            <li> Goes on nicely and evenly.</li>
            <li> I really liked this self-tan.</li>
            <li> IT WAS NICE BROWN</li>
            <li> Nice color but washes off if you shower to often</li>
            <li> It smelled nice and gave a really nice color.</li>
            <li> Great for a quick burst of color.</li>
            <li> My friend has a much paler complexion and it looks very good on him as well.</li>
            <li> I continue to use it because it by far gives the best results of any self-tanner I have tried.</li>
            <li> This is by far THE BEST self tanning spray ever!</li>
            <li> I have tried all types of sunless tanners from mousse to lotion, and this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> Goes on easily!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and gives an even glow!</li>
            <li> love this product I will be ordering more.  </li>
            <li> And it instantly gives you a flawless glow!</li>
            <li> I just ordered three more cans.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure with practice I will get better.</li>
            <li> I thought the color was ok.</li>
            <li> This time it came in a bag and both cans had the top and the nozzle off</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not a terrible product, just not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I mostly just use it on my legs.</li>
            <li> It is more of a red-ish tint.  </li>
            <li> and I sprayed this on top.  </li>
            <li> I have not found a better product YET.</li>
            <li> I work with many ladies who also now use it, and swear by it.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Love product, will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It was more of a brown.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and then having to wash them, then maybe it would be better.</li>
            <li> I have used much better self tanners.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you exfoliate before using it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> but once I did, I love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did not color me orange, and has a much better fragrance than most tanning products.</li>
            <li> This is the best I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different brands.</li>
            <li> worked nice and smooth on my face but</li>
            <li> I love the color I get from this product.  </li>
            <li> The tan that I got out of this was, for lack of a better word, translucent.</li>
            <li> I love the way it looks and smells.  </li>
            <li> I use it after exfoliating in the shower on my face, neck, and shoulders mostly.  </li>
            <li> then most spray tan bottles out there.</li>
            <li> I love it and will keep ordering.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great but very blotchy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> its a nice golden, warm and rich looking tan.</li>
            <li> Easy to use not a fan of the smell but not terrible</li>
            <li> Great color and looks natural!</li>
            <li> Perfect and pretty natural.</li>
            <li> It is a nice golden brown.</li>
            <li> Sprays on easily.</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;CT.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you are holding it almost a full arms length from your body.</li>
            <li> It is hands down the best spray tanner out there, and I have tried them ALL.  </li>
            <li> But in a pinch for a quick tan, this will do OK.</li>
            <li> Because you will get pregnant and die!</li>
            <li> just wash your hands quick after applying!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few products and I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li> Others said, &amp;#34;spray lightly</li>
            <li> It creates a very natural looking tan, has a nice fine mist, sprays in every direction, and smells like what I call &amp;#34;tropical chocolate&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> So worth it!</li>
            <li> It puts out a super fine mist</li>
            <li> Second best thus far is this spray.</li>
            <li> But be advised, you&#x27;ll have to clean your shower immediately afterward.</li>
            <li> Read all the reviews, was super excited about this product.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a nice, even, sun kissed glow, do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this for over 4 years, I love this tanning product so much.</li>
            <li> This is a good value and I am a big fan.</li>
            <li> ok I ordered this quick tan for two reasons 1st the price was very good,, 2nd of all it didn&#x27;t ship from china((((didn&#x27;t want to wait that long .it came on time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as great as what other reviewers said.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been to hell and back with tanning sprays for many many years.</li>
            <li> I would use this again for a quick spot treat, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> Just a quick spray does the job.</li>
            <li> The spray dries quickly so that you don&#x27;t feel greasy all day.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended :-)</li>
            <li> My shower was clean to start with, so this just rinsed right off the walls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many tanners and I always come back to this one because It&#x27;s so natural looking and smells good.</li>
            <li> REALLY!!</li>
            <li> THIS S THE FIRST TANNING SPRAY THAT DIDN&#x27;T LEAVE MY SKIN ORANGE !  </li>
            <li> Gave just the right color, dries quickly.</li>
            <li> For $10 it&#x27;s certainly worth trying out one bottle to see if it works for you.</li>
            <li> In natural light, you could tell I had put a tanning spray over light skin.</li>
            <li> so worth it.</li>
            <li> It looks natural I get so many</li>
            <li> Color shows up pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I spray right after applying the mousse.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that would show up right away, and this did just that.</li>
            <li> the application is super easy with no mess.</li>
            <li> Not like anyone&#x27;s really in the mood to clean their bathroom after tanning themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Looks very realistic!</li>
            <li> came super fast</li>
            <li> The color is natural and the application is easy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought quite a few self INSTANT tanners and this one is the best.</li>
            <li> The seller sent it super fast.</li>
            <li> The bottle goes a long way...lasts many full body uses.</li>
            <li> Yikes, it was hard to breath, I had this stuff up in my nose lol.</li>
            <li> This was  hard to find in the store, so I was happy to get the bottle for 10 bucks incldg.</li>
            <li> But pretty color</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the closest one, so far, to looking genuine and not orange or blotchy.</li>
            <li> The second time I stood on a towel, that was better.</li>
            <li> I was without any tan when I applied, so I&#x27;m sure applying daily would create a deeper color.</li>
            <li> As far as smell, it was light, but I still smelled like a sunless tanner.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay, but personally wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Was told by a client to try product, and three years later, still love it.</li>
            <li> Be sure to use it outdoors if possible.</li>
            <li> Not fake looking or orangy at all.</li>
            <li> I primarily use it to maintain a tan face and chest since I wash my face so frequently and cover it while tanning.</li>
            <li> First off, this product did NOT spray on evenly.</li>
            <li> You can layer it on easily, which is great for correct farmer&#x27;s arms or weird tan lines.  </li>
            <li> Had I never tried other tanning products, I&#x27;d probably rate this a four or five because it does impart a nice glow to skin.</li>
            <li> The best part of this spray is that if I put it on a little too liberally, I can get a washcloth with soap and after a little scrubbing it comes right off.</li>
            <li> Looks natural, dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply -- only reason why it even gets one star.</li>
            <li> This mist goes on dark so that you can see where you are spraying and then dries a lovely golden tan color.</li>
            <li> This is the only one that doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy, and doesn&#x27;t have that strong DHA smell to it.  </li>
            <li> so you have to be quick with it and make sure you spread it on evenly before it dries, took me a little whole to get used to it</li>
            <li> Note: do this in the shower or bathtub with the curtains drawn or outside because it&#x27;s going to leave a fine mist that will stain anything and everything in sight.</li>
            <li> Very highly recommend.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t tan your whole bathroom</li>
            <li> Brown/pink undertones like a real tan.</li>
            <li> It was very streaky too.</li>
            <li> I sprayed too much in one area and it puddled up and splotched.</li>
            <li> I think if I need a tan, I think I&#x27;ll go out in the real sun, except for my face.</li>
            <li> The formula dries fast too.</li>
            <li> This product I havent had the chance to use much.</li>
            <li> What I have usewd doesnt seem to really add any color to my skin at all.</li>
            <li> with the gloves the spray was very even and not pitted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t see much difference.</li>
            <li> , let alone I used a whole can</li>
            <li> But this is too much work, to &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; feeling.</li>
            <li> I much prefer the mousse</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not sticky and the powder evens out the color very well.</li>
            <li> It went on fast, and it was even.</li>
            <li> Getting ready to order another bottle.  </li>
            <li> The bronzer really helps you to see where you&#x27;re spraying.  </li>
            <li> Tans skin fast....</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re really just making streaks on your skin that you have to blend out, and that drip.</li>
            <li> Also the spray comes out kind of harshly</li>
            <li> great tan but quite messy, dries fast and lasts a long time, just about 8days.</li>
            <li> The color has a red tint to it which to me looks more natural than other self tanners I&#x27;ve used (I am pretty light skinned.)</li>
            <li> Only, who has time to spray themselves and clean their bathroom day after day?</li>
            <li> also don&#x27;t think it holds as long, and have to reapply more frequently to even out my tan lines.</li>
            <li> I was surprised it washed out so easily, yet stayed on my skin for several days @</li>
            <li> Versa Spa sprays a much lighter and more even mist, where as this one is a big clumpier and left spots which I didn&#x27;t experience with Versa Spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, this is great if you give yourself a spray on your face/chest before bed, you will wake up looking a little less scary... and have a nice healthy looking glow.</li>
            <li> Supposedly if you keep using it daily, it&#x27;ll build a more lasting tan, like</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than their more expensive competitors, but the color comes off in chunks.</li>
            <li> When using this I pull my hair back and do a quick mist including my neck.  </li>
            <li> And, the color itself wasn&#x27;t particularly brown.</li>
            <li> It was a little darker, but once I showered, most of the tan was gone and it was still not a solid looking tan in natural light.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> so far other than the smell I love the color.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I wasn&#x27;t happy about being tanless.</li>
            <li> Love this product but IT IS MESSY.</li>
            <li> Overall finish is nice but not worth the cleanup after.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say if you&#x27;re considering a new tanner you should try this one.</li>
            <li> Natural looking, decent smelling, not streaky, and the color lasts.</li>
            <li> Very natural.</li>
            <li> This one is easy, fast, and has very little smell.</li>
            <li> Once I showered the next morning, everything I&#x27;d applied from Body Drench washed right off and completely.</li>
            <li> Its reasonably priced and does a very nice job getting my very pale tone a few shades darker.</li>
            <li> You actually can see what your getting, Not too much on knees or ankles!</li>
            <li> Moisturize frequently afterwards!</li>
            <li> So natural!</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd tanning spray I&#x27;ve used - the first was Versa Spa</li>
            <li> not heavy or thick very light</li>
            <li> I use a cream sunless tanner on my face, and it never dried out my skin like this spray mist.</li>
            <li> I feel like after one or two showers it is completely gone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like I was spraying it everywhere, I was being conscious of where and how I was using it.</li>
            <li> Also, the spray has an ingredient in it that is very toxic if inhaled (which is inevitable).</li>
            <li> No orange and the closest to natural</li>
            <li> In a dim room, I looked tan.</li>
            <li> I took off one star because I can&#x27;t use it consistently enough because I have to commit to cleaning the whole floor afterward.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, no do-it-yourself spray has ever been as good as the expensive spray booths at tanning salons.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to get a little spotty if you&#x27;re not careful</li>
            <li> My new favorite for a truly dark tan is St Moriz mousse in dark.</li>
            <li> This is also not a typical self tanner.</li>
            <li> I apply after using regular mousse self tanner from a high end brand.</li>
            <li> Too far and the product just fills the air and barely does anything to your skin.</li>
            <li> It was very pink when I first put it on.  </li>
            <li> It arrived in the time I expected and was reasonable in price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a VERY white girl and this made me look naturally tan.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Suggestions for use- the first time I used this, I used one spray down each limb.</li>
            <li> Smells kinda funny, like a typical self tanner.</li>
            <li> I love to spray this on when I feel a little pale and it leaves me looking sunkissed.</li>
            <li> You do turn a little pink for a little bit, but it turns a nice color after that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to blend this by dabbing with a dark towel or washrag if you spray it on too heavily or make a mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t dramatic enough to be noticeable, just a minor change I&#x27;d recommend; changing the sprayer to come out a bit more seamlessly.</li>
            <li> did this in the shower, and it really made a mess everywhere.</li>
            <li> I am a very pale skin blonde and the comments from friends have been nothing but positive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After several attempts to get the color even, and giving it ages to dry, I noticed anything white</li>
            <li> I exfoliate, use a mit, and can usually achieve a very even tan with any product.</li>
            <li> It stayed on my skin just long enough to still have some color</li>
            <li> Works well and fast, but very messy.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last for very long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a seasoned tan in a can user and have tried most of the products on the market and this one is by far the worst one I have ever used.</li>
            <li> If I could get a nice color easily, without having to feel disgusting in my bed sheets and clothes for a few nights in&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never like the smell of the sunless tan, which smells on skin as long as the &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; is there.</li>
            <li> it keeps my tan all year long.</li>
            <li> However the product did not spray evenly; I was left with big droplets that dripped and ran down my leg rather than an even spray.</li>
            <li> I use this product mostly in the winter when I am tired of looking pale!  </li>
            <li> I rated it 1* below Australian Gold JWOWW only because the JWOWW gets you a little darker and lasts longer.</li>
            <li> and I often have a hard time getting self tanners to work on me and not look orange or just not dark enough.</li>
            <li> Overall this product is not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> I laid towels down to stand on in my bathroom and this spray covered the entire floor beyond the towels, covered the toilet, half the sink and part of the walls.</li>
            <li> Also it was such a mess that I had to basically wipe everything off with a wet towel as soon as I was done.</li>
            <li> This caused trouble for me a few times because I work in the medical field and have had some alcohol drip on my arm during the day and have noticed later on an obvious &amp;#34;drip line&amp;#34; running down my arm.</li>
            <li> but I expected it to last a little longer.  </li>
            <li> I do apply moisturizer on my knees , elbows and other dry areas .&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mix with lotion and use everyday for lasting gradual tan.</li>
            <li> If using it on your porch or backyard isn&#x27;t an option, use it in the shower with the curtain closed.</li>
            <li> so I expected that.</li>
            <li> I use it if I&#x27;am pale and want to an instant tan before I go out.</li>
            <li> I noticed this product was extremely drying to my skin, for days.</li>
            <li> After looking at other people&#x27;s feedback, I spray in the backyard, so as to not get any unwanted spray on the walls/floor.</li>
            <li> This product also doesn&#x27;t have the metallic give-away smell of other sunless tanners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> using other sprays by well known brands for years, I will now be using this.</li>
            <li> I like the cap sprayer as it has never clogged, stopped working or fallen off like other brands.</li>
            <li> I, on the other hand, will not purchase it again.  </li>
            <li> This is both a sunless tanner and a dark bronzer.</li>
            <li> I forgot to cover the bottom of my feet, and I had to sand them afterwards to get the dark tan off the bottom of my feet.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t dark at all.</li>
            <li> I recommend spraying in the shower then getting out and spraying the shower down with water immediately.</li>
            <li> It sprays even upside down.</li>
            <li> For half the price</li>
            <li> The results of this product were darker than Fake Bake, but I&#x27;d still use Fake Bake over this because it is easier, dries faster, and is much more even.</li>
            <li> Even holding it two feet or so from my skin, the spray would hiss and speckle my skin in little dots of dark orange.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last as long as I wanted, but it is just fake tan</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a self tanner, I&#x27;d recommend sticking to something less messy, like a lotion.</li>
            <li> My husband thought I looked a little orange after the brown bronzer was rinsed.</li>
            <li> Luckily, they weren&#x27;t broken but I was not happy with the packaging at all!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s messy as hell so use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> If you want to destroy your bathroom, towels, clothes, and anything else you come into contact with during the 12+ hours after your tan, again this is your product!&lt;br</li>
            <li> For about 12+ hours after you tan (during the time you cannot shower) it will stay on your skin and destroy anything it touches.</li>
            <li> It takes a few hours for the color to fully surface.  </li>
            <li> Gives dark color that looks pretty natural but wears off horribly.</li>
            <li> It is a bit messy, so you need to be careful!&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my go-to tanner, and I always keep a few bottles in my closet.  </li>
            <li> Super disappointed.</li>
            <li> For people with very pale skin, this product would probably work well as it doesn&#x27;t make your skin dark, and therefore you wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about streaks.</li>
            <li> It would work to use if you&#x27;re very pale and want to go out in a bathing suit, perhaps to darken your tan, but don&#x27;t want to go out looking pale.</li>
            <li> The bad thing about this is that you&#x27;ll go through a bottle in a week or two max, depending how much you use.</li>
            <li> and, when I order it from Amazon it usually comes in a box.</li>
            <li> From what I&#x27;d seen about this product, I thought it&#x27;d at least stay on for a few days after applying it.</li>
            <li> I even moisturized twice a day if not more.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t scrub my body because I am too lazy to do that ...</li>
            <li> It keeps you looking bronze (not orange) for up to a week with minimal fading, but the bad thing is (And i&#x27;ve noticed this with every tan i&#x27;ve used and it could just be because I&#x27;m not exfoliating enough?)</li>
            <li> I am normally very pale and do not tan well at all this product</li>
            <li> The spray is a little tough to get a hang of.</li>
            <li> The spray is hard to cover evenly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard floor</li>
            <li> I have used a WIDE variety of self-tanners and when I used this, it changed the game!</li>
            <li> The can was dented and the spray button was missing!!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll want to wear rubber gloves (such as food service ones) because it will stain your hands so bad that you&#x27;ll need a brillo pad to get the brown off.</li>
            <li> It dries fast and doesn&#x27;t leave a horrible tanning smell.</li>
            <li> so I would know if it was too dark rather than waiting for hours and then realizing it was a god awful mess.</li>
            <li> can never go wrong.</li>
            <li> Gives immediate color with bronzer that will wash off easily, No smell folks!!!!!  </li>
            <li> The upside was that it didn&#x27;t stain anything and wasn&#x27;t difficult to wash off afterward.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need gloves; it&#x27;ll be difficult to wash your hands without creating streaks everywhere.</li>
            <li> but it seemed expensive</li>
            <li> Looks like scales when it comes off, and is hard to remove when you decide you are sick of the scales</li>
            <li> Very fake looking.</li>
            <li> If you are going for the awful, orange, splotchy, horrible tan that you see in body builder competitions, this is your product!</li>
            <li> The color is miserable...</li>
            <li> The product was in horrific condition when I got it!!</li>
            <li> Otherwise, the color is horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last for very long. But pretty color</li>
            <li> Best tanning spray. I&#x27;ve been to hell and back with tanning sprays for many many years. This one is easy, fast, and has very little smell. I recommend spraying in the shower then getting out and spraying the shower down with water immediately. This way there is no stain left anywhere except on your body.</li>
            <li> Love this bronzer/self tanner! You actually can see what your getting, Not too much on knees or ankles! Goes on easily!</li>
            <li> great tan but quite messy, dries fast and lasts a long time, just about 8days. but got allover my feet and they were disgistingly orangy tan FOREVER lol.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Gave just the right color, dries quickly.</li>
            <li> can never go wrong. came super fast</li>
            <li> love this product I will be ordering more.  Works instantly</li>
            <li> The best self tanning spray I&#x27;ve tried. In my opinion, no do-it-yourself spray has ever been as good as the expensive spray booths at tanning salons. Second best thus far is this spray. It&#x27;s the closest one, so far, to looking genuine and not orange or blotchy. For $10 it&#x27;s certainly worth trying out one bottle to see if it works for you. I have an olive complexion, and i like it. My friend has a much paler complexion and it looks very good on him as well.</li>
            <li> Best spray tan in a can out there!!!! I am a very pale skin blonde and the comments from friends have been nothing but positive. The color is great not orangie goes on easy, just wear gloves to rub on skin or your palms will be funky orange.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, just make sure you are in the shower so you don&#x27;t tan your whole bathroom</li>
            <li> I have used a WIDE variety of self-tanners and when I used this, it changed the game! This product is THE BEST self-tanner out there! It&#x27;s easy to use and gives an even glow! Another problem I ha with others was the smell! This product has the best smell ever! And it instantly gives you a flawless glow! I&#x27;m in love! 💖</li>
            <li> Best tan I&#x27;ve used in a while. I&#x27;ve tried a few products and I wasn&#x27;t impressed. I came to this by recommendation by a friend. It&#x27;s messy as hell so use it in the shower. I used it with a tanning mit so I could evenly apply. The bad thing about this is that you&#x27;ll go through a bottle in a week or two max, depending how much you use. It keeps you looking bronze (not orange) for up to a week with minimal fading, but the bad thing is (And i&#x27;ve noticed this with every tan i&#x27;ve used and it could just be because I&#x27;m not exfoliating enough?) is once it begins to fade, good luck getting that wonderful all over color again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At sallys this thing is like $23 for a bottle so this is a great deal. I&#x27;d say if you&#x27;re considering a new tanner you should try this one. It dries fast and doesn&#x27;t leave a horrible tanning smell.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Its reasonably priced and does a very nice job getting my very pale tone a few shades darker.</li>
            <li> I apply after using regular mousse self tanner from a high end brand. I spray right after applying the mousse. I also wash my hands after using the mousse and then use this to spray the tops of my hands that way I dont need to worry about using gloves and trying not to get my knuckles, streaks, etc. Also, this is great if you give yourself a spray on your face/chest before bed, you will wake up looking a little less scary... and have a nice healthy looking glow. It is comparable to more expensive sprays but comes off not so evenly if you dont scrub it off as soon as it starts flaking. The lasting power is 3-4 days. The color is perfect... not orange based. Brown/pink undertones like a real tan. Great price and product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely fair skinned and I often have a hard time getting self tanners to work on me and not look orange or just not dark enough. This definitely had the color that I wanted; it was brown and had an immediate effect on on my skin. I like how I could see the color as it is being applied so I would know if it was too dark rather than waiting for hours and then realizing it was a god awful mess. However the product did not spray evenly; I was left with big droplets that dripped and ran down my leg rather than an even spray. Also it was such a mess that I had to basically wipe everything off with a wet towel as soon as I was done. It stayed on my skin just long enough to still have some color so it actually ended up working out but I had a moment of panic there. Note: do this in the shower or bathtub with the curtains drawn or outside because it&#x27;s going to leave a fine mist that will stain anything and everything in sight. I had to throw away my bath mats and a towel.</li>
            <li> This is the best tanning spray ever, colors immediately, with no stickiness and dries quickly, and smells like vanilla. I just ordered three more cans. Love this product.  Sherry</li>
            <li> It was very pink when I first put it on.  It was very streaky too. I will stick with St Moritz.</li>
            <li> This is both a sunless tanner and a dark bronzer. I applied in my shower stall. Yikes, it was hard to breath, I had this stuff up in my nose lol. My shower was clean to start with, so this just rinsed right off the walls. I forgot to cover the bottom of my feet, and I had to sand them afterwards to get the dark tan off the bottom of my feet. Oops! The second time I stood on a towel, that was better. I had difficulty spraying well enough to get an even color. I sprayed too much in one area and it puddled up and splotched. Then I had missed areas on my arms and legs. I&#x27;m sure with practice I will get better. I was without any tan when I applied, so I&#x27;m sure applying daily would create a deeper color. I noticed this product was extremely drying to my skin, for days. I use a cream sunless tanner on my face, and it never dried out my skin like this spray mist. Moisturize frequently afterwards! As far as smell, it was light, but I still smelled like a sunless tanner. My husband thought I looked a little orange after the brown bronzer was rinsed. I thought the color was ok. I think if I need a tan, I think I&#x27;ll go out in the real sun, except for my face. I never like the smell of the sunless tan, which smells on skin as long as the &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; is there. But in a pinch for a quick tan, this will do OK.</li>
            <li> The product itself is terrific, have used it for years and, when I order it from Amazon it usually comes in a box. This time it came in a bag and both cans had the top and the nozzle off and I had to reattach them myself.  Luckily, they weren&#x27;t broken but I was not happy with the packaging at all!</li>
            <li> Awesome!  I always have this in stock - it keeps my tan all year long.</li>
            <li> It was a good color but I expected it to last a little longer.  I feel like after one or two showers it is completely gone.</li>
            <li> One of, if not the best tanner I&#x27;ve used in 20 years. Sprays on easily. Perfect coloring. Doesn&#x27;t look orange. Fades away perfectly. Highly recommended :-)</li>
            <li> First time self-tanning and it worked great! You do turn a little pink for a little bit, but it turns a nice color after that.</li>
            <li> If you are going for the awful, orange, splotchy, horrible tan that you see in body builder competitions, this is your product! If you are looking for a nice, even, sun kissed glow, do not waste your money. If you want to destroy your bathroom, towels, clothes, and anything else you come into contact with during the 12+ hours after your tan, again this is your product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a seasoned tan in a can user and have tried most of the products on the market and this one is by far the worst one I have ever used. It is the messiest product out there... Doesn&#x27;t matter if you spray in your shower or tanning tent and then stand in front of a fan while it dries. For about 12+ hours after you tan (during the time you cannot shower) it will stay on your skin and destroy anything it touches. The color is miserable... I actually felt like someone out of a meme the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously... Just don&#x27;t do it. Because you will get pregnant and die!</li>
            <li> Great color! The color is natural and the application is easy. After looking at other people&#x27;s feedback, I spray in the backyard, so as to not get any unwanted spray on the walls/floor. This product also doesn&#x27;t have the metallic give-away smell of other sunless tanners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using other sprays by well known brands for years, I will now be using this.</li>
            <li> Absolutely awesome!!!!  Love it.  Gives immediate color with bronzer that will wash off easily, No smell folks!!!!!  It;s great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this for over 4 years, I love this tanning product so much. Does not make you look orange, everyone always asks me where I go tanning.</li>
            <li> Thank you for a tan in March!</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!! So natural!</li>
            <li> This is a great tanning spray! Just make sure you are holding it almost a full arms length from your body. I stand in the shower, then rinse the shower after. Don&#x27;t do this in the room, it will be all over te floor and walls.</li>
            <li> ok I ordered this quick tan for two reasons 1st the price was very good,, 2nd of all it didn&#x27;t ship from china((((didn&#x27;t want to wait that long .it came on time. this product is really nice not orange at all REALLY!! its a nice golden, warm and rich looking tan. the application is super easy with no mess. I personally like to spray and rub in. no lines or spots. not heavy or thick very light a comfy with amazing color .to add there is no glitter or shimmer.(((its not needed that&#x27;s how nice the color is it  glows on its own))))NATURAL...  I would tell anyone and everyone to give this a try .ITS TRULY A FIVE STAR PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> You HAVE to spray it in the tub or it gets every where. You&#x27;ll want to wear rubber gloves (such as food service ones) because it will stain your hands so bad that you&#x27;ll need a brillo pad to get the brown off. NO exaggeration. I also work out and as I sweat the color comes off all over my cloths. I guess for a day it&#x27;s okay, but personally wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great for a quick burst of color. I have very Irish skin and this works great. After I spray it on, I just rub it in and I have instant color that darkens over the remainder of the day!</li>
            <li> I use this product mostly in the winter when I am tired of looking pale!  It works great, no smudges, easy to apply!</li>
            <li> A good product. I rated it 1* below Australian Gold JWOWW only because the JWOWW gets you a little darker and lasts longer. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Works just like the one I buy from Sally&#x27;s ! For half the price</li>
            <li> From what I&#x27;d seen about this product, I thought it&#x27;d at least stay on for a few days after applying it. Nope, not at all. I used this product to help blend another bottle tanner I&#x27;ve been using, since there&#x27;s areas that don&#x27;t apply evenly, etc... Once I showered the next morning, everything I&#x27;d applied from Body Drench washed right off and completely. This tanner is meant to be a temporary, one day tan, which would work if you&#x27;re just spot treating your arms or legs to look nice with an outfit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing is, it gets EVERYWHERE. I laid towels down to stand on in my bathroom and this spray covered the entire floor beyond the towels, covered the toilet, half the sink and part of the walls. It&#x27;s not like I was spraying it everywhere, I was being conscious of where and how I was using it. The upside was that it didn&#x27;t stain anything and wasn&#x27;t difficult to wash off afterward. Not like anyone&#x27;s really in the mood to clean their bathroom after tanning themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a terrible product, just not what I was looking for. Supposedly if you keep using it daily, it&#x27;ll build a more lasting tan, like Jergen&#x27;s lotion is supposed to do. Only, who has time to spray themselves and clean their bathroom day after day? I would use this again for a quick spot treat, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for over 20 years and I have never been this tan. This product is absolutely amazing. I mostly just use it on my legs. It is not orange at all. It is a nice golden brown. It does not streak at all. It is a fine mist and smells really good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought quite a few self INSTANT tanners and this one is the best. It goes on evenly and does not streak. The formula dries fast too. I like the cap sprayer as it has never clogged, stopped working or fallen off like other brands. This is a good value and I am a big fan. I will be sticking to the brand from now on.</li>
            <li> I ended up giving my cans to a friend who likes this tanner.  I, on the other hand, will not purchase it again.  The spray is hard to cover evenly and I would have to blot and spread with a towel.  The color is not orange.  It is more of a red-ish tint.  I did like the color somewhat, but I have switched back to Jergens tanning lotion, which works well.  Also, the spray has an ingredient in it that is very toxic if inhaled (which is inevitable).</li>
            <li> Awesome Awesome Awesome!  I already have a deep tan and I sprayed this on top.  It came out even and I looked like I just came back from the Caribbean!</li>
            <li> The product was in horrific condition when I got it!! The can was dented and the spray button was missing!! I was so displeased! Better shipping and care guys!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many tanners and I always come back to this one because It&#x27;s so natural looking and smells good. So worth it!</li>
            <li> This is really great stuff! I got it because it&#x27;s a spray so I could get my back. It sprays even upside down. Awesome! I use it on my hands and feet. Just a quick spray does the job. Looks great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than their more expensive competitors, but the color comes off in chunks. It doesn&#x27;t fade like an actual tan. I even moisturized twice a day if not more.</li>
            <li> This spray tan is GREAT. I started using it 3 years ago. I use to use tanning booths for over 10 years, BUT got skin cancer from the tanning booths. Needless to say, I wasn&#x27;t happy about being tanless. Was told by a client to try product, and three years later, still love it. I have not found a better product YET. I work with many ladies who also now use it, and swear by it. Looks natural, dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li> I tried this product at my friends and loved it!  When I use it, I often receive complements.  It also smells nice and moisturizes my face.  When using this I pull my hair back and do a quick mist including my neck.  I immediately use a make-up sponge to evenly distribute it on my face.  It takes a few hours for the color to fully surface.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Nice, even, effortless, application. Love product, will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I mix with lotion and use everyday for lasting gradual tan.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Smells delicious and made my skin look amazing! I recommend this if you ever think of self tanning.</li>
            <li> This product I havent had the chance to use much. What I have usewd doesnt seem to really add any color to my skin at all. It arrived in the time I expected and was reasonable in price</li>
            <li> Works well and fast, but very messy. Be sure to use it outdoors if possible. Being an aerosol, it gets everywhere. Walls, floor, carpet. If using it on your porch or backyard isn&#x27;t an option, use it in the shower with the curtain closed. But be advised, you&#x27;ll have to clean your shower immediately afterward. I continue to use it because it by far gives the best results of any self-tanner I have tried. No yellow, no orange, almost instant results. I do have to add, do not use rubbing alcohol on your skin or it will take the tan off almost immediately. This caused trouble for me a few times because I work in the medical field and have had some alcohol drip on my arm during the day and have noticed later on an obvious &amp;#34;drip line&amp;#34; running down my arm.</li>
            <li> Great tanning spray all around! My favorite! It puts out a super fine mist so I don&#x27;t even need to rub it in to make it go on even. Also it smells really nice (vanilla/almondy). Color shows up pretty quickly. Not fake looking or orangy at all. Very natural.</li>
            <li> Love this product but IT IS MESSY. Overspray gets on everything so spray outside if possible. If you spray in shower rinse overspray immediately so it doesn&#x27;t stain shower/tub</li>
            <li> Smells kinda funny, like a typical self tanner. so far other than the smell I love the color. Perfect and pretty natural. I am normally very pale and do not tan well at all this product is an inexpensive option for not blending into the snow during the winter.</li>
            <li> There were three great pro&#x27;s:  1) I didn&#x27;t find that my skin was orange. It was more of a brown.&lt;br /&gt;  2) It didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;drizzle&amp;#34; or have droplets at any time (even towards the end of the bottle/use.)&lt;br /&gt;  3) I used exfoliating gloves (per others recommendations, using just a loofa sponge didn&#x27;t work) and&lt;br /&gt;  with the gloves the spray was very even and not pitted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:  1) Others said, &amp;#34;spray lightly and that&#x27;s all you need&amp;#34; - BS  I had just a hint of color.&lt;br /&gt;  2) I really didn&#x27;t see much difference. I had to spray three times to even tab bit of nice color, and still I felt that it was&lt;br /&gt;  enough, let alone I used a whole can almost.&lt;br /&gt;  3) If I could get a nice color easily, without having to feel disgusting in my bed sheets and clothes for a few nights in&lt;br /&gt;  a row and then having to wash them, then maybe it would be better. But this is too much work, to &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; feeling.</li>
            <li> Does not go on evenly...I have used much better self tanners.</li>
            <li> Goes on nicely and evenly. Gives dark color that looks pretty natural but wears off horribly. Looks like scales when it comes off, and is hard to remove when you decide you are sick of the scales</li>
            <li> Great self tanner! No streaks, great color! Would highly recommend this product. Just make sure you exfoliate before using it.</li>
            <li> I much prefer the mousse but they don&#x27;t make it anymore.  It leaves a residue on the bathtub, counters, walls. Overall finish is nice but not worth the cleanup after. The seller sent it super fast.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It does not smell at all, Atleast not that I notice and I have used every self tanner out there. This is also not a typical self tanner. I use it if I&#x27;am pale and want to an instant tan before I go out. It sprays on so you have to be quick with it and make sure you spread it on evenly before it dries, took me a little whole to get used to it but once I did, I love it. The color has a red tint to it which to me looks more natural than other self tanners I&#x27;ve used (I am pretty light skinned.) I apply makeup powder after I apply the spray and it&#x27;s not sticky and the powder evens out the color very well.</li>
            <li> Great product! This mist goes on dark so that you can see where you are spraying and then dries a lovely golden tan color. The spray dries quickly so that you don&#x27;t feel greasy all day. The results are almost immediate and darken over the course of the day. I love to spray this on when I feel a little pale and it leaves me looking sunkissed. The best part of this spray is that if I put it on a little too liberally, I can get a washcloth with soap and after a little scrubbing it comes right off.</li>
            <li> I really liked this self-tan. It went on fast, and it was even. I wanted something that would show up right away, and this did just that. It doesn&#x27;t last as long as I wanted, but it is just fake tan so I expected that.</li>
            <li> This works 100%, if you have a good place to spray it..like in someone else&#x27;s bathroom. It is a bit messy, so you need to be careful!&lt;br /&gt;It did not color me orange, and has a much better fragrance than most tanning products. I did not have problems with it staining my clothes either. I was surprised it washed out so easily, yet stayed on my skin for several days @ a time.&lt;br /&gt; It lasted for several sprays and &amp;#34;upkeep&amp;#34; over my cruise, and probably kept me from getting skin cancer. I still have 1/2 a bottle. This was  hard to find in the store, so I was happy to get the bottle for 10 bucks incldg. the shipping charges thru Amazon. I will look forward to using this product in the future.</li>
            <li> Great smelling and looking product when you apply it.  Goes on well just wash your hands quick after applying!  Also don&#x27;t rub yourself anything for awhile or may stain stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!  Getting ready to order another bottle.  The bronzer really helps you to see where you&#x27;re spraying.  This is the best I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different brands.</li>
            <li> Tans skin fast....worked nice and smooth on my face but everywhere else it made my skin look spotted like I had a skin disorder.</li>
            <li> the only self tanner i will use! always get compliments and have turned many people onto this product!</li>
            <li> This is by far THE BEST self tanning spray ever! We sold it at my workplace and I heard so many great things from clients that I bought a bottle at work to try for myself. I&#x27;m a VERY white girl and this made me look naturally tan. The bottle goes a long way...lasts many full body uses. I primarily use it to maintain a tan face and chest since I wash my face so frequently and cover it while tanning. I highly recommend it. I love the scent!</li>
            <li> Good product. You need a roller in order not to look orange or have strikes.</li>
            <li> I love the color I get from this product.  No orange and the closest to natural that I&#x27;ve  ever gotten from a self tanner.  Will buy again and would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> Had I never tried other tanning products, I&#x27;d probably rate this a four or five because it does impart a nice glow to skin. However, for a &amp;#34;Medium/Dark&amp;#34; tanning product, I&#x27;d say it should be labeled as &amp;#34;Medium&amp;#34; at best. For people with very pale skin, this product would probably work well as it doesn&#x27;t make your skin dark, and therefore you wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about streaks. The spray is a little tough to get a hang of. Too close and you&#x27;re really just making streaks on your skin that you have to blend out, and that drip. Too far and the product just fills the air and barely does anything to your skin. I resorted to using it close and then blending with a mit. The tan that I got out of this was, for lack of a better word, translucent. In a dim room, I looked tan. In natural light, you could tell I had put a tanning spray over light skin. I&#x27;m an experienced tanner and sunless tanner. I exfoliate, use a mit, and can usually achieve a very even tan with any product. The results of this product were darker than Fake Bake, but I&#x27;d still use Fake Bake over this because it is easier, dries faster, and is much more even. My new favorite for a truly dark tan is St Moriz mousse in dark. Nothing beats it.&lt;br /&gt;Suggestions for use- the first time I used this, I used one spray down each limb. It wasn&#x27;t dark at all. The second time, I sprayed up close and covered my limbs. It was a little darker, but once I showered, most of the tan was gone and it was still not a solid looking tan in natural light. If you&#x27;re using this, use a lot!&lt;br /&gt;Overall- I won&#x27;t throw this out. Maybe I&#x27;ll use it as a backup. It would work to use if you&#x27;re very pale and want to go out in a bathing suit, perhaps to darken your tan, but don&#x27;t want to go out looking pale.</li>
            <li> Best self-tanner I&#x27;ve ever used! Doesn&#x27;t smell and looks nautral. I&#x27;ve been buying it for years. I definitely recommend the product</li>
            <li> First off, this product did NOT spray on evenly. Even holding it two feet or so from my skin, the spray would hiss and speckle my skin in little dots of dark orange. Thus, you HAVE to spread it with your hands. You&#x27;ll need gloves; it&#x27;ll be difficult to wash your hands without creating streaks everywhere. If you think about spraying this on your face, don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several attempts to get the color even, and giving it ages to dry, I noticed anything white I got some friction against would start to look off color. And, the color itself wasn&#x27;t particularly brown. It looked orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did this in the shower, and it really made a mess everywhere. You can&#x27;t start cleaning it up until it dries, either...unless you want to wash the color off yourself too. Overall this product is not worth the hassle. If you&#x27;re looking for a self tanner, I&#x27;d recommend sticking to something less messy, like a lotion.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff!!  It is hands down the best spray tanner out there, and I have tried them ALL.  This is the only one that doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy, and doesn&#x27;t have that strong DHA smell to it.  It creates a very natural looking tan, has a nice fine mist, sprays in every direction, and smells like what I call &amp;#34;tropical chocolate&amp;#34;.  You can layer it on easily, which is great for correct farmer&#x27;s arms or weird tan lines.  It&#x27;s also easy to blend this by dabbing with a dark towel or washrag if you spray it on too heavily or make a mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my go-to tanner, and I always keep a few bottles in my closet.  Very highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product 4 times.  I love the way it looks and smells.  I have tried all types of sunless tanners from mousse to lotion, and this one is by far the best.  No streaking or blotchy spots.  I use it after exfoliating in the shower on my face, neck, and shoulders mostly.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT. THIS S THE FIRST TANNING SPRAY THAT DIDN&#x27;T LEAVE MY SKIN ORANGE !  IT WAS NICE BROWN AND IT DIDN&#x27;T HAVE THAT SELF TANNIING SMELL TO IT</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and I do use a tanning bed and this stuff is great! I use this in between or if I haven&#x27;t had time to go in days. Great stuff!!</li>
            <li> Read all the reviews, was super excited about this product. Easy to apply -- only reason why it even gets one star. Otherwise, the color is horrible. It&#x27;s like a red tan. Very fake looking. Super disappointed. And my skin tone is medium - just for those of you wondering.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as great as what other reviewers said. Neither of my bottles sprayed evenly &amp; I was left with tiny brown spots all over my arms &amp; hands.  I&#x27;ve used Neutrogenia spray mist tanner for awhile &amp; I&#x27;m going back to using that.</li>
            <li> smells like vanilla, cheaper then most spray tan bottles out there. so worth it. use on my face and body, give you bronze immediately and tan after time. great products</li>
            <li> Ordered this after my sister told me this is what she is using for her awesome (safe) tan.  I love it and will keep ordering.</li>
            <li> The best tanning spray !&lt;br /&gt;I do it in the shower . I don&#x27;t scrub my body because I am too lazy to do that ... I do apply moisturizer on my knees , elbows and other dry areas .&lt;br /&gt;The results are amazing !&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
            <li> Nice color but washes off if you shower to often</li>
            <li> Color turns out really good. Easy to use not a fan of the smell but not terrible</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd tanning spray I&#x27;ve used - the first was Versa Spa but it seemed expensive so I though I&#x27;d try a cheaper solution. The difference is in the quality of the spritzer. Versa Spa sprays a much lighter and more even mist, where as this one is a big clumpier and left spots which I didn&#x27;t experience with Versa Spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t think it holds as long, and have to reapply more frequently to even out my tan lines.</li>
            <li> Love it! Sprays on and I don&#x27;t even have to rub it on! Great color and looks natural!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great but very blotchy. I would recommend someone spray this on for you rather than yourself.</li>
            <li> This is the best quick tan It looks natural I get so many&lt;br /&gt;compliments.  I would strongly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;CT.</li>
            <li> Best self-tanner I&#x27;ve found yet. Natural looking, decent smelling, not streaky, and the color lasts. Adds several shades to any existing tan. I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> I like this. It smelled nice and gave a really nice color. I took off one star because I can&#x27;t use it consistently enough because I have to commit to cleaning the whole floor afterward. It&#x27;s hard floor and it didn&#x27;t stain it though and also it didn&#x27;t stain my socks from walking on it or the towels and t-shirt I used to wipe up the floor with(idk why I grabbed a shirt). Also the spray comes out kind of harshly so it&#x27;s easy to get a little spotty if you&#x27;re not careful but it wasn&#x27;t dramatic enough to be noticeable, just a minor change I&#x27;d recommend; changing the sprayer to come out a bit more seamlessly.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. Looks very realistic!</li>
