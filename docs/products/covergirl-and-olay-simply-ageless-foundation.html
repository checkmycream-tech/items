            <li>I always loved this</li>
            <li>PRODUCT IS A GOOD VALUE AND</li>
            <li>It has good coverage without being &amp;quot;cakey&amp;quot; -- and I now use Shade No. 205</li>
            <li>It can hold its own against foundations that are triple the price.</li>
            <li>and I liked how well it blended.</li>
            <li>Covers nicely and doesn&#x27;t look cakey.</li>
            <li>liked that it had SPF</li>
            <li>Stays on nicely.</li>
            <li>-- it is JUST RIGHT for very fair complexions.</li>
            <li>I love the product and it makes my skin looking smooth and beautiful.</li>
            <li>This is incredible make up at a reasonable price and customer service from this company was outstanding.</li>
            <li>It also would seep into my pores and make  them more noticeable, and that was with a primer applied before.</li>
            <li>it is okay  </li>
            <li>Love it and have used it for years.</li>
            <li>Love this makeup.</li>
            <li>For me, two good swipes around the container will cover my whole face.</li>
            <li>Works nicely if you know how to apply right.</li>
            <li>So easy to apply</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, fair skin.</li>
            <li>Plus, the customer service is super and I&#x27;m really pleased that I could buy the foundation for a reasonable price on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>It is a very silky and light foundation.</li>
            <li>This foundation offers very full coverage without looking chalky, and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>This color is not pink, it&#x27;s more yellowy or neutral.</li>
            <li>It has good coverage, or you can put it on lighter for a more sheer look or just in the spots you need a little make up.</li>
            <li>I also like the CG smoothers, but this is my current favorite.</li>
            <li>Usually I use a brush to put it on, but I&#x27;ve also used a sponge and that&#x27;s pretty good, too.</li>
            <li>It made my skin oily in certain spots.</li>
            <li>It also was very cakey on my chin, and made me break out a bit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m all ready to go in 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Really like this foundation from Cover Girl.</li>
            <li>Color is light enough, and doesn&#x27;t &amp;quot;sink into lines&amp;quot;, whatever that means.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Colors of their foundations are seem to suit me better than some of the other companies&#x27; foundations.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>and I also like that it offers anti- aging ingredients and sun protection.</li>
            <li>I gave it to my 15 year old daughter</li>
            <li>Does not irritate skin and looks completely natural.</li>
            <li>I actually like this better than some of the MAC foundations I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>And, light enough for my pale complexion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find drugstore type make-up light enough.</li>
            <li>It corrects tone and evens skin very nicely without giving that featureless look that I think is so creepy with heavy foundations.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> This is one of the best foundations I have ever purchased. It can hold its own against foundations that are triple the price. I actually like this better than some of the MAC foundations I have used in the past. This foundation offers very full coverage without looking chalky, and lasts all day. I only have to use a little bit to cover my entire face. I&#x27;m thirty and I also like that it offers anti- aging ingredients and sun protection.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like it, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me. It made my skin oily in certain spots. It also would seep into my pores and make  them more noticeable, and that was with a primer applied before. It also was very cakey on my chin, and made me break out a bit. I gave it to my 15 year old daughter, she seems to like it however, I can see that it looks a bit cakey on her as well.</li>
            <li> Works nicely if you know how to apply right. The color was perfect for me and I liked how well it blended.</li>
            <li> Always my go to foundation for years</li>
            <li> I have been using this foundation for years. I love the product and it makes my skin looking smooth and beautiful. Plus, the customer service is super and I&#x27;m really pleased that I could buy the foundation for a reasonable price on Amazon.com. Yes I will buy the foundation from this seller again!!!</li>
            <li> This is incredible make up at a reasonable price and customer service from this company was outstanding.</li>
            <li> Excellent coverage, never needs reapplying. Does not irritate skin and looks completely natural.</li>
            <li> such a waste of money. Too dark, actually it&#x27;s too &amp;#34;pinky&amp;#34;, too creamy. It&#x27;s not like a foundation but a lotion</li>
            <li> not worth the expense</li>
            <li> GREAT!!! I always loved this</li>
            <li> it is okay  a little too hard too spread</li>
            <li> PRODUCT IS A GOOD VALUE AND WORKS WELL.</li>
            <li> Love it and have used it for years. So easy to apply I&#x27;m all ready to go in 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Really like this foundation from Cover Girl. Covers nicely and doesn&#x27;t look cakey. Colors of their foundations are seem to suit me better than some of the other companies&#x27; foundations. The addition of the Olay gives it just enough moisture.</li>
            <li> only wish I could get it on the  subscribe and save program</li>
            <li> My wife works 18-hr. days.  She needs a foundation that &amp;quot;stays put&amp;quot;.  She swears by this.  Color is light enough, and doesn&#x27;t &amp;quot;sink into lines&amp;quot;, whatever that means. Thanks, Amazon. Here&#x27;s an update from &amp;quot;the wife&amp;quot; -- I continue to use this product because it WORKS.  It has good coverage without being &amp;quot;cakey&amp;quot; -- and I now use Shade No. 205 -- it is JUST RIGHT for very fair complexions. EXCELLENT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Great product and a wonderful purchase at an excellent price.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim since I had a coupon.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very different than I expected but I do like it a lot. It is a very silky and light foundation. For me, two good swipes around the container will cover my whole face. It corrects tone and evens skin very nicely without giving that featureless look that I think is so creepy with heavy foundations.&lt;br /&gt;I liked that it had SPF and it isn&#x27;t greasy like others I have used. I do get a bit oily but that&#x27;s just my skin and this doesn&#x27;t slide around. When I remove my makeup at the end of the day it&#x27;s all still there.&lt;br /&gt;I was very impressed with the staying power of this foundation.</li>
            <li> Did not care for product.  It left my face feeling dry.</li>
            <li> Used it for years so it is as usual</li>
            <li> Best  foundation out there, that I have found.  Highly recommend it.  usually only need to apply it once.  I have touched up occasionally if going out in evening.  But it is one that stays.</li>
            <li> Great foundation.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> We received it, my wife was happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, fair skin. It&#x27;s hard to find drugstore type make-up light enough. Or that doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel like it&#x27;s on fire. Usually I use a brush to put it on, but I&#x27;ve also used a sponge and that&#x27;s pretty good, too. It has good coverage, or you can put it on lighter for a more sheer look or just in the spots you need a little make up. It&#x27;s easier to work with in that way than a liquid. I also like the CG smoothers, but this is my current favorite. This color is not pink, it&#x27;s more yellowy or neutral. And, light enough for my pale complexion.</li>
            <li> Love this makeup. Goes on great and covers well. Stays on nicely.</li>
