            <li>I have found this product to be an effective tool.</li>
            <li>I may have just been drinking the water that I used to take with the capsules for all the more good</li>
            <li>I feel more energy just 1 week after taking ageloc, love this product!</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend you DO NOT order anything from this seller because you will have to jump though hoops if you happen to want to return the product for a refund!  </li>
            <li>After taking this for four weeks I noticed that I wake up better more rested, have more endurance throughout the day and my workouts don&#x27;t leave me feeling wiped out!  </li>
            <li>it sounds too good to be true, from our experience - it</li>
            <li>I plan on buying more and to keep useing it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>but I am able to get things done.</li>
            <li>Awesome product make you feel younger.</li>
            <li>This appears to be more of a placebo.</li>
            <li>OK, just a comment about who you deal with...</li>
            <li>I have more energy when I take these pills.  </li>
            <li>My dr recommended this product and I am so glad she did.</li>
            <li>Will refill for sure.</li>
            <li>I feel better and stronger now at this point in my life than ever.  </li>
            <li>I feel that confident on the Vitality, that I don&#x27;t even think to refill the prescription.  </li>
            <li>I have more energy,I am better focused and sleep all night and wake refreshed.</li>
            <li>It was supposed to give more energy - no; was supposed to improve memory - no; it was supposed to increase sex drive - no.  </li>
            <li>He stopped them and felt progressively better in the ensuing days.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We are SO pleased not to feel compelled to support Ageloc Vitality&#x27;s pyramid sales</li>
            <li>I have more energy and endurance than I have had in many years.</li>
            <li>I took four capsules, and the edge of fatigue vanished, and I felt pretty good</li>
            <li>Love the product and really believe the product improves my memory......and at 70 years old, that is GREAT!!!</li>
            <li>Told me I&#x27;d have much more energy, higher sex drive, better memory</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Great product, I feel healthier and younger since i started taking these</li>
            <li>due date is two more years, everyone in  my family take this and it works great</li>
            <li>I went thru a very stressful week and was able to handle it all quite calmly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Vitality is worth buying.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Most people notice a big difference in how well rested</li>
            <li>The company constantly works on eliminating these suppliers but there&#x27;s many of them out there.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I tried it, I had two jobs.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased I can get it online instead of paying twice that regular price.</li>
            <li>You just have to give it enough time for the magic to work.  </li>
            <li>My skin really does feel MUCH smoother - not just on my face but all over.</li>
            <li>Unbelieveable really.  </li>
            <li>Energy he whole day and is not an stimulant</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not noticed any increase in energy, in fact, I&#x27;m still feeling very fatigued.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Scientifically, there is nothing listed in the Ageloc Vitality contents to suggest that Ageloc Vitality would do much of anything one way of the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And NuSkin does not display their ingredients in a fashion that invites verification of their claims.</li>
            <li>I expect heavy traffic dings from AgeLoc distributors for being honest.</li>
            <li>I have used this product before and found it to be superior to other supplements in the anti-aging line and as I am fighting aging as much as possible</li>
            <li>&quot; This may suggest that the content of Ageloc Vitality is more of the \\&quot;other\\&quot; ingredients and less of the \\&quot;Vitality Blend.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After a couple of weeks you seen a steady increase in your level of energy.</li>
            <li>Shoppers, check out this product - it&#x27;s highly recommended by the health professionals.</li>
            <li>it suggests that the Ageloc Vitality ingredients are perhaps highly processed and manipulated.</li>
            <li>By the 4th day my thinking was more clear, I didn&#x27;t have the lazy lull, I began \\&quot;thinking\\&quot; and \\&quot;acting,\\&quot; taking care of long-awaited chores around the house, I stopped gasing my car at the last minute, and I perform better at work because my mind is CLEAR.  </li>
            <li>know customers are not unable to independently manufacture the side-effects of tinnitus.&lt;br /&gt;AND, I had not a single headache for many months prior to taking Ageloc Vitality.&lt;br /&gt;Moreover</li>
            <li>Really helps clear my head and keeps me focused</li>
            <li>customer is not provided with actual content information regarding ANY single ingredient, nor can the consumer distinguish if there is more filler content than \\&quot;vitality blend\\&quot; in each capsule.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am moving my right leg some but could never move my left.</li>
            <li>Dr. I went to was some new age wellness dr.</li>
            <li>Fine lines are less etc.</li>
            <li>If you want the product you can go directly to the website or look for a distributor near you!</li>
            <li>and I have noticed a HUGE difference in a few things.</li>
            <li>ago, my heart ultrasound was CLEAR ...</li>
            <li>Because the Vitality focuses on reversing the aging to the brain, heart and muscle, I truly believe in my heart that it had something to do with my ultrasound being so clear.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Secondly, the clear Ageloc Vitality capsules contain whitish-gray content.</li>
            <li>It has always been handled professionally.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tolerate stimulant type products very well and this has been like backing the clock up ten years!</li>
            <li>old son, Sean, truly believe in the NuSkin products.  </li>
            <li>Please do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>so far 2 week with this NuSkin,&lt;br /&gt;i can feel it it&#x27;s working on</li>
            <li>I purchased AgeLoc 180 capsules directly from Nu Skin&#x27;s Authorized distributor&#x27;s 800 number.</li>
            <li>It has broken through my own energy barrier, giving me a boost when I need it</li>
            <li>It very good for peoples have bad back.</li>
            <li>But most importantly, I have had asthma since my early 30&#x27;s ... very bad (allergic to flour) ...</li>
            <li>Also, as a powerful anti-oxidant, a few people report a minor headache, so you will want plenty of water and keep a headache remedy close just in case.&lt;br</li>

            <li> It has always been handled professionally.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tolerate stimulant type products very well and this has been like backing the clock up ten years!</li>
            <li> old son, Sean, truly believe in the NuSkin products.  </li>
            <li> Please do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> so far 2 week with this NuSkin,&lt;br /&gt;i can feel it it&#x27;s working on</li>
            <li> I purchased AgeLoc 180 capsules directly from Nu Skin&#x27;s Authorized distributor&#x27;s 800 number.</li>
            <li> It has broken through my own energy barrier, giving me a boost when I need it</li>
            <li> It very good for peoples have bad back.</li>
            <li> But most importantly, I have had asthma since my early 30&#x27;s ... very bad (allergic to flour) ...</li>
            <li> Also, as a powerful anti-oxidant, a few people report a minor headache, so you will want plenty of water and keep a headache remedy close just in case.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I told the seller that it made me sick and that I was concerned about my health and didn&#x27;t feel it was a good idea to continue taking the product.  </li>
            <li> Then they sent me a long questionnaire to answer some personal information.  </li>
            <li> NuSkin appears to employ a Multi-level marketing (MLM) marketing strategy in which the sales force is compensated not only for sales they personally generate, but also for the sales of the other salespeople that they recruit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, our empirical evidence shows Ageloc Vitality negatively affected my husband with a general malaise and stomach issues, and it affected me with headaches and ear</li>
            <li> short, I am planning on buying another bottle when this runs out but only locally as my local contact has no problem buying back the product if i&#x27;m not satisfied.</li>
            <li> However, results vary between people, depending on the dosage and how long you have been taking it for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Moreover, since titanium dioxide accounts for roughly 70 percent of the pigment used commercially on a global scale, there have been concerns raised over its toxicity in the workplace.</li>
            <li> No matter what I eat now, it&#x27;s sour, and I&#x27;m having digestive issues, which were not present prior to taking this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Generally, I don&#x27;t consume supplements whose ingredients are not clearly disclosed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They show two bottles, but you&#x27;re really only buying one, and, of course, paying for only half of what you thought you were buying.  </li>
            <li> other words, three capsules of Ageloc Vitality total 1135 mg.</li>
            <li> Or, since the additives listed as \\&quot;Other Ingredients\\&quot; include cellulose and titanium dioxide, a colorant used to make white paint, - In fact, titanium dioxide is one of the whitest materials known to exist on Earth, which has earned itthe nickname \\&quot;titanium white\\</li>
            <li> such, this 800# purchase would have FAILED my store shelf test at places like: Whole</li>
            <li> It improved my mental ability &amp; stamina.</li>
            <li> These vitamins are so expensive but you offered them at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I took the product for about 4-5 days, and contacted this seller to request a return of the product due to being disatisfied.  </li>
            <li> and I have ordered other products from other sellers on Amazon and have had no problems with any of them, even when I was disatisfied with a product and wanted to return it.  </li>
            <li> Usually, I&#x27;d wait until another day, but this time I took four capsules, and soon later I hit over 23 runs,</li>
            <li> Just generally not right.</li>
            <li> I had a car accident and am paralyzed from the waist down.  </li>
            <li> You will feel your energy levels slightly improve with time...</li>
            <li> Vitality is both subtle and essential.  </li>
            <li> Product did little, if any at all, to improve my vitality, and it had a noxious taste.</li>
            <li> I went to my second, afternoon job tired, but three Vitality capsules made me alert, but not jittery.  </li>
            <li> We both had been so stressed out and for some reason after taking this we feel recharge waking up everyday.  </li>
            <li> Then AgeLoc combines the total weight of one serving (three capsules) without any specific weight per ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chemical activity of this product is impossible to evaluate by design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cancer/Heart ultrasounds this past week ...</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is why</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a slow process that it takes to restore cellular activity in your DNA through its ingredients.</li>
            <li> I can still feel tired</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used this product before and found it to be superior to other supplements in the anti-aging line and as I am fighting aging as much as possible I have found this product to be an effective tool.</li>
            <li> The best source of mushroom completed supplement that I have found.  I plan on buying more and to keep useing it.</li>
            <li> I purchased mine locally for 50.00 a bottle. I take four tabs per day and I have noticed a HUGE difference in a few things. My skin really does feel MUCH smoother - not just on my face but all over. Like after a day at a spa. Fine lines are less etc. I have not noticed the surge in energy everybody talks about but I have had a sense of &#x27;well being&#x27; that is similar to anti depressants. I went thru a very stressful week and was able to handle it all quite calmly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I am planning on buying another bottle when this runs out but only locally as my local contact has no problem buying back the product if i&#x27;m not satisfied.</li>
            <li> Arrived in good time.  I use them every day!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It stops me from having the 3pm slump.  It does no make me jittery or anything.  I can still feel tired but I am able to get things done.</li>
            <li> I feel my skin smoother and even.</li>
            <li> I took the product for about 4-5 days, and contacted this seller to request a return of the product due to being disatisfied.  To my surprise, the seller, did not want to accept the product back since it had been opened. I told the seller that it made me sick and that I was concerned about my health and didn&#x27;t feel it was a good idea to continue taking the product.  They said they would  have to contact the manufacturer. Then they sent me a long questionnaire to answer some personal information.  I told the seller that I did&#x27;nt feel comfortable answering some of the information and that I did not understand why they do not stand behind a product that they sell. And if they need to deal with the manufacturer, they should do so once they take care of me, the customer.  I have never ever been told that I have to answer a manufacturer&#x27;s questions in order to get a refund of a product that I have purchased online or in a store!  I find it absurd.  Unbelieveable really.  I have not heard back from this seller letting me know they will accomodate my request for a return.  I am very very disappointed and I have ordered other products from other sellers on Amazon and have had no problems with any of them, even when I was disatisfied with a product and wanted to return it.  It has always been handled professionally.  I strongly recommend you DO NOT order anything from this seller because you will have to jump though hoops if you happen to want to return the product for a refund!  I guess I will be taking a loss on this order and $60 is nothing to sneeze at, especially this time of the year!  Follow-up - It is the end of February 2011 and I never heard back from this seller.  I would recommend that no one order anything from this seller since they obviously offer no customer service or satisfaction whatsoever!</li>
            <li> They show two bottles, but you&#x27;re really only buying one, and, of course, paying for only half of what you thought you were buying.  When you contact them, they say that they are in the process of changing the image, but it hasn&#x27;t changed at all!  I contacted the seller but got no response until I reported the problem to Amazon.  Then they (the sellers) said they had contacted me (I never got an email) and that they were changing their image.  Humpf.</li>
            <li> Best energy with no side effects</li>
            <li> Awesome product make you feel younger. This company resets youth gene clusters. Vitality is worth buying. Energy he whole day and is not an stimulant</li>
            <li> The product is incredible. However, results vary between people, depending on the dosage and how long you have been taking it for. Most people notice a big difference in how well rested they are when they wake up and how they never feel drowzy throughout the day. It&#x27;s NOT an energy boost!! You will feel your energy levels slightly improve with time... It&#x27;s a slow process that it takes to restore cellular activity in your DNA through its ingredients. There IS tons of science behind it.  HOWEVER!!!! DO NOT BUY IT ON AMAZON!!! While the company does accept product returns, it is illegal to sell this product on Amazon or ebay or anything of that nature, therefore something bought on these sites cannot be returned!!!  The company constantly works on eliminating these suppliers but there&#x27;s many of them out there. If you want the product you can go directly to the website or look for a distributor near you!</li>
            <li> After taking this for four weeks I noticed that I wake up better more rested, have more endurance throughout the day and my workouts don&#x27;t leave me feeling wiped out!  This isn&#x27;t a energy boost type of product, but rather just very good supplement that seems to help me metabolize better.  I can&#x27;t tolerate stimulant type products very well and this has been like backing the clock up ten years!</li>
            <li> Did not work at all for me. This appears to be more of a placebo. They are making money on folks like us.</li>
            <li> Why are you ako buying from This seller. Nuskin has great products and √çr you register with them on top of the lower price u get 20% product points which you can use for your next purchase</li>
            <li> OK, just a comment about who you deal with... DO NOT PURCHASE from these people.  The are not approved to sell by the company!</li>
            <li> due date is two more years, everyone in  my family take this and it works great give you energy too</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I take in addition to my regular vitamin. After a couple of weeks you seen a steady increase in your level of energy. I would definitely recommend it.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for over one year.</li>
            <li> I am taking it since 2 years ago and it help me with back pain.  I only take two pills a day and its enough for what I need.</li>
            <li> A great supplement for the immune system made by a quality company. Shoppers, check out this product - it&#x27;s highly recommended by the health professionals.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic. I have more energy when I take these pills.  My dr recommended this product and I am so glad she did.</li>
            <li> Dr. I went to was some new age wellness dr. In my opinion he is a vitamin, testosterone pellet pusher.  Told me I&#x27;d have much more energy, higher sex drive, better memory etc if I took these vitamins and the nano pak. Took for a month and no change in anything. Won&#x27;t go back to this dr. and won&#x27;t be buying these outrageously priced vitamins.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on Vitality for a week, and I&#x27;ve been having a horrible metal-like taste in my mouth.  No matter what I eat now, it&#x27;s sour, and I&#x27;m having digestive issues, which were not present prior to taking this product.  I&#x27;ve not noticed any increase in energy, in fact, I&#x27;m still feeling very fatigued. It&#x27;s weird.  Has anyone else had a similar experience?</li>
            <li> Tons of energy from these pills! They are great</li>
            <li> I have been using this now for awhile and I am actually getting feeling back in my left leg. I had a car accident and am paralyzed from the waist down.  I am moving my right leg some but could never move my left. Well since taking these I have some movement in my left leg.</li>
            <li> My anti aging doctor tells me I must take this.  I take 6 of these each day and feel wonderful. Will refill for sure.</li>
            <li> I, and my 30yr. old son, Sean, truly believe in the NuSkin products.  We have been taking the NuSkin Vitality for approximately 9 months now.  My short-term results were the same as what I have been reading ... By the 4th day my thinking was more clear, I didn&#x27;t have the lazy lull, I began \\&quot;thinking\\&quot; and \\&quot;acting,\\&quot; taking care of long-awaited chores around the house, I stopped gasing my car at the last minute, and I perform better at work because my mind is CLEAR.  These results I am still having.  My son is a Personal Trainer at Gold&#x27;s Gym L.A., and I myself workout quite regularly ... we started basically noticing that one workout equals two!  We began having longer and stronger workouts, and could see muscles developing quicker.  I feel better and stronger now at this point in my life than ever.  My son has noticed the same results.  But most importantly, I have had asthma since my early 30&#x27;s ... very bad (allergic to flour) ... I use my steroid inhaler regularly, but my emergency inhaler, which I used twice a day every day for 10 years ... I have not used it for over 6 months now and I have not refilled my prescription.  I feel that confident on the Vitality, that I don&#x27;t even think to refill the prescription.  Vitality changed my life.  I just had Cancer/Heart ultrasounds this past week ... and while I stopped eating red meat 10yrs. ago, my heart ultrasound was CLEAR ... I could not believe that the technician could see no plague in my arteries.  Because the Vitality focuses on reversing the aging to the brain, heart and muscle, I truly believe in my heart that it had something to do with my ultrasound being so clear.  I was so nervous at 50 before the test, but so happy afterwards.  You just have to remember, to get results, you have to commit to taking the product regularly ... make it a part of your DNA.  I, and my son, believe in NuSkin.</li>
            <li> The product was recommended to me by a friend.  Product did little, if any at all, to improve my vitality, and it had a noxious taste.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I am having great results.....I have more energy,I am better focused and sleep all night and wake refreshed. BUT...what is the expiration date on bottles? A must know</li>
            <li> Ageloc Vitality is truly an amazing alternative energy product.  As an educator, I have been known to jolt myself with constant caffeine products throughout the day.  Vitality is both subtle and essential.  It has broken through my own energy barrier, giving me a boost when I need it most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried it, I had two jobs.  I went to my second, afternoon job tired, but three Vitality capsules made me alert, but not jittery.  Since then, I can remember working at a school&#x27;s zero hour at 6:50, and I was in those modes when you are so tired it&#x27;s painful.  I took four capsules, and the edge of fatigue vanished, and I felt pretty good the rest of the day.  Another time I woke up with only six hours of sleep before skiing.  (I hate hitting the slopes bushed.)  Usually, I&#x27;d wait until another day, but this time I took four capsules, and soon later I hit over 23 runs, feeling like I did when I was eleven years younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some things you should know.  Vitality is all-natural. While you may find two of the ingredients anywhere, the patented combination make this product ahead of its time.  It should be noted that cordyceps mushrooms is patented and was used by some Nepal Olympians to give them a boost that went under the officials&#x27; radars.  The directions state you should take three capsules twice daily.  As you can imagine, a six foot, three man and a petite woman will not have the same results, so some people tweak the dosage.  Also, as a powerful anti-oxidant, a few people report a minor headache, so you will want plenty of water and keep a headache remedy close just in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NuSkin has some awesome anti-aging products.  With their galvanic facial demonstrations showing visible reductions in lines and wrinkles and a bio-photonic scanner measuring anti-oxidant scores from the skin, NuSkin is a leading-edge company for personal health and beauty products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Check out the NuSkin website.  You can get Internet discounts and ADR (auto-delivery rewards) points through a local distributor.  I know next to anything about this purveyor.)</li>
            <li> Been using for awhile now. Really helps clear my head and keeps me focused</li>
            <li> The product does not deliver any of things that it promises.  It was supposed to give more energy - no; was supposed to improve memory - no; it was supposed to increase sex drive - no.  I may have just been drinking the water that I used to take with the capsules for all the more good this item did.  Please do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> Have been using the product for years. It improved my mental ability &amp; stamina. It also improved my visual acuity.</li>
            <li> so far 2 week with this NuSkin,&lt;br /&gt;i can feel it it&#x27;s working on me.&lt;br /&gt;my skin is great, inside and out i can tell this thing is working.</li>
            <li> Love the product and really believe the product improves my memory......and at 70 years old, that is GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> Always a good product</li>
            <li> I purchased AgeLoc 180 capsules directly from Nu Skin&#x27;s Authorized distributor&#x27;s 800 number. NuSkin appears to employ a Multi-level marketing (MLM) marketing strategy in which the sales force is compensated not only for sales they personally generate, but also for the sales of the other salespeople that they recruit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I expect heavy traffic dings from AgeLoc distributors for being honest. Bring it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon receipt of Ageloc Vitality, I noted they do not disclose actual ingredient content by weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather, AgeLoc lists ALL ingredients in a sentence format. Then AgeLoc combines the total weight of one serving (three capsules) without any specific weight per ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chemical activity of this product is impossible to evaluate by design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Their \\&quot;active\\&quot; ingredient(s) could be only one pea on a plate of potatoes. OR, it might vary greatly per lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words, three capsules of Ageloc Vitality total 1135 mg. (this does not divide by three, by the way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The customer is not provided with actual content information regarding ANY single ingredient, nor can the consumer distinguish if there is more filler content than \\&quot;vitality blend\\&quot; in each capsule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally, I don&#x27;t consume supplements whose ingredients are not clearly disclosed.&lt;br /&gt;As such, this 800# purchase would have FAILED my store shelf test at places like: Whole Foods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the clear Ageloc Vitality capsules contain whitish-gray content. Since their \\&quot;active\\&quot; ingredients are described to include mushrooms, which are brown, - and pomegranate, which is crimson (think grenadine) it suggests that the Ageloc Vitality ingredients are perhaps highly processed and manipulated. Or, since the additives listed as \\&quot;Other Ingredients\\&quot; include cellulose and titanium dioxide, a colorant used to make white paint, - In fact, titanium dioxide is one of the whitest materials known to exist on Earth, which has earned itthe nickname \\&quot;titanium white\\&quot; This may suggest that the content of Ageloc Vitality is more of the \\&quot;other\\&quot; ingredients and less of the \\&quot;Vitality Blend.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, since titanium dioxide accounts for roughly 70 percent of the pigment used commercially on a global scale, there have been concerns raised over its toxicity in the workplace. In response, a number of global agencies have advised manufacturers to update material safety data sheets and occupational hazard training programs based on current safety reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding Ageloc Vitality&#x27;s Odor of which some have complained;&lt;br /&gt;~ In our product the odor resembled coconut scent and was not objectionable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to their effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;~ My spouse took Ageloc Vitality as directed (two capsules, three times daily.) After a week he noted that he wasn&#x27;t feeling quite well. Just generally not right. He stopped them and felt progressively better in the ensuing days. After three weeks he tried Ageloc Vitality again and within two days (12 capsules), his stomach was nauseous again. The nausea left when he stopped taking Ageloc Vitality the second time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ageloc Vitality affected me differently.&lt;br /&gt;~ I began with only one capsule of Ageloc Vitality at night and I woke up with a headache and fierce tinnitus. (ear ringing). I waited two weeks and tried another Ageloc Vitality capsule with an identical result after only one capsule of Ageloc Vitality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know customers are not unable to independently manufacture the side-effects of tinnitus.&lt;br /&gt;AND, I had not a single headache for many months prior to taking Ageloc Vitality.&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, my ears remained affected for days after taking this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scientifically, there is nothing listed in the Ageloc Vitality contents to suggest that Ageloc Vitality would do much of anything one way of the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And NuSkin does not display their ingredients in a fashion that invites verification of their claims. I felt foolish buying them. Nonetheless, our empirical evidence shows Ageloc Vitality negatively affected my husband with a general malaise and stomach issues, and it affected me with headaches and ear ringing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are SO pleased not to feel compelled to support Ageloc Vitality&#x27;s pyramid sales commissions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THAT FEELS GOOD!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it sounds too good to be true, from our experience - it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- - - - -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TODAY&#x27;S CURRENT Price: $41.75.......It was $70.00 ONLY TWO HOURS AGO from various suppliers on this site!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Today&#x27;s price, $33.00.</li>
            <li> These vitamins are so expensive but you offered them at a very reasonable price. I searched everywhere and you offered the best price.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
            <li> I always oder this supriment!</li>
            <li> I feel more energy just 1 week after taking ageloc, love this product!</li>
            <li> Great product, I feel healthier and younger since i started taking these</li>
            <li> I am pleased I can get it online instead of paying twice that regular price.</li>
            <li> I have more energy and endurance than I have had in many years. Not sure if this is why but all happened shortly after I started taking this product daily</li>
            <li> It very good for peoples have bad back.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!  I love it!  It helped me and my boyfriend.  We both had been so stressed out and for some reason after taking this we feel recharge waking up everyday.  You just have to give it enough time for the magic to work.  Thank you nuskin for this product!</li>
