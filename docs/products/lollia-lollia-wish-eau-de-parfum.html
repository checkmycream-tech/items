            <li>it&#x27;s gorgeous  </li>

            <li>Reminds me of a vanilla candle(in a good way)</li>
            <li>As a side note, Bath &amp; Body Works Coconut Lime Breeze is an excellent companion to this fragrance in bodywash and lotion, as the lime fades fairly quickly.</li>

            <li>Believe is really nice also.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great service I got for my order also!!</li>
            <li>I do like the \\&quot;Believe Cabbage Rose and</li>
            <li>Was expecting item to arrive in a box suitable for gift giving.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like most perfumes, but this one is just the right blend.......smells lovely without being overpowering!!</li>
            <li>The bottle is beautiful, and the scent is light and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I wear this every day and love it.</li>
            <li>i love it for summer.</li>
            <li>and I just love it.  </li>
            <li>love it, and so does she.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>Just lovely perfume...</li>
            <li>protection during shipment could have been better.  </li>
            <li>Hints of honey, which is why I would imagine there is a bee on the bottle :)  </li>
            <li>Like the scent, don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I also gifted a bottle to my daughter.</li>
            <li>If you like the smell of baby powder and cream, but don&#x27;t want to smell like a stripper, then you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten tons of compliments on it :)</li>
            <li>My favorite scents.</li>
            <li>It has a very unique smell.  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice perfume with a wonderful scent that is subtle and has sort of deeper, spicy notes...not flowery.</li>
            <li>The bottle is gorgeous (as are all of the Lollia bottles) and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>Got the mini Wish parfum, decided after wearing a week that I love it, upgraded to the large bottle, which is a good value on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Definitely not disappointed!</li>
            <li>It came on time as expected and the price was excellent.</li>
            <li>Got the lotion before and loved it so much I bought the perfume.</li>
            <li>I Love the unique smell of this perfume...</li>
            <li>However, it was exactly what I ordered, and I love it now that I have it!</li>
            <li>Love the scent but the lasting power isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so beautiful and different.</li>
            <li>Very refreshing to find a *new* scent - literally!</li>
            <li>It has a strong honey presence (as indicated by the golden bees on the bottle!)</li>
            <li>nice...packaged secure.</li>
            <li>The closest description I have is it starts out with a bright floral/honey scent &amp; mellows to a soft vanilla like fragrance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light, &amp;#34;happy&amp;#34; fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a favorite perfume for a long time &amp; was looking for something good.</li>
            <li>Discovered in a unique art/furniture/clothing store, which no longer carries it, which is why I sought it online.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft and a great simple perfume for the price - love!</li>
            <li>Sugary and clean.</li>
            <li>Sweet memories of the seashore and romance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting rave reviews from women and men about how much they love the scent</li>
            <li>It is just SO sweet that it has come to grate on me.</li>
            <li>Whether you prefer this or Kenzo Amour depends on your sweet tooth.</li>
            <li>and it is sweet, but floral as well.</li>
            <li>It works very well with her PH, and is sweet, but not sickeningly so, and</li>
            <li>This is by far one of the most unique smells</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of Kenzo Amour&#x27;s rice and vanilla, and I at first really enjoyed how this scent made rice and vanilla even more cuddly.</li>
            <li>but I am happy that it sticks around for a while since it is not cheap.</li>
            <li>love it when they come early....</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my girlfriend as a Christmas present, based upon recommendations by siblings and others, as well as her own fondness of the product.  </li>
            <li>is ok, too if that gives you a sense of the type of fragrances these are similar to.</li>
            <li>Wish is such a lovely scent.</li>
            <li>:)  Adding this to our recommended products in l&amp;l&#x27;s &amp;#34;Apothecary&amp;#34; digital magazine today.  </li>
            <li>I tried it out recently in a boutique, and it seemed a little strong at first (as all perfumes do) but it mellowed nicely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overpowering but still strong enough to smell throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I thought I liked this at first, but after wearing for a few hours it gave me a headache--</li>
            <li>I am a hard one to peg for scents, and most of the popular ones smell similar and don&#x27;t inspire me.</li>
            <li>very feminine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it has a bit too much fragrance for me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Product shipped fast and was well packaged.  </li>
            <li>Smells gorgeous--strong, but not overpowering, and far more affordable than my other current favorite scent by Hermes.</li>
            <li>Not too over powering and not the granny potent smell of other dept store luxury perfumes.</li>
            <li>scent is unique and hard to describe, but I would say there are some hints of vanilla in it, though it is not too sweet and not too floral</li>
            <li>This scent is actually several layers of scents, hard to disseminate the different smells, but combined they make a very lovely earthy, fresh, feminine scent that I was totally surprised to like so much.</li>
            <li>very very soft scent.....</li>
            <li>it is, but it&#x27;s still a little overly powerful-- similar to a strong vanilla/musk, though the scent is more complex than vanilla.    </li>
            <li>Very late ( like more than 2 weeks after they said it had been delivered)!</li>
            <li>I typically don&#x27;t like most perfumes (like department store brands), and was hoping this was different--</li>
            <li>Arrived 1 day early....</li>
            <li>Too sweet, and smells like black licorice to me.</li>
            <li>Not too sweet, heavy, or overpowering.</li>
            <li>smells a little like honey and vanilla, also very beachy smelling</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The scent lasted a really long time in the creme</li>
            <li> I like how it smells so different than other perfumes.  </li>
            <li> I also purchased the hand cream which keeps my hands from getting dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> not really a winter scent.</li>
            <li> Think of Pink Sugar with a kick.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like any other perfume I&#x27;ve known.</li>
            <li> and it fits my \\&quot;Anthropology\\&quot; fashion style, low-key, down to earth personality.</li>
            <li> But over time, I have gotten to like this less.</li>
            <li> they are lighter and less perfumy.  </li>
            <li> One of the few perfumes that don&#x27;t make me sneeze.</li>
            <li> Childish scent.</li>
            <li> If I could describe it in a few words, it would be: vanilla cupcakes, and an ocean breeze.  </li>
            <li> Been wearing a few years.</li>
            <li> I purchased a small bottle to check this out &amp; find I wear it so often</li>
            <li> A lot of fragrances give me headaches so it is hard for me to find ones that I like.</li>
            <li> so its hard to review that, either you like it or not,</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is a very nice perfume with a wonderful scent that is subtle and has sort of deeper, spicy notes...not flowery. A lot of fragrances give me headaches so it is hard for me to find ones that I like. My husband loves it. The bottle is beautiful too! When I actually make it through the entire bottle I will be buying again.</li>

I purchased a small bottle to check this out &amp; find I wear it so often it&#x27;s time to go for the big one!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s gorgeous  i love it for summer. not really a winter scent.</li>
            <li> I ordered this from your web site and I just love it.  I&#x27;m getting rave reviews from women and men about how much they love the scent and they always ask me what the name of the scent is and where I purchased it.  Thanks for the great service I got for my order also!! Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Was expecting item to arrive in a box suitable for gift giving.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the most unique smells I&#x27;ve ever had the pleasure of encountering. The best way I can describe it, is a mix of sugar, vanilla and this ironically delicious musky smell. It&#x27;s so beautiful and different.</li>
            <li> I love this scent! I was at a friends house and she had the hand creme in this scent and I tried it and loved it. The scent lasted a really long time in the creme so I was hoping the perfume would also and It does.  Scent is such a subjective thing so its hard to review that, either you like it or not, but I am happy that it sticks around for a while since it is not cheap.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! It came on time as expected and the price was excellent. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Too sweet, and smells like black licorice to me. Childish scent.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume!  It has a very unique smell.  If I could describe it in a few words, it would be: vanilla cupcakes, and an ocean breeze.  The scent sticks with me all day.  I like how it smells so different than other perfumes.  The bottle is very beautiful too.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Kenzo Amour&#x27;s rice and vanilla, and I at first really enjoyed how this scent made rice and vanilla even more cuddly. The bottle is gorgeous (as are all of the Lollia bottles) and the price is very reasonable. But over time, I have gotten to like this less. It is just SO sweet that it has come to grate on me. The fact that the label refers to \\&quot;sugar pastilles\\&quot; - well, they aren&#x27;t kidding. Whether you prefer this or Kenzo Amour depends on your sweet tooth.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my girlfriend as a Christmas present, based upon recommendations by siblings and others, as well as her own fondness of the product.  It works very well with her PH, and is sweet, but not sickeningly so, and very feminine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it, and so does she.</li>
            <li> I Love the unique smell of this perfume... It&#x27;s not overpowering but still strong enough to smell throughout the day. It&#x27;s a lot of perfume for the price!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume. Discovered in a unique art/furniture/clothing store, which no longer carries it, which is why I sought it online. Smells gorgeous--strong, but not overpowering, and far more affordable than my other current favorite scent by Hermes. Another bonus: this fragrance lasts all day. Plus, the bottle is beautiful.</li>
            <li> Love the scent but the lasting power isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li> Just lovely perfume...protection during shipment could have been better.  Hints of honey, which is why I would imagine there is a bee on the bottle :)  I get tons of compliments.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and that is what makes me happy.</li>
            <li> I thought I liked this at first, but after wearing for a few hours it gave me a headache-- it has a bit too much fragrance for me.  I typically don&#x27;t like most perfumes (like department store brands), and was hoping this was different-- it is, but it&#x27;s still a little overly powerful-- similar to a strong vanilla/musk, though the scent is more complex than vanilla.    I do like the \\&quot;Believe Cabbage Rose and Citrus\\&quot; and \\&quot;1000 Flowers\\&quot; scents from the same brand though-- they are lighter and less perfumy.  I also like Tokyo Milk perfumes and Amazing Grace is ok, too if that gives you a sense of the type of fragrances these are similar to.</li>
            <li> Like the scent, don&#x27;t love it. A bit too coconutty and immature.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments and It&#x27;s perfect because it&#x27;s not a heavy/obnoxious parfum. This is my second bottle and I will continue to buy. thank you!</li>
            <li> This is a great light and beachy scent! It&#x27;s super soft and a great simple perfume for the price - love!</li>
            <li> Got the lotion before and loved it so much I bought the perfume. Definitely not disappointed!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. This is my second time ordering it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is unique and hard to describe, but I would say there are some hints of vanilla in it, though it is not too sweet and not too floral either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product shipped fast and was well packaged.  Good all the way around!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very pleasant fragrance...with vanilla. Reminds me of a vanilla candle(in a good way) Also, very long lasting on my skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like any other perfume I&#x27;ve known. It smells maybe like mist in the woods - earthy not flowery, a bit musky. I like it and it fits my \\&quot;Anthropology\\&quot; fashion style, low-key, down to earth personality. I also gifted a bottle to my daughter.</li>
            <li> Wish it came with the box</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume since the 7th grade. I haven&#x27;t found anything I&#x27;d rather wear, smells so amazing! :]</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like most perfumes, but this one is just the right blend.......smells lovely without being overpowering!!</li>
            <li> I received the perfume and hand lotion with shea butter as a gift for Christmas. I am a hard one to peg for scents, and most of the popular ones smell similar and don&#x27;t inspire me. This scent is actually several layers of scents, hard to disseminate the different smells, but combined they make a very lovely earthy, fresh, feminine scent that I was totally surprised to like so much. Very refreshing to find a *new* scent - literally!</li>
            <li> LoLLia Wish is such a lovely scent. I tried it out recently in a boutique, and it seemed a little strong at first (as all perfumes do) but it mellowed nicely. Both my sister and I agreed it reminded us somehow of being at the beach. It has a strong honey presence (as indicated by the golden bees on the bottle!) and it is sweet, but floral as well. It also has a not-quite-coconut-sort-of-vanilla note, which is what&#x27;s seeming beachy to me. As a side note, Bath &amp; Body Works Coconut Lime Breeze is an excellent companion to this fragrance in bodywash and lotion, as the lime fades fairly quickly. As the lotion settles in, it smells almost identical to Wish. Got the mini Wish parfum, decided after wearing a week that I love it, upgraded to the large bottle, which is a good value on Amazon. Happy perfuming!</li>
            <li> Very late ( like more than 2 weeks after they said it had been delivered)! I was quite upset. However, it was exactly what I ordered, and I love it now that I have it!</li>
            <li> They had my attention at Italian Bergamot  and cinched the deal with Amber Woods.  :)  Adding this to our recommended products in l&amp;l&#x27;s &amp;#34;Apothecary&amp;#34; digital magazine today.  It&#x27;s a light, &amp;#34;happy&amp;#34; fragrance.  ~L</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PERFUME!!!!!!!!!!!! Best perfume for the price and I adore the smell!! Can&#x27;t get enough! I wear this daily.</li>
            <li> The bottle is beautiful, and the scent is light and fresh.  If you like the smell of baby powder and cream, but don&#x27;t want to smell like a stripper, then you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li> Perfect summer scent !! Smells like the beach with just a hint of floral and coconut. I&#x27;ve gotten tons of compliments on it :)</li>
            <li> My favorite scents. Been wearing a few years. Not too over powering and not the granny potent smell of other dept store luxury perfumes. Think of Pink Sugar with a kick.</li>
            <li> Love the smell! Great purchase through a great seller!!</li>
            <li> Bought for a birthday gift for my daughter.  I loved it myself!  May have to order one for me.</li>
