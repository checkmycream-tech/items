            <li>None of the replacement models looked very good to me, so I was extremely happy to find these reburbished ones on Amazon.  </li>

            <li>great trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>lol)</li>
            <li>Longevity is tbd, but happy I found a suitable replacement!</li>
            <li>And It still works good today</li>
            <li>Perhaps it was too good a product.</li>
            <li>and I really loved the MB-70.</li>
            <li>Still a good buy if you can find it under 20-25 bucks.  </li>
            <li>My husband has loved this product and I can&#x27;t  believe that Remington no longer provides this product.</li>
            <li>and I loved it.</li>
            <li>SO FOR IT IS DOING A GOOD JOB ON MAY HEAD...</li>
            <li>I was absolutely delighted to find factory reconditioned MB-70&#x27;s available and at a great price to boot.</li>
            <li>Love that it vacuums!</li>
            <li>Great product - easy to use for do-it-yourself buzz cuts, and it keeps all the trimmed hair</li>
            <li>The feel and look are also amazing, which is an added bonus.</li>
            <li>but, Hey, 2 trimmers over 17-18 years...don&#x27;t know where you find that kind of longevity for anything anymore...</li>
            <li>I have been thrilled with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Nice product, as advertised, delivered as promised</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for access to this wonderful one of a kind product.</li>
            <li>I bought my original MB-70 10 or 12 years ago and have received great service all these years.</li>
            <li>The new one works great and is a joy to use when trimming my beard.  </li>
            <li>The MB-30 worked alot better.</li>
            <li>OK.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it</li>
            <li>You can pay a lot more money, but you won&#x27;t find a better, easier to use beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>I was really glad to be able to find</li>
            <li>I have owned this product for a number years and Remington does not make it any more.</li>
            <li>It picks up most of the cut hair,and that&#x27;s what I like the most.</li>
            <li>It really does a great job.</li>
            <li>So glad that we were able to find a replacement for the one my husband had for 8-10 years.</li>
            <li>An ingenious idea.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer works faster and the vacuum unit works flawlessly.</li>
            <li>and so will the person whose turn it is to clean the bathroom!</li>
            <li>Works well, is reliable, and easy to maintain.  </li>
            <li>But then battery died and I found that it is not that easy to replace the battery and that they do not produce them anymore.</li>
            <li>I love it because I don&#x27;t have to clean hair out of the sink anymore.  </li>
            <li>Looked for this beard trimmer forever in stores after the first one kind of burned out and would not hold a charge.</li>
            <li>The factory refurb works just as good as the original and holds a charge for much longer.</li>
            <li>The unit still works just fine on my beard.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not too comfortable.   </li>
            <li>Cheap junk.</li>
            <li>Quality not as good as my old one, but use it every week for a short goatee and works great</li>
            <li>The comb guard is cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li>My old one is vastly superior to this Remington junk.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Originally I bought it years and years ago</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d clean it for him,and I broke it.  </li>
            <li>Works great and is pretty quiet.</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace my old worn out one and this new one works great.</li>
            <li>Glad I found this on Amazon.com and it looks brand new.</li>
            <li>Few parts to loose and does a great job, and surprisingly inexpensive.</li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth you won&#x27;t be upset with your purchase.</li>
            <li>I bought the only two available to be sure I&#x27;d have a working trimmer for years to come.  </li>
            <li>I replaced my old vacuuming trimmer with this one, so far I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Charges fast and holds that charge for a good long time.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>I was distraught as this is the best one ive ever used and makes cleanup much easier than most.</li>
            <li>I have had my close cropped beard (#2 of 10 settings)for 30+ years and, due to a great vacuum system that you clean (dump out from the bottom) once a week,</li>
            <li>I had purchased one of these about 10 years ago when they first came out.</li>
            <li>I bought this item to replace the one I&#x27;d bought ten or more years ago and had worn out.   </li>
            <li>But, overall it is ok .</li>
            <li>I bought it for him for Christmas (more of a present for myself, I guess.  </li>
            <li>Not so much for shaving your head.&lt;br /&gt;Great battery life and shaped just right for the job.</li>
            <li>I was not able to find anything, at any price, that appeared to be as good as the MB-70.</li>
            <li>The guide is a VERY flexible/flimsy and if you&#x27;re not careful you can easily put a whole or two in your beard/mustache.</li>
            <li>Remington also uses a good rechargeable battery, it keeps a charge for quite a while (certainly long enough for a 5-7 day business trip).</li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s still running strong 9 months later.  </li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t fine one with the vacuum</li>
            <li>The motor on it is much stronger.</li>
            <li>It really bogs done when it hits some whiskers and that winds up pulling your beard</li>
            <li>My thanks to the anonymous rebuilder for a job well done.    </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I did not have much of a choice and purchased one.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>Had one of the trimmers and used it so much</li>
            <li>It also has a very nice vacuum ability that keeps you from making a mess of the bathroom when you trim your beard.  </li>
            <li>It cuts your hair and has a good guard but the vacuum leaves a little to be desired (still alot of hair in and around the sink when I&#x27;m done) and it&#x27;s pretty bulky.  </li>
            <li>Other than these two issues, I love the razor.  </li>
            <li>Other trimmers work better for that.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like brand new!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product as long as it is available.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying a whole new unit.  </li>
            <li>I stopped being able to take it on trips after about a year &amp; a half.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Unit still works just fine for shaving but battery is pretty much dead.  </li>
            <li>The box had a very faded picture on it but who cares about the old box it just gets recycled.</li>
            <li>But I do have to oil it much more often (almost every time I use it) and have it sharpened every few months instead of once a year.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is good but not great.  </li>
            <li>The unit is fresh, seems like new and definitely runs like my ol&#x27; faithful</li>
            <li>so when I was looking to see if they had a new model out there</li>
            <li>The batteries cost almost as much as a new timmer</li>
            <li>than that it comes as promised factory refurbished as new.</li>
            <li>However, it was advertised as new but when I received it it was described as refurbished.  </li>
            <li>The refurb looks and acts like a new one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying a new Norelco Turbo-Vac instead.</li>
            <li>so this purchase was a re-manufactured one and it came fully charged and looked new.</li>
            <li>To my surprise it looks and works as well as a new one</li>
            <li>I wore it out and had to buy a new one ...</li>
            <li>It just makes the MB-70 bulkier and less easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>I may try and take the batteries from this new one and put them in the old one.</li>
            <li>The only positive thing about this product is that it came on time</li>
            <li>So far this product has served it&#x27;s purpose, and I have zero complaints.</li>
            <li>Old trimmer wore out, beard didn&#x27;t, tried a couple of others and then found this.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much to choose from if you want a vacuum trimmer so beggers can&#x27;t be choosers.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum really helps a lot.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s is no mess at all</li>
            <li>He tried several others that didn&#x27;t do as fine a job, and made a mess in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>This new one will probably last for years, but I hope there&#x27;s another one -</li>
            <li>I finally found the new one , works as&lt;br /&gt;well</li>
            <li>I hope the new one lasts as long as the old one did.</li>
            <li>My old locally bought MB-70 way over  5 - 7  years ago</li>
            <li>If you have a full beard and are tired of sweeping up the hair after you use your razor/trimmer, I whole heartedly recommend this unit.  </li>
            <li>This leads me to fear that its life my not as long as a new product.</li>
            <li>Does not hold a charge very long which is why I bought to replace an old Remington mb70</li>
            <li>I have a pretty dense beard and it gets really messy to trim it with the regular trimmer.</li>
            <li>but I ended up having to do just as much clean up around the sink - less volume but still just as messy.</li>

            <li> It also has a very nice vacuum ability that keeps you from making a mess of the bathroom when you trim your beard.  </li>
            <li> It cuts your hair and has a good guard but the vacuum leaves a little to be desired (still alot of hair in and around the sink when I&#x27;m done) and it&#x27;s pretty bulky.  </li>
            <li> Other than these two issues, I love the razor.  </li>
            <li> Other trimmers work better for that.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like brand new!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying a whole new unit.  </li>
            <li> I stopped being able to take it on trips after about a year &amp; a half.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Unit still works just fine for shaving but battery is pretty much dead.  </li>
            <li> The box had a very faded picture on it but who cares about the old box it just gets recycled.</li>
            <li> But I do have to oil it much more often (almost every time I use it) and have it sharpened every few months instead of once a year.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is good but not great.  </li>
            <li> The unit is fresh, seems like new and definitely runs like my ol&#x27; faithful</li>
            <li> so when I was looking to see if they had a new model out there</li>
            <li> The batteries cost almost as much as a new timmer</li>
            <li> than that it comes as promised factory refurbished as new.</li>
            <li> However, it was advertised as new but when I received it it was described as refurbished.  </li>
            <li> The refurb looks and acts like a new one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying a new Norelco Turbo-Vac instead.</li>
            <li> so this purchase was a re-manufactured one and it came fully charged and looked new.</li>
            <li> To my surprise it looks and works as well as a new one</li>
            <li> I wore it out and had to buy a new one ...</li>
            <li> It just makes the MB-70 bulkier and less easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> I may try and take the batteries from this new one and put them in the old one.</li>
            <li> The only positive thing about this product is that it came on time</li>
            <li> So far this product has served it&#x27;s purpose, and I have zero complaints.</li>
            <li> Old trimmer wore out, beard didn&#x27;t, tried a couple of others and then found this.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much to choose from if you want a vacuum trimmer so beggers can&#x27;t be choosers.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum really helps a lot.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s is no mess at all</li>
            <li> He tried several others that didn&#x27;t do as fine a job, and made a mess in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> This new one will probably last for years, but I hope there&#x27;s another one -</li>
            <li> I finally found the new one , works as&lt;br /&gt;well</li>
            <li> I hope the new one lasts as long as the old one did.</li>
            <li> My old locally bought MB-70 way over  5 - 7  years ago</li>
            <li> If you have a full beard and are tired of sweeping up the hair after you use your razor/trimmer, I whole heartedly recommend this unit.  </li>
            <li> This leads me to fear that its life my not as long as a new product.</li>
            <li> Does not hold a charge very long which is why I bought to replace an old Remington mb70</li>
            <li> I have a pretty dense beard and it gets really messy to trim it with the regular trimmer.</li>
            <li> but I ended up having to do just as much clean up around the sink - less volume but still just as messy.</li>
            <li> Even though this trimmer can not pick up 100% of the cut hair, the difference between a regular trimmer and this trimmer with the vacuum is really big.</li>
            <li> , the vacuum is a gimmick, don&#x27;t buy this version</li>
            <li> - the vacuum just doesn&#x27;t work as it should.</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t have a vacuum version for sale unless u buy a re-manufactured one.</li>
            <li> When the battery started failing to hold a charge I went looking for another vacuum trimmer.</li>
            <li> I LIKE THIS REMINGTON MB-70 VACUUM</li>
            <li> AND I ALSO LIKE THE VACUUM</li>
            <li> Holds a charge very long and keeps the wife off my back by having the hairs cleaned up.  </li>
            <li> I like the Remington because it has a single guard with multiple settings.  </li>
            <li> I had the version without the vacuum, much better cutting, this is too bulky</li>
            <li> just the battery wasn&#x27;t holding its charge as long and I broke a piece off the guard</li>
            <li> Long charge time, relatively short run-time, and lack of the option to use corded, mean this shaver can (and in my case did) let you down when you really need it.</li>
            <li> My only two reservations are that you have to use the razor very carefully.  </li>
            <li> So much easier to use for short hair and beards than the standard noisy clippers with the awkward interchangeable guides.</li>
            <li> Have been using this particular Remington model for approximately 4-5 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll it seems the vacuum sucks up alot of the motor&#x27;s power and</li>
            <li> Extremely efficient transaction and quality merchandise!</li>
            <li> I hoping it last me at least another 5-10 years!</li>
            <li> waste your money and time</li>
            <li> In any case, since the MB-70 was no longer being made I was initially forced to look for some other beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> I think I paid $19.00 (thatincludes a couple small combs etc.).    </li>
            <li> The size is inconvenient and just doesn&#x27;t work as well overall.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
            <li> The unit continued to work, but the guide was bent and was very hard to use.  </li>
            <li> the cutting action on this trimmer is pathetic.  </li>
            <li> Also, parts are impossible to get.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer to replace an MB-30 that the batteries went bad on.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed when I discovered that Remington had discontinued this model.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed if buy this trimmer.</li>
            <li> No oiling the clippers either - hate doing that.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product - easy to use for do-it-yourself buzz cuts, and it keeps all the trimmed hair contained.&lt;br /&gt;I believe, however, that it&#x27;s no longer in production. That&#x27;s a shame.</li>
            <li> So far this product has served it&#x27;s purpose, and I have zero complaints. For what it&#x27;s worth you won&#x27;t be upset with your purchase.</li>
            <li> I had purchased one of these about 10 years ago when they first came out. And It still works good today just the battery wasn&#x27;t holding its charge as long and I broke a piece off the guard so when I was looking to see if they had a new model out there I really couldn&#x27;t fine one with the vacuum so I bought the refurbished and it works great! It&#x27;s like brand new! I hoping it last me at least another 5-10 years! Great buy and good price!</li>
            <li> Looked for this beard trimmer forever in stores after the first one kind of burned out and would not hold a charge. I was distraught as this is the best one ive ever used and makes cleanup much easier than most. The factory refurb works just as good as the original and holds a charge for much longer. Longevity is tbd, but happy I found a suitable replacement!</li>
            <li> I got this trimmer to replace another MB-70 I purchased years ago.  The unit is fresh, seems like new and definitely runs like my ol&#x27; faithful did years ago.  Works great and happy with the unit.</li>
            <li> I was worried about buying this.  I never saw a trimmer with a vacum.  Works excellent.  Holds a charge very long and keeps the wife off my back by having the hairs cleaned up.  Catches 90%.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I had the version without the vacuum, much better cutting, this is too bulky, the vacuum is a gimmick, don&#x27;t buy this version</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my old worn out one and this new one works great. The motor on it is much stronger.</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer to replace an MB-30 that the batteries went bad on. The batteries cost almost as much as a new timmer so I thought this was the ticket.  We&#x27;ll it seems the vacuum sucks up alot of the motor&#x27;s power and the cutting action on this trimmer is pathetic.  It really bogs done when it hits some whiskers and that winds up pulling your beard and it&#x27;s not too comfortable.   The MB-30 worked alot better. I may try and take the batteries from this new one and put them in the old one.</li>
            <li> My husband had this for two years.  I thought I&#x27;d clean it for him,and I broke it.  He tried several others that didn&#x27;t do as fine a job, and made a mess in the bathroom. Bought another. Is an Excellent choice for price, performance, and service.</li>
            <li> No wonder Remington discontinued this product - the vacuum just doesn&#x27;t work as it should. It just makes the MB-70 bulkier and less easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it comes as promised factory refurbished as new.</li>
            <li> The Remington beard and mustache trimmer works OK.  However, it was advertised as new but when I received it it was described as refurbished.  This leads me to fear that its life my not as long as a new product.</li>
            <li> These are great trimmers. Bought 2 to make sue I have a spare if they quit selling them. Dropped and broke last one.  So much easier to use for short hair and beards than the standard noisy clippers with the awkward interchangeable guides. Just rotate a button on these.  They last forever too. No oiling the clippers either - hate doing that.</li>
            <li> Had one of these for years and beard for 35 yrs. Old trimmer wore out, beard didn&#x27;t, tried a couple of others and then found this. Re-furbished or not it is the greatest of trimmers. No pulling hair, no newspaper in sink to catch hairs, length of cut control is great. I&#x27;m 80 and hope this one out lives me. I highly recommend this product as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> The only positive thing about this product is that it came on time but it doesn&#x27;t work at all , they send me replacement it works but it doesn&#x27;t shave , it hurts because it pulls the hair and it stings .&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money and time</li>
            <li> I like the Remington because it has a single guard with multiple settings.  It also has a very nice vacuum ability that keeps you from making a mess of the bathroom when you trim your beard.  Few parts to loose and does a great job, and surprisingly inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Although refurbished (Remington doesn&#x27;t make this model anymore) this is the best trimmer I have ever used...I have had my close cropped beard (#2 of 10 settings)for 30+ years and, due to a great vacuum system that you clean (dump out from the bottom) once a week, there&#x27;s is no mess at all...I think I paid $19.00 (thatincludes a couple small combs etc.).    I had my 1st one for about 8-9 years and the battery would no longer take a charge...don&#x27;t bother replacing it...and it&#x27;s not meant to be replaced...but, Hey, 2 trimmers over 17-18 years...don&#x27;t know where you find that kind of longevity for anything anymore...My advice...You&#x27;ll love it and so will the person whose turn it is to clean the bathroom!</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer is an awesome product.  I purchased one several years ago, and after extensive use it just wore out.  I think the problem was that the battery outlived it&#x27;s life cycle and the unit wouldn&#x27;t charge anymore.  I was really disappointed when I discovered that Remington had discontinued this model.  None of the replacement models looked very good to me, so I was extremely happy to find these reburbished ones on Amazon.  I bought the only two available to be sure I&#x27;d have a working trimmer for years to come.  You can pay a lot more money, but you won&#x27;t find a better, easier to use beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> I bought this item to replace the one I&#x27;d bought ten or more years ago and had worn out.   It is an excellent product. Works well, is reliable, and easy to maintain.  All that said I do not understand why Remington has stopped making it. Perhaps it was too good a product. In any case, since the MB-70 was no longer being made I was initially forced to look for some other beard trimmer. I was not able to find anything, at any price, that appeared to be as good as the MB-70. So with some skepticism I bought this refurb. I have been thrilled with the purchase. The refurb looks and acts like a new one. My thanks to the anonymous rebuilder for a job well done.    Now my only problem is what to do with the worn out one. I was hoping someone would let me know where to send it so it could be refurbished too.</li>
            <li> I have bought tons of favourite trimmers. But this is my favourite one. It lasts forever and does everything you want a trimmer to do. The feel and look are also amazing, which is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> this is the third one i have purchased in the last 20+ years. they work great</li>
            <li> This trimmer is good but not great.  It cuts your hair and has a good guard but the vacuum leaves a little to be desired (still alot of hair in and around the sink when I&#x27;m done) and it&#x27;s pretty bulky.  There isn&#x27;t much to choose from if you want a vacuum trimmer so beggers can&#x27;t be choosers.  I guess this is the lesser of all evils.</li>
            <li> Nice product, as advertised, delivered as promised</li>
            <li> Does not hold a charge very long which is why I bought to replace an old Remington mb70</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a similar one for years.  I finally wore it out.  The new one works great and is a joy to use when trimming my beard.  This new one will probably last for years, but I hope there&#x27;s another one - just like it - when I need it.</li>
            <li> I wish they still manufactured this. It is a great product.</li>
            <li> My old locally bought MB-70 way over  5 - 7  years ago battery would not hold a charge and I really loved the MB-70. Glad I found this on Amazon.com and it looks brand new. Fast shipping. Happy Beard Trimmer user again and shame they quit making this model.</li>
            <li> If you have a full beard and are tired of sweeping up the hair after you use your razor/trimmer, I whole heartedly recommend this unit.  It does a very good job of trimming and picks up about 95%+ of the trimmed hairs. Remington also uses a good rechargeable battery, it keeps a charge for quite a while (certainly long enough for a 5-7 day business trip). My only two reservations are that you have to use the razor very carefully.  The guide is a VERY flexible/flimsy and if you&#x27;re not careful you can easily put a whole or two in your beard/mustache. Also, parts are impossible to get.  If you damage the guide, or ANY part, that&#x27;s it.  I dropped my 1st one after two years.  The unit continued to work, but the guide was bent and was very hard to use.  I tried multiple places (even Remington) to get a replacement and could not find one.  I ended up buying a whole new unit.  Other than these two issues, I love the razor.  Have been using this particular Remington model for approximately 4-5 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/28/12 update:  Unit still works just fine for shaving but battery is pretty much dead.  I stopped being able to take it on trips after about a year &amp; a half.  I just leave it plugged in and use it with cord attached.  The unit still works just fine on my beard.  But I do have to oil it much more often (almost every time I use it) and have it sharpened every few months instead of once a year.  Still a good buy if you can find it under 20-25 bucks.  &amp; fyi, vacuums for beard trimmers seem to be going-or already gone-out of style so if you like this type you may want to go ahead and pick up an extra one now.</li>
            <li> I was really glad to be able to find this product.&lt;br /&gt;i had another one that broke and thought I could not find another one</li>
            <li> Extremely efficient transaction and quality merchandise!</li>
            <li> In 2011, who makes a rechargeable shaver with a Ni-Cad battery? It&#x27;s ridiculous. Long charge time, relatively short run-time, and lack of the option to use corded, mean this shaver can (and in my case did) let you down when you really need it. I use this to shave my face and head, a bit of stubble is my norm. Traveled to my wedding in another state, the shaver switched on and discharged in my luggage. Left it to charge for a couple of hours, it ran for about two minutes. Had to go to CVS and buy a corded Conair model in order not to show up to my rehearsal dinner with a hatchet half-shave job. Stress I did not need. I&#x27;m buying a new Norelco Turbo-Vac instead. My old one is vastly superior to this Remington junk. Cheap junk.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Terrific for trimming beard and mustache. Not so much for shaving your head.&lt;br /&gt;Great battery life and shaped just right for the job. Charges fast and holds that charge for a good long time.&lt;br /&gt;Just do not try to shave your head with it or you will regret it. Other trimmers work better for that.&lt;br /&gt;This is the one for head shavers: http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H2B4H5Y/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
            <li> This is my third one but they don&#x27;t make this model anymore and they don&#x27;t have a vacuum version for sale unless u buy a re-manufactured one. so this purchase was a re-manufactured one and it came fully charged and looked new. The box had a very faded picture on it but who cares about the old box it just gets recycled.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful and wasn&#x27;t sold in the store anymore. Finding it online was great and just like the one we had to replace.</li>
            <li> I replaced my old vacuuming trimmer with this one, so far I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> My husband has loved this product and I can&#x27;t  believe that Remington no longer provides this product. Thank you so much for access to this wonderful one of a kind product.</li>
            <li> Quality not as good as my old one, but use it every week for a short goatee and works great</li>
            <li> The head is a bigger then our last one.  But, overall it is ok .</li>
            <li> I have owned this product for a number years and Remington does not make it any more. I had to have another one. Works great and is pretty quiet. I hope the new one lasts as long as the old one did.</li>
            <li> Great! Love that it vacuums!</li>
            <li> The comb guard is cheap and flimsy. It vacuums some hair but I ended up having to do just as much clean up around the sink - less volume but still just as messy. I bought this hoping it would be very similar to the MB-300 that I&#x27;ve had for about a decade but it doesn&#x27;t compare. The size is inconvenient and just doesn&#x27;t work as well overall.</li>
            <li> Originally I bought it years and years ago and I loved it. But then battery died and I found that it is not that easy to replace the battery and that they do not produce them anymore. but I found this one that is refurbished. I did not have much of a choice and purchased one. To my surprise it looks and works as well as a new one and I really like it. The vacuum really helps a lot. It picks up most of the cut hair,and that&#x27;s what I like the most. I have a pretty dense beard and it gets really messy to trim it with the regular trimmer. Even though this trimmer can not pick up 100% of the cut hair, the difference between a regular trimmer and this trimmer with the vacuum is really big. This is why I&#x27;m giving this trimmer 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Had this model trimmer for years and finally it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge. Finally found it on your site and ordered it. It really does a great job. Would recommend to everyone that has a need for a great trimmer.</li>
            <li> I used to have a similar Norelco product. This trimmer works faster and the vacuum unit works flawlessly. Great product!</li>
            <li> So far so good. Think I overpaid for this product being refurbished.</li>
            <li> I bought my original MB-70 10 or 12 years ago and have received great service all these years. When the battery started failing to hold a charge I went looking for another vacuum trimmer. I was absolutely delighted to find factory reconditioned MB-70&#x27;s available and at a great price to boot. I couldn&#x27;t be happier this this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I LIKE THIS REMINGTON MB-70 VACUUM SO FOR IT IS DOING A GOOD JOB ON MAY HEAD...AND I ALSO LIKE THE VACUUM AS&lt;br /&gt;I DON&#x27;T GET HAIR ALL OVER ME...AND I PURCHASED AT AMAZON...</li>
            <li> great trimmer.  bought this one to replace one that wore out!</li>
            <li> Had one of the trimmers and used it so much I wore it out and had to buy a new one ...I finally found the new one , works as&lt;br /&gt;well as the first one did.!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed if buy this trimmer. I use mine 2 times a week. Rechargable and you can use it with the charging cord incase you forget to recharge it. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> So glad that we were able to find a replacement for the one my husband had for 8-10 years. Works great. Don&#x27;t know why Remington quit making them.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this to trim his facial hair.  I love it because I don&#x27;t have to clean hair out of the sink anymore.  An ingenious idea.  I bought it for him for Christmas (more of a present for myself, I guess.  lol) &amp; it&#x27;s still running strong 9 months later.  Very happy with it.</li>
