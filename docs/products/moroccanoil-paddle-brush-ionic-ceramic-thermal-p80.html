            <li>I love it and</li>
            <li>It looks and feels healthy without the use of any product.  </li>

            <li>LOVE this brush.</li>
            <li>i love my mason pearson brushes but even their biggest brushes</li>
            <li>in fact, i think this one even hurts a tad more when trying to get the tangles out.</li>
            <li>Love this brush.</li>
            <li>I hope that I don&#x27;t lose this brush because I tend to lose brushes and I love the way this brush feels when brushing my hair.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this brush.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light weight with a pic!</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>I love all Morrocan products, so I bought this paddle</li>
            <li>I love all the moroccan oil products</li>
            <li>I love Morocacanoil tools and products.</li>
            <li>This is a nice brush, nothing really special though.  </li>
            <li>For $20 bucks your money is best spent elsewhere..</li>
            <li>Fast shipment and good quality.</li>
            <li>It is easy on tangled hair.</li>
            <li>I suggest family wish children at the house to buy it, it will make there life easy.</li>
            <li>This is by far my most favorite brush I own.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair but its fine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li>Work the very first time!</li>
            <li>It is great for my long, fine hair.</li>
            <li>My hair rarely breaks when I use it, and the pins are super sturdy!</li>
            <li>Nothing special about this brush.</li>
            <li>I have one old paddle brush that I have had for so many years</li>
            <li>The shampoo wash fixed the static problem.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a fine brush but nothing special that i can figure out so far.</li>
            <li>It helps part my hair quickly, doesn&#x27;t get lost, and I also use it to help clean the hair from my brush regularly and easily.</li>
            <li>Great Brush but only for a short period of time..</li>
            <li>any of their products found outside of a licensed salon can NOT be guaranteed as authentic.  </li>
            <li>For the price, I have to say I have found better or equal brushes at Ulta and Bed Bath Beyond.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical about buying this brush since it&#x27;s a lot for one, but it&#x27;s really wonderful.</li>
            <li>Overall, an ok brush.  </li>
            <li>I get very frizzy hair!</li>
            <li>Works great for my long, think, curly, blonde hair that I like to straighten.</li>
            <li>I just got another last week and love it....</li>
            <li>I lost it all during cancer treatment and don&#x27;t want anything ruining my fresh new &#x27;virgin&#x27; hair.  </li>
            <li>I like it, Super soft for my damaged hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>and it is a much quicker way of getting my hair straight and looks beautiful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but after a week or so the bristles started coming out sporadically, and eventually the whole thing would come apart.  </li>
            <li>so much-</li>
            <li>I have long, fine, wavy/frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it turned my hair into a static mess though!</li>
            <li>After trying this and using Wen, my hair is soft, manageable, and very shiny!  </li>
            <li>It does reduce some of my frizz more than an average paddle brush</li>
            <li>This hairbrush is great for my thick coarse hair.</li>
            <li>Definitely a high quality product and holds up like one.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>but so far i really don&#x27;t see any difference in this brush than a Goody&#x27;s that i got at the drug store for probably under $10.</li>
            <li>I thought I would like it better than the round brush.  </li>
            <li>My sister bought this brush for my 5 year old daughter who has long, thick, beautiful hair.  </li>
            <li>Larger than I expected but really does a super job on my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>I wanted boar&#x27;s hair or something natural</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to use the flat iron so much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so many different products to keep the frizz away and different brushes that its ridiculous how much money I kept spending on the hair.</li>
            <li>theese are great products, but the prices are not better on the internet so support local small business owners ans stop outside sales of salon products.</li>
            <li>First off let me say that I&#x27;m very careful when it comes to my hair.  </li>
            <li>it really does help my hair blow dry faster too!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s so much better than using a round brush that takes so much longer with my thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this especially for people with lots of long hair!</li>
            <li>it barely has bristles left.  </li>

            <li> it barely has bristles left.  </li>
            <li> I have really long, super thick hair</li>
            <li> Just go buy a regular flat brush with a rubber surface</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not natural like I wanted</li>
            <li> I have really long curly hair and straighten it quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I have very long curly hair.</li>
            <li> I use it to dry my hair,  </li>
            <li> It did not make my wavy/somewhat unruly hair any less frizzy than a regular square paddle brush does.</li>
            <li> but i would like to point out that Moroccan Oil, as a company, seriously tries to cut out diversion.  </li>
            <li> This brush is just what I expected.  </li>
            <li> when I&#x27;m brushing my hair, I can even use the brush when my hair is wet and it doesn&#x27;t break my hair.</li>
            <li> one for a gift, the other for myself.  </li>
            <li> I saw some other reviews taking about this.</li>
            <li> My little ones love it too, the only complaint is that is a little bit expensive, but you pay for what you get!</li>
            <li> Also, it never snags, does seem to slightly decrease by blow dry time, and has the little hair parter that stays in the end of the hair brush.</li>
            <li> are a little too soft to really get out the tangles out when they get bad since i have very long, thick and wavy hair.</li>
            <li> but it broke it half.  </li>
            <li> I have long thick hair</li>
            <li> my daughter has long thick hair....</li>
            <li> This is one of a few brushes that will go all the way through my thick long hair and massages my scalp in the process.</li>
            <li> I washed it with a little  </li>
            <li> It has a little tail comb on the end to help do you hair and not have a ton of tools laying around.</li>
            <li> and I still like the round brush.</li>
            <li> and it just snapped in half!</li>
            <li> The little nubs at the end of each bristles have all stayed on!</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> I had to toss it after a few months unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Goes through thick hair like a champ!</li>
            <li> but this is just not a great brush.</li>
            <li> After my toddler destroyed it, I was bummed because I can&#x27;t afford another expensive brush.</li>
            <li> WTF!</li>
            <li> My hair is very difficult to deal with and this brush doesn&#x27;t break my hair like some do</li>

            <li> The best brush I&#x27;ve ever used to blowdry my hair.</li>
            <li> Got this as a Christmas stocking gift for my Wife - her hair has never looked better and she seems to love it.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush for straight hair.  I use it to dry my hair,  so I don&#x27;t have to use the flat iron so much.</li>
            <li> I like it, Super soft for my damaged hair. My little ones love it too, the only complaint is that is a little bit expensive, but you pay for what you get!</li>
            <li> Can also, but there is electrostatic don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment and good quality. Love it~</li>
            <li> I noticed that my hairdresser has the nicest brush when she cuts and styles my hair.  After inquiring about the brush, my hairdresser told me it was a Moroccan Oil Hair Brush and that she orders hers off the internet. Of course, I knew Amazon would have this item. I ordered two around Christmas time...  one for a gift, the other for myself.  I love the way my hair looks when it is styled using this brush.  Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> This brush was really really excellent at detangling and I loved that the ornage thing came with it to clean it out. 5 stars for effectiveness.However I&#x27;ve only had mine a couple months and it just snapped in half! Likely not the fault of the brush- I have very long curly hair.However the walmart hair burshes lasted longer so I think 2 stars for durability.</li>
            <li> My sister bought this brush for my 5 year old daughter who has long, thick, beautiful hair.  Nothing gets through the tangles without tears like this brush.  We call it the MAGIC brush! :-)</li>
            <li> Love Moroccan Oil products. Glad I could buy them from Amazon! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> These are the best brushes ever! but i would like to point out that Moroccan Oil, as a company, seriously tries to cut out diversion.  any of their products found outside of a licensed salon can NOT be guaranteed as authentic.  Moroccan Oil ONLY sells to salons through regional distributors.  theese are great products, but the prices are not better on the internet so support local small business owners ans stop outside sales of salon products.</li>
            <li> Beautiful large brush, expertly packed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after going through several brushes.  I wanted boar&#x27;s hair or something natural but my hair broke every brush.  Seriously.  I have one old paddle brush that I have had for so many years it barely has bristles left.  I have a lot of hair but its fine.  My hair is very difficult to deal with and this brush doesn&#x27;t break my hair like some do and it gets the job done.  It&#x27;s not natural like I wanted but it holds up to my hair so kudoes to Moroccanoil.  I like the brush.</li>
            <li> This hairbrush is great for my thick coarse hair. It smooths my hair out and  detangles. Best brush I ever had.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I have thick hair and I&#x27;m tender headed, so this is the perfect brush for me.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I have long, fine, wavy/frizzy hair. This brush is great. The little nubs at the end of each bristles have all stayed on! Also, it never snags, does seem to slightly decrease by blow dry time, and has the little hair parter that stays in the end of the hair brush. Its great. It helps part my hair quickly, doesn&#x27;t get lost, and I also use it to help clean the hair from my brush regularly and easily. Definitely a high quality product and holds up like one.</li>
            <li> I use this brush along with the hair oil and it is a much quicker way of getting my hair straight and looks beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so much better than using a round brush that takes so much longer with my thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> This brush is cheaper than at my local hair salon and the same product. I bought it for a friend for her birthday after owning my own.</li>
            <li> For the price, I have to say I have found better or equal brushes at Ulta and Bed Bath Beyond.  I went with all the buzz.  I have long thick hair but this is just not a great brush.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE PRODUCT AND WILL CONTINUE TO BUY MORE  OF IT.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this brush. Just go buy a regular flat brush with a rubber surface and you will get the same result. It did not make my wavy/somewhat unruly hair any less frizzy than a regular square paddle brush does.</li>
            <li> This brush is just what I expected.  I thought I would like it better than the round brush.  I bought it, I tried it and I still like the round brush.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable handle</li>
            <li> Great brush. It is easy on tangled hair.</li>
            <li> Great brush! Very light. Goes through thick hair like a champ!</li>
            <li> good product! makes  my hair shinny!</li>
            <li> it is big but i love it</li>
            <li> Love it! Detangles and beautifies! Work the very first time!</li>
            <li> Wonderful!  Daughter loves it!</li>
            <li> This is the best brush we have ever used.  It feels good to use and does an amazing job on your hair!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brush! I love it and my hair never tangles.</li>
            <li> First off let me say that I&#x27;m very careful when it comes to my hair.  I lost it all during cancer treatment and don&#x27;t want anything ruining my fresh new &#x27;virgin&#x27; hair.  But flyaways kept me running to anti frizz products.  After trying this and using Wen, my hair is soft, manageable, and very shiny!  It looks and feels healthy without the use of any product.  I even let my girlfriend use it while we were on vacation and her frizziness was gone!  I don&#x27;t know why, but it works for me!!</li>
            <li> Ah-MAZING. I have really long, super thick hair and it is the most painless brush I&#x27;ve ever used. THANK YOU MORONCCAINOIL</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying this brush since it&#x27;s a lot for one, but it&#x27;s really wonderful. My hair rarely breaks when I use it, and the pins are super sturdy! My favorite brush ever!</li>
            <li> This is a magic brush! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a nice brush, nothing really special though.  It does reduce some of my frizz more than an average paddle brush but I wish the entire paddle was ceramic not just the edges.  Overall, an ok brush.  RDA @ [...]</li>
            <li> I suggest family wish children at the house to buy it, it will make there life easy. No strolling all the way</li>
            <li> I love this brush and how it makes my hair feel.  It brushes with a minimum of pulling and snarls.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine but it could be better</li>
            <li> Finally my daughter likes to comb her hair.</li>
            <li> I had a $70 brush I bought at an Aveda store several years ago. After my toddler destroyed it, I was bummed because I can&#x27;t afford another expensive brush. After some searching, I found this one. I have to say, I like it better than my former expensive brush.</li>
            <li> LOVE this brush. I have really long curly hair and straighten it quite a bit. This brush feels amazing against my scalp.</li>
            <li> This brush started out great but after a week or so the bristles started coming out sporadically, and eventually the whole thing would come apart.  I had to toss it after a few months unfortunately.</li>
            <li> The best brush in the world !!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this does not pull hair great for seniors</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a fine brush but nothing special that i can figure out so far. i love my mason pearson brushes but even their biggest brushes are a little too soft to really get out the tangles out when they get bad since i have very long, thick and wavy hair. so this brush has been good for that but so far i really don&#x27;t see any difference in this brush than a Goody&#x27;s that i got at the drug store for probably under $10. in fact, i think this one even hurts a tad more when trying to get the tangles out.</li>
            <li> This is my second Moroccanoil XL Pro Paddle Brush. I love love this brush! I get very frizzy hair! I&#x27;ve used so many different products to keep the frizz away and different brushes that its ridiculous how much money I kept spending on the hair. I Like this brush since I don&#x27;t have to ad any hair oil or leave in-treatment  when I&#x27;m brushing my hair, I can even use the brush when my hair is wet and it doesn&#x27;t break my hair. Just a great great brush!</li>
            <li> Love this brush. Works great for my long, think, curly, blonde hair that I like to straighten. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I like the brush but it broke it half.  For the price it should not break.</li>
            <li> This is by far my most favorite brush I own. I hope that I don&#x27;t lose this brush because I tend to lose brushes and I love the way this brush feels when brushing my hair. This is one of a few brushes that will go all the way through my thick long hair and massages my scalp in the process. Love, love, love this brush.</li>
            <li> A must for any female who hates blow drying her hair..This brush is absolutely amazing I bought one 5 years ago and shared with my teenage daughters I just got another last week and love it....nothing better!&lt;br /&gt;The best part it&#x27;s light weight with a pic!</li>
            <li> I love this brush. The first time I used it turned my hair into a static mess though! I saw some other reviews taking about this. I washed it with a little  shampoo- now its a wonderful brush! The shampoo wash fixed the static problem.  It makes my hair so soft and shiny. it really does help my hair blow dry faster too! I had no idea that a brush can change your hair so much- I&#x27;m done with cheapo target ones forever!</li>
            <li> Great hair brush.  Larger than I expected but really does a super job on my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> It works good,but I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> I love all Morrocan products, so I bought this paddle brush!&lt;br /&gt;I only used once and my hair turns SO FRIZZ!!!!! WTF! I was looking like Tina Turner!!! Ahahahahaha&lt;br /&gt;Well, I will give it another chance, the brand deserve it!</li>
            <li> this is the bet brush ever....my daughter has long thick hair....she said it is the best brush she has ever had....</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing.. makes my hair and my girls hair so smooth!  Great detangler too!</li>
            <li> This is the best hairbrush I&#x27;ve ever had. It makes your hair feel so silky after you brush it! I love all the moroccan oil products</li>
            <li> Great Brush but only for a short period of time.. The whole front pulled out only after a few months... For $20 bucks your money is best spent elsewhere..</li>
            <li> My friend had this brush &amp; short of stealing it from her, I bought one. It is great for my long, fine hair.</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome. It has a little tail comb on the end to help do you hair and not have a ton of tools laying around. I love Morocacanoil tools and products.</li>
            <li> A great brush! Highly recommend this especially for people with lots of long hair!</li>
