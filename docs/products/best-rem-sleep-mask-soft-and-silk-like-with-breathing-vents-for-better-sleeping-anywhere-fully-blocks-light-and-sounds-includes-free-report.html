            <li>It&#x27;s a thicker, quality material, it&#x27;s made great and very durable</li>
            <li>since I have children, I have to be able to hear through the night, but I do use them for when I&#x27;m doing homework, or when I&#x27;m meditating.</li>
            <li>This Valhalla sleep mask is among one of the better I have seen or tested.</li>
            <li>The material is smooth to the skin almost as nice as silk.</li>

            <li>in the market for a sleep mask could use this sleep mask for sure.</li>
            <li>I love the eye mask.</li>
            <li>So I decided to try the Best Rem Sleep Mask by Gateway International and I am glad that I did.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad that I received for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased review.en a life saver for me!</li>
            <li>I found it hilarious because I would have never pictured him wearing a sleep mask.</li>
            <li>I was given this product free to review but regardless all opinions are my own*</li>
            <li>I removed the mask, I was able to fall asleep quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It is quite stylish too and it just works.</li>
            <li>I will buy another this shopping season for friends and family -- just do not tell them... OK?</li>
            <li>I thought this mask was OK.</li>
            <li>And has given me the ability to sleep better at nights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>studies about sleep deprivation in America point to how many lights are surrounding us (phones, alarm clocks, etc.)</li>
            <li>I love them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have used it three nights, and I do sleep better.</li>
            <li>The adjustable strap makes it easy to secure it around my head, and the vents are a nice touch as well.</li>
            <li>I found this to be a really nice product, perfect especially for those who travel, since the eyes aren&#x27;t right against the head</li>
            <li>The more I tried to get comfortable, the more the mask shifted and slid around my face and head.</li>
            <li>I have severe insomnia, so I&#x27;m always looking for something that will help me sleep more soundly at night.</li>
            <li>(I received this product complimentary for my review, but my opinions are my own).</li>
            <li>and so it works perfectly when I travel, (on buses, trains, plains, passenger in other vehicles, etc.)</li>
            <li>It is easy to breathe with the material covering your nose</li>
            <li>and whenever I know I won&#x27;t fall asleep easily</li>
            <li>, I place the easy to use sleep mask on my face and voila.</li>
            <li>The product, however, is well-made and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This makes it easy to block the sounds of others in the house.</li>
            <li>Using it is easy too.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this sleep mask and ear plugs for a good nights rest/</li>
            <li>They are easy to put in and are comfortable.  </li>
            <li>, this is great because when you go into REM sleep your eyes actually move and flutter, and it fully blocks out all light.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic sleep mask.</li>
            <li>These vents are set up in a way that does not allow light into the eye area covered by the mask.</li>
            <li>My eyes are free to blink as needed.</li>
            <li>the stuff that comes with it is nice quality and very usable.</li>
            <li>Light still manages to come through from underneath sometimes...</li>
            <li>I have tried using sleep masks because they block out the light</li>
            <li>received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
            <li>whenever your body feels reenergized, without the interruption of sound or light.</li>
            <li>Serenity Sleep Mask fully blocks light and sound with the included earplugs.</li>
            <li>I received this product free for testing via Tomoson.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t bother my makeup while sleeping on a plane, yet the nose allows the mask to keep any and all light out.</li>
            <li>No longer have to worry about my roommate&#x27;s desk light or anything of the sort.</li>
            <li>It is worth what I paid and more.</li>
            <li>and this mask helps block out light distractions that hinder me from falling asleep.</li>
            <li>It reeks of cheap plastic when you take it out of the bag</li>
            <li>It is fully adjustable, and comfortable.</li>
            <li>all providing too much light.</li>
            <li>Also a pair of ear plugs comes with this sleeping mask ( very useful).</li>
            <li>But all in all I 110% recommend this sleep mask to EVERYONE who wants a good, quality mask at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The sleep mask itself is my favorite part of this whole set!</li>
            <li>It is difficult to say which one is the best of the best, but if we take a look at reviews of different sleep masks and earplugs, we might come close to finding an answer to this question.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Customer service was friendly and offered a refund.</li>
            <li>Blocks out all light which is cool.</li>
            <li>It is made with Velcro but not the cheap, everyday, Velcro but the one which does not make a load of noise when you move, essential when sleep won&#x27;t come easy... making it an even more awesome product.</li>
            <li>It comes with a one year full warranty.</li>
            <li>It comes with a one year full warranty.</li>
            <li>This mask is also adjustable so that it can be adjusted to fit just right.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s great,</li>
            <li>Lucky for me</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I love the cool darkness from this mask, it does not work for very young children.</li>
            <li>The mask itself is very comfortable to wear and actually keeps All of the light out.</li>
            <li>this mask really keeps light out.</li>
            <li>She says the ear plugs do muffle/block most noises, but if it&#x27;s a loud noise, it will not be blocked.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 100% worth the money.</li>
            <li>it comes with ear plugs and a small drawstring bag to store the mask in which would be great to travel with as a bonus.</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that this sleep mask is light weight and is rounded in the front so that it doesn&#x27;t push against your eyes which makes it more comfortable than other sleep masks I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>They eye cups are not of a pre-formed material and can be kind of stretched to help hold it off of the eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is one product, in particular, that has more positive reviews than anything else on several well-known and reputable online sites, where customers are allowed to rate and review their most recent purchases:</li>
            <li>I used this sleep mask during a car trip not only did it do a fantastic job blocking all the light out</li>
            <li>It is thicker then your standard cheap dollar store brand or the cheap ones you get on airplanes.</li>
            <li>It blocks out the light completely and the vents prevent my face from getting overheated.</li>
            <li>The first night I tried this Valhalla Sleep mask</li>
            <li>Of course, you would have to buy both items to have a peaceful sleep and wakeup</li>
            <li>According to its manufacturer, it can last for many years.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this mask, ever since I had my second child I haven&#x27;t been sleeping.</li>
            <li>With your first they say &amp;#34;sleep</li>
            <li>This mask has completely blocked out all light, even in the daylight hours.</li>
            <li>I bought this one because it was hand-washable - had no latex - is Hypoallergenic - and I could be sure it would fit not just me but my wife if it came down to that because one size fits all.</li>
            <li>A little smelly when it first comes out of it&#x27;s packaging as it must have a plastic mould under the soft exterior but once aired it does a great job shutting out the light</li>
            <li>so you can quickly and easily get the straps to fit securely round your head.  </li>
            <li>They only muffle sound barely, I was able to hear ever word being said to me while having in the ear plugs and without anyone having to change their tone or level of their voices.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>OH, something else I really liked that you can&#x27;t see in the picture is there is a soft black piece of material that goes across the bridge of the nose to help block out the light, but doesn&#x27;t hurt against the nose.</li>
            <li>it was so nice to keep the pesky sun from ruining my sleep after the time change I have been getting woken up over an hour earlier it was getting old.</li>
            <li>so haven&#x27;t used them (more likely to put them in to drown out the sound of &#x27;Gems TV&#x27; or something similar when my wife puts it</li>
            <li>I sleep right by the bathroom, in which I leave the light on because I have a little one who needs to see light in the hall.</li>
            <li>Other than that, the Serenity Sleep Mask is a fantastic product that really does live up to the hype that surrounds it; therefore, we highly recommend it.for many years.</li>
            <li>I really love the air vents on the side of the mask, because my face doesn&#x27;t get all hot and sweaty during the night like it has with other masks.</li>
            <li>When the rooster sings at 6 a.m. and then soon after the bright morning sunrays bombard your face while you are in your sleep--can definitely be a very upsetting situation to say the least.</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this mask!</li>
            <li>anyone would like to know there are some real differences in sleep masks.</li>
            <li>This mask is very well consturcted.</li>
            <li>This really helps to keep the mask in place.</li>
            <li>This sleep mask is really a quality product.</li>
            <li>This Valhalla Sleep mask also has an adjustable elastic strap in the back so that you can adjust it to fit your head</li>
            <li>Very helpful for sleeping.</li>
            <li>The plastic of the side vents and the seams on the sides bore into my head, not allowing me to get comfortable enough to even TRY to fall asleep.</li>
            <li>It definitely keeps the light out and drowns out the noise.</li>
            <li>caught our eye about this product, besides its innumerable positive reviews, is that it comes along with high-quality earplugs and that it&#x27;s being offered at a super very low price.</li>
            <li>its&#x27; main purpose, and when I fall asleep in my bed.</li>
            <li>It is the only one I have found that completely blocks all light.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend getting this Sleep mask.</li>
            <li>Valhalla Sleep Mask is an extremely high quality eye mask.</li>
            <li>but I like the soft, silky feeling of other sleeping masks better.</li>
            <li>It does take a little bit of time to get used to for sure.</li>
            <li>I love the little bag that you can put them in once you wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li>First of all it does keep all the light out and the ear plugs are made of high quality so that you don&#x27;t hear every little noise around you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than that, the Serenity Sleep Mask is a fantastic product that really does live up to the hype that surrounds it; therefore, we highly recommend it.</li>

            <li>I originally bought this for my 5 year old son for travel, as he needed the air vents to reduce eczema from dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The piece of cloth is very soft and almost rubber bandish type material.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>I looked at what similar items were offering before choosing to purchase this one and I am glad I did; because this was my first such product, I did not want any regrets.</li>
            <li>I like things pitch black, but there is always a light on somewhere.  </li>
            <li>so i pull it as far down as comfortable.</li>
            <li>I have a hard time falling asleep most nights</li>
            <li>There is also a soft cloth that goes over the end of the nose.</li>
            <li>mask itself is soft and designed with dual vent holes</li>
            <li>Both items are constructed of advanced materials that provide a heavy duty construction that is feather-light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Both items are constructed of advanced materials that provide a heavy duty construction that is feather-light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product is soft and well made.</li>
            <li>This mask is made so that it does not sit directly on your eyes so it won&#x27;t crush your eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Being my first sleep mask, I soon learned the inevitable -- falling on my back is a must</li>
            <li>But this extra material is what makes this mask so different than others because this is the key to blocking out the light and is why you have 100% total darkness when wearing this sleep mask.  </li>
            <li>While using this sleep mask, no light seeps through and I no longer wake up in the middle of the night wishing I could just turn the darn light off,</li>
            <li>So if you are the type of individual who doesn’t like very soft material on your face, then this product may not be suited for you.</li>
            <li>So if you are the type of individual who doesn’t like very soft material on your face, then this product may not be suited for you.</li>
            <li>I suffer from migraines at least 1 to 2 a week and light sensitivity is one of my biggest symptoms.</li>
            <li>There are vents on the sides of the mask to keep air circulating so your eyes will not dry out.</li>
            <li>so it will not dry your skin and</li>
            <li>It really cuts down on this travel motion.</li>
            <li>It is quite shocking how a manufacturer can provide a top-notch sleep mask and earplugs at such a ‘wow’ low price.</li>
            <li>so he was having a tough time sleeping because of the light.</li>

            <li> This mask also came with earplugs and nice bag to put the mask and earplugs in for easy travel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thicker, quality material, it&#x27;s made great and very durable</li>
            <li> since I have children, I have to be able to hear through the night, but I do use them for when I&#x27;m doing homework, or when I&#x27;m meditating.</li>
            <li> This Valhalla sleep mask is among one of the better I have seen or tested.</li>
            <li> The material is smooth to the skin almost as nice as silk.</li>
            <li> I comes with to vents, one on each side of the mask that allows the eyes to be able to breath all night.</li>
            <li> in the market for a sleep mask could use this sleep mask for sure.</li>
            <li> I love the eye mask.</li>
            <li> So I decided to try the Best Rem Sleep Mask by Gateway International and I am glad that I did.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad that I received for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased review.en a life saver for me!</li>
            <li> I found it hilarious because I would have never pictured him wearing a sleep mask.</li>
            <li> I was given this product free to review but regardless all opinions are my own*</li>
            <li> I removed the mask, I was able to fall asleep quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It is quite stylish too and it just works.</li>
            <li> I will buy another this shopping season for friends and family -- just do not tell them... OK?</li>
            <li> I thought this mask was OK.</li>
            <li> And has given me the ability to sleep better at nights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> studies about sleep deprivation in America point to how many lights are surrounding us (phones, alarm clocks, etc.)</li>
            <li> I love them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have used it three nights, and I do sleep better.</li>
            <li> The adjustable strap makes it easy to secure it around my head, and the vents are a nice touch as well.</li>
            <li> I found this to be a really nice product, perfect especially for those who travel, since the eyes aren&#x27;t right against the head</li>
            <li> The more I tried to get comfortable, the more the mask shifted and slid around my face and head.</li>
            <li> I have severe insomnia, so I&#x27;m always looking for something that will help me sleep more soundly at night.</li>
            <li> (I received this product complimentary for my review, but my opinions are my own).</li>
            <li> and so it works perfectly when I travel, (on buses, trains, plains, passenger in other vehicles, etc.)</li>
            <li> It is easy to breathe with the material covering your nose</li>
            <li> and whenever I know I won&#x27;t fall asleep easily</li>
            <li> , I place the easy to use sleep mask on my face and voila.</li>
            <li> The product, however, is well-made and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This makes it easy to block the sounds of others in the house.</li>
            <li> Using it is easy too.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this sleep mask and ear plugs for a good nights rest/</li>
            <li> They are easy to put in and are comfortable.  </li>
            <li> , this is great because when you go into REM sleep your eyes actually move and flutter, and it fully blocks out all light.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic sleep mask.</li>
            <li> These vents are set up in a way that does not allow light into the eye area covered by the mask.</li>
            <li> My eyes are free to blink as needed.</li>
            <li> the stuff that comes with it is nice quality and very usable.</li>
            <li> Light still manages to come through from underneath sometimes...</li>
            <li> I have tried using sleep masks because they block out the light</li>
            <li> received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
            <li> whenever your body feels reenergized, without the interruption of sound or light.</li>
            <li> Serenity Sleep Mask fully blocks light and sound with the included earplugs.</li>
            <li> I received this product free for testing via Tomoson.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t bother my makeup while sleeping on a plane, yet the nose allows the mask to keep any and all light out.</li>
            <li> No longer have to worry about my roommate&#x27;s desk light or anything of the sort.</li>
            <li> It is worth what I paid and more.</li>
            <li> and this mask helps block out light distractions that hinder me from falling asleep.</li>
            <li> It reeks of cheap plastic when you take it out of the bag</li>
            <li> It is fully adjustable, and comfortable.</li>
            <li> all providing too much light.</li>
            <li> Also a pair of ear plugs comes with this sleeping mask ( very useful).</li>
            <li> But all in all I 110% recommend this sleep mask to EVERYONE who wants a good, quality mask at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The sleep mask itself is my favorite part of this whole set!</li>
            <li> It is difficult to say which one is the best of the best, but if we take a look at reviews of different sleep masks and earplugs, we might come close to finding an answer to this question.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Customer service was friendly and offered a refund.</li>
            <li> Blocks out all light which is cool.</li>
            <li> It is made with Velcro but not the cheap, everyday, Velcro but the one which does not make a load of noise when you move, essential when sleep won&#x27;t come easy... making it an even more awesome product.</li>
            <li> It comes with a one year full warranty.</li>
            <li> It comes with a one year full warranty.</li>
            <li> This mask is also adjustable so that it can be adjusted to fit just right.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s great,</li>
            <li> Lucky for me</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I love the cool darkness from this mask, it does not work for very young children.</li>
            <li> The mask itself is very comfortable to wear and actually keeps All of the light out.</li>
            <li> this mask really keeps light out.</li>
            <li> She says the ear plugs do muffle/block most noises, but if it&#x27;s a loud noise, it will not be blocked.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 100% worth the money.</li>
            <li> it comes with ear plugs and a small drawstring bag to store the mask in which would be great to travel with as a bonus.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that this sleep mask is light weight and is rounded in the front so that it doesn&#x27;t push against your eyes which makes it more comfortable than other sleep masks I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> They eye cups are not of a pre-formed material and can be kind of stretched to help hold it off of the eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is one product, in particular, that has more positive reviews than anything else on several well-known and reputable online sites, where customers are allowed to rate and review their most recent purchases:</li>
            <li> I used this sleep mask during a car trip not only did it do a fantastic job blocking all the light out</li>
            <li> It is thicker then your standard cheap dollar store brand or the cheap ones you get on airplanes.</li>
            <li> It blocks out the light completely and the vents prevent my face from getting overheated.</li>
            <li> The first night I tried this Valhalla Sleep mask</li>
            <li> Of course, you would have to buy both items to have a peaceful sleep and wakeup</li>
            <li> According to its manufacturer, it can last for many years.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mask, ever since I had my second child I haven&#x27;t been sleeping.</li>
            <li> With your first they say &amp;#34;sleep</li>
            <li> This mask has completely blocked out all light, even in the daylight hours.</li>
            <li> I bought this one because it was hand-washable - had no latex - is Hypoallergenic - and I could be sure it would fit not just me but my wife if it came down to that because one size fits all.</li>
            <li> A little smelly when it first comes out of it&#x27;s packaging as it must have a plastic mould under the soft exterior but once aired it does a great job shutting out the light</li>
            <li> so you can quickly and easily get the straps to fit securely round your head.  </li>
            <li> They only muffle sound barely, I was able to hear ever word being said to me while having in the ear plugs and without anyone having to change their tone or level of their voices.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> OH, something else I really liked that you can&#x27;t see in the picture is there is a soft black piece of material that goes across the bridge of the nose to help block out the light, but doesn&#x27;t hurt against the nose.</li>
            <li> it was so nice to keep the pesky sun from ruining my sleep after the time change I have been getting woken up over an hour earlier it was getting old.</li>
            <li> so haven&#x27;t used them (more likely to put them in to drown out the sound of &#x27;Gems TV&#x27; or something similar when my wife puts it</li>
            <li> I sleep right by the bathroom, in which I leave the light on because I have a little one who needs to see light in the hall.</li>
            <li> Other than that, the Serenity Sleep Mask is a fantastic product that really does live up to the hype that surrounds it; therefore, we highly recommend it.for many years.</li>
            <li> I really love the air vents on the side of the mask, because my face doesn&#x27;t get all hot and sweaty during the night like it has with other masks.</li>
            <li> When the rooster sings at 6 a.m. and then soon after the bright morning sunrays bombard your face while you are in your sleep--can definitely be a very upsetting situation to say the least.</li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this mask!</li>
            <li> anyone would like to know there are some real differences in sleep masks.</li>
            <li> This mask is very well consturcted.</li>
            <li> This really helps to keep the mask in place.</li>
            <li> This sleep mask is really a quality product.</li>
            <li> This Valhalla Sleep mask also has an adjustable elastic strap in the back so that you can adjust it to fit your head</li>
            <li> Very helpful for sleeping.</li>
            <li> The plastic of the side vents and the seams on the sides bore into my head, not allowing me to get comfortable enough to even TRY to fall asleep.</li>
            <li> It definitely keeps the light out and drowns out the noise.</li>
            <li> caught our eye about this product, besides its innumerable positive reviews, is that it comes along with high-quality earplugs and that it&#x27;s being offered at a super very low price.</li>
            <li> its&#x27; main purpose, and when I fall asleep in my bed.</li>
            <li> It is the only one I have found that completely blocks all light.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend getting this Sleep mask.</li>
            <li> Valhalla Sleep Mask is an extremely high quality eye mask.</li>
            <li> but I like the soft, silky feeling of other sleeping masks better.</li>
            <li> It does take a little bit of time to get used to for sure.</li>
            <li> I love the little bag that you can put them in once you wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li> First of all it does keep all the light out and the ear plugs are made of high quality so that you don&#x27;t hear every little noise around you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that, the Serenity Sleep Mask is a fantastic product that really does live up to the hype that surrounds it; therefore, we highly recommend it.</li>

            <li> I originally bought this for my 5 year old son for travel, as he needed the air vents to reduce eczema from dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The piece of cloth is very soft and almost rubber bandish type material.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> I looked at what similar items were offering before choosing to purchase this one and I am glad I did; because this was my first such product, I did not want any regrets.</li>
            <li> I like things pitch black, but there is always a light on somewhere.  </li>
            <li> so i pull it as far down as comfortable.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time falling asleep most nights</li>
            <li> There is also a soft cloth that goes over the end of the nose.</li>
            <li> mask itself is soft and designed with dual vent holes</li>
            <li> Both items are constructed of advanced materials that provide a heavy duty construction that is feather-light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Both items are constructed of advanced materials that provide a heavy duty construction that is feather-light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product is soft and well made.</li>
            <li> This mask is made so that it does not sit directly on your eyes so it won&#x27;t crush your eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Being my first sleep mask, I soon learned the inevitable -- falling on my back is a must</li>
            <li> But this extra material is what makes this mask so different than others because this is the key to blocking out the light and is why you have 100% total darkness when wearing this sleep mask.  </li>
            <li> While using this sleep mask, no light seeps through and I no longer wake up in the middle of the night wishing I could just turn the darn light off,</li>
            <li> So if you are the type of individual who doesn’t like very soft material on your face, then this product may not be suited for you.</li>
            <li> So if you are the type of individual who doesn’t like very soft material on your face, then this product may not be suited for you.</li>
            <li> I suffer from migraines at least 1 to 2 a week and light sensitivity is one of my biggest symptoms.</li>
            <li> There are vents on the sides of the mask to keep air circulating so your eyes will not dry out.</li>
            <li> so it will not dry your skin and</li>
            <li> It really cuts down on this travel motion.</li>
            <li> It is quite shocking how a manufacturer can provide a top-notch sleep mask and earplugs at such a ‘wow’ low price.</li>
            <li> so he was having a tough time sleeping because of the light.</li>
            <li> As someone who prefers to sleep in complete and total darkness, I was excited to try it, but worried it would be uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> But it has a strong industrial chemical odor, and my poor dry eyes aren&#x27;t feeling any benefit yet.</li>
            <li> I tend to stay awake because I have very sensitive hearing so any little noise will wake me up, then I can&#x27;t fall back to sleep.</li>
            <li> When your sleep is interrupted, you are not able to function throughout the day as you normally would if you would&#x27;ve gotten an uninterrupted sleep.</li>
            <li> So,it is real hard to get a full night&#x27;s rest.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for $1 as part of a promotion but then spent another $35 shipping it back to the UK.  </li>
            <li> and then they get stretched out or start to unravel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would suggest trying this instead of sleeping pills - it may work for you instead, and will be a lot cheaper, and healthier in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Only down side is it falls off in the middle of the night, so I have to go searching for it in the morning.</li>
            <li> The sleep mask also has this thin black material that goes over your nose to help keep the light out that sometimes peeks in from the nose cutouts.</li>
            <li> it also has a velcro strap versus the regular elastic straps that typically stretch out and loosen on regular sleep masks.</li>
            <li> I mean real lights out even with ceiling or bedside lamps on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only other thing to comment on is the piece of cloth that goes over the end of the nose.</li>
            <li> It will hold together for a very long while.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m not giving this a 5 star review is the fact of the package was crushed so the mask was crushed in when I got it.</li>
            <li> If you are the type of individuals who often moves a lot in your sleep, you can rest assured that this mask won’t come loose or flatten.</li>

            <li> Prior to him using this sleep mask he was talking about painting our bedroom a darker color and putting black curtains on our windows.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever use a sleep mask because the ones I&#x27;ve tried in the past were not comfortable and would slip off and let the light in but with this one I haven&#x27;t had any problems it fits well and stays in place.</li>
            <li> for the ear plugs, they are pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> so there are always sounds from other apartments and lights in my windows at night, so</li>
            <li> so there are always sounds from other apartments and lights in my windows at night, so</li>
            <li> not sure WHAT the extra material on the bottom of the mask is for, but placing it over the tip of my nose in an attempt to &#x27;stabilize&#x27; the mask prevented me from breathing through my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have darkness or tight places issues you will have issues because it lets NO light in, which is what you want for a deep sleep, during daylight or night time hours</li>
            <li> /&gt;Only negative I have to say about this mask is the material of the actual mask itself isn&#x27;t the softest.</li>
            <li> and it has saved me the agony of having my bedroom redecorated depressingly to dark for my taste.    </li>
            <li> A little bulky but it works.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other sleep masks in the past, and all they do is slide around and come off.  </li>
            <li> so you need to air it out for a few days.</li>
            <li> No light gets through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> no light whatsoever will be getting under this mask!</li>
            <li> No more lights in my face while I sleep.</li>
            <li> My sleep mask kit from Valhalla came with the mask, ear plugs, and small carrying bag for them.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> Normally I am not able to wear sleep masks because they push on my eyes and the elastic band starts to give me a headache after a while, so I end up throwing them off before I even get to sleep.</li>
            <li> It also has small vents on the sides so that air can flow through as well.</li>
            <li> usually use silicone ear plugs because I have yet to find ear plugs that mute noises like silicone ear plugs.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time going to sleep sometimes</li>
            <li> so I had a hard time keeping this mask on throughout the night.</li>
            <li> Hard to sleep on your side as the mask sometimes moves.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time sleeping.  </li>
            <li> No more sleepless nights!</li>
            <li> But we know that even if a product is affordable, that doesn’t mean that you should purchase it without analyzing every aspect of it, so we decided to undertake the task of reviewing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the mask is moulded the eye &#x27;patches&#x27; give you plenty of room behind for your eyes to move around under the mask without feeling restricted in any way.  </li>
            <li> I do have long eyelashes and find this really annoying as I am trying to go to sleep.</li>
            <li> I hate this mask, if you want to sleep on your side or stomach forget about it because your eyes will get crushed into your skull, the mask slips off</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone that has a difficult time sleeping or staying asleep!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone that has a difficult time sleeping or staying asleep!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to find a mask that comes accompanied by these qualities, but just like everything else in this life, the mask has something that may be a downfall for some individuals.</li>

            <li> when they sleep&amp;#34; that&#x27;s practically impossible with two.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with your purchase.</li>
            <li> I even had to call my mom and tell her all about it because she knows about my horrible insomnia!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this mask really keeps light out. no joke. no light whatsoever will be getting under this mask! it comes with ear plugs and a small drawstring bag to store the mask in which would be great to travel with as a bonus. it also has a velcro strap versus the regular elastic straps that typically stretch out and loosen on regular sleep masks. This is nice velcro too. It will hold together for a very long while. The sleep mask also has this thin black material that goes over your nose to help keep the light out that sometimes peeks in from the nose cutouts. It is easy to breathe with the material covering your nose but personally i don&#x27;t like it over my nose so i pull it as far down as comfortable. But this extra material is what makes this mask so different than others because this is the key to blocking out the light and is why you have 100% total darkness when wearing this sleep mask.  It also has air vents on the sides of the mask that is said to help prevent wrinkling and sore eyes. The air vents are designed to breath while you sleep and to keep your skin and eyes from drying out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only negative I have to say about this mask is the material of the actual mask itself isn&#x27;t the softest. It&#x27;s a thicker, quality material, it&#x27;s made great and very durable but I like the soft, silky feeling of other sleeping masks better. But all in all I 110% recommend this sleep mask to EVERYONE who wants a good, quality mask at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I just loveeee this, its super durable and great to travel with..</li>
            <li> No more lights in my face while I sleep. I sleep right by the bathroom, in which I leave the light on because I have a little one who needs to see light in the hall. The closest thing to that would be the bathroom.  While using this sleep mask, no light seeps through and I no longer wake up in the middle of the night wishing I could just turn the darn light off, lol. I cant though. The ear buds that come with the sleep mask are a help too. I don&#x27;t use them to sleep though, since I have children, I have to be able to hear through the night, but I do use them for when I&#x27;m doing homework, or when I&#x27;m meditating. They work great for blocking noise. Overall, a well recommended product.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic sleep mask. I have a hard time going to sleep sometimes and whenever I know I won&#x27;t fall asleep easily, I place the easy to use sleep mask on my face and voila. No more sleepless nights! I also bought my friends daughter one who is 9 and she absolutely loves it. It makes her feel like a grown up. I highly recommend this mask!</li>
            <li> My sleep mask kit from Valhalla came with the mask, ear plugs, and small carrying bag for them.&lt;br /&gt;If anyone would like to know there are some real differences in sleep masks. This Valhalla sleep mask is among one of the better I have seen or tested. This mask is very well consturcted. The material is smooth to the skin almost as nice as silk. I comes with to vents, one on each side of the mask that allows the eyes to be able to breath all night. These vents are set up in a way that does not allow light into the eye area covered by the mask. Next is the velcro strap that attaches around the head to hold it in place. This also makes the mask adjustable to the wearers head. There is also a soft cloth that goes over the end of the nose. This really helps to keep the mask in place. Most masks do not offer this, and it is great for people that move their forehead and brings the mask up into the eyes. It really cuts down on this travel motion. They eye cups are not of a pre-formed material and can be kind of stretched to help hold it off of the eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback from the mask is the eye cups. They are not formed and do not do a well job of keeping off of my eyelashes. I do have long eyelashes and find this really annoying as I am trying to go to sleep. Even though going to sleep means closing my eyes and not moving my lids, but I have never been one to go to sleep quickly.&lt;br /&gt;The only other thing to comment on is the piece of cloth that goes over the end of the nose. It works great in stopping the movement of the mask. It does take a little bit of time to get used to for sure. The piece of cloth is very soft and almost rubber bandish type material.&lt;br /&gt;Now for the ear plugs, they are pretty much useless. They only muffle sound barely, I was able to hear ever word being said to me while having in the ear plugs and without anyone having to change their tone or level of their voices.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to thank Vallhalla Goods for allowing me to try out this mask.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone in the market for a sleep mask could use this sleep mask for sure.his mask.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone in the market for a sleep mask could use this sleep mask for sure.</li>
            <li> I really love the air vents on the side of the mask, because my face doesn&#x27;t get all hot and sweaty during the night like it has with other masks. I also like that it&#x27;s not pressed up against my eyes. My eyes are free to blink as needed. The only reason I&#x27;m not giving this a 5 star review is the fact of the package was crushed so the mask was crushed in when I got it. I formed it back the best that I could and it seems to work great. OH, something else I really liked that you can&#x27;t see in the picture is there is a soft black piece of material that goes across the bridge of the nose to help block out the light, but doesn&#x27;t hurt against the nose.</li>
            <li> I love the eye mask. It blocks out the light completely and the vents prevent my face from getting overheated. The storage bag is perfect as it keeps the mask clean and close by when not using. The only time I have used the ear plugs is when kids are in school as I do not want to sleep through my alarm clock. This is a great buy if your issue is not being able to sleep because of it being to bright. You just have to learn how it can impact your movement til you get used to it.</li>
            <li> I had a great night sleep with this mask and earplugs it was so nice to keep the pesky sun from ruining my sleep after the time change I have been getting woken up over an hour earlier it was getting old. Thank you Gateway International for providing me with this sleep mask to improve the quality of my sleep.</li>
            <li> This sleep mask is really a quality product. The mask itself is very comfortable to wear and actually keeps All of the light out. The Velcro straps allow you to adjust the mask to your comfort level. There are vents on the sides of the mask to keep air circulating so your eyes will not dry out. Also a pair of ear plugs comes with this sleeping mask ( very useful). I would highly recommend getting this Sleep mask. You will not be disappointed with your purchase. (I received this product complimentary for my review, but my opinions are my own).</li>
            <li> I bought this product for $1 as part of a promotion but then spent another $35 shipping it back to the UK.  Lucky for me it&#x27;s an excellent mask.  A little smelly when it first comes out of it&#x27;s packaging as it must have a plastic mould under the soft exterior but once aired it does a great job shutting out the light so you can get a good nights sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally didn&#x27;t have any issues using on my side, as others have found.  It&#x27;s got velcro fastenings at the back so you can quickly and easily get the straps to fit securely round your head.  It comes with a couple of ear plugs, but I&#x27;ve never found I can sleep with those so haven&#x27;t used them (more likely to put them in to drown out the sound of &#x27;Gems TV&#x27; or something similar when my wife puts it on).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the mask is moulded the eye &#x27;patches&#x27; give you plenty of room behind for your eyes to move around under the mask without feeling restricted in any way.  There are also air vents to stop you over heating.  All in all it&#x27;s a great mask.</li>
            <li> I have tried several sleeping masks and some works for awhile and then they get stretched out or start to unravel. I have a lot of medical problems that keeps me awake at night. So,it is real hard to get a full night&#x27;s rest. If I could get a few hours at a time I would be very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in an apartment so you know that you hear everything it seems like when you are trying to sleep. So I decided to try the Best Rem Sleep Mask by Gateway International and I am glad that I did. First of all it does keep all the light out and the ear plugs are made of high quality so that you don&#x27;t hear every little noise around you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask itself is soft and designed with dual vent holes two breathe so it will not dry your skin and eyes.&lt;br /&gt;The Mask comes with a carry pouch ( which by the way is a very nice pouch), ear plugs and a 25 Effective Sleep Secrets Ebook and a sleep diary!&lt;br /&gt;All the stuff that comes with it is nice quality and very usable. The sleep diary is great for recording your sleep patterns in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad that I received for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. This is my opinion and mine only.</li>
            <li> A little bulky but it works.  Light still manages to come through from underneath sometimes...</li>
            <li> I have severe insomnia, so I&#x27;m always looking for something that will help me sleep more soundly at night. I tend to stay awake because I have very sensitive hearing so any little noise will wake me up, then I can&#x27;t fall back to sleep. I have tried using sleep masks because they block out the light so I&#x27;m not bothered by that, but they have never worked for me. I recently received the Valhalla Serenity Sleep Mask Set and I have been using it every night.&lt;br /&gt;The Valhalla Sleep Mask Set comes with earplugs, a sleep mask, a carry pouch, and an audio book and sleep diary. The sleep mask itself is my favorite part of this whole set! Normally I am not able to wear sleep masks because they push on my eyes and the elastic band starts to give me a headache after a while, so I end up throwing them off before I even get to sleep. The first night I tried this Valhalla Sleep mask I noticed that it didn&#x27;t push on my eyes or give me a headache and I was thoroughly impressed! I put on the sleep mask and next thing I knew I was waking up the following morning I even had to call my mom and tell her all about it because she knows about my horrible insomnia!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Valhalla Sleep Mask is an extremely high quality eye mask. It is rounded in the front so that it doesn&#x27;t push against your eyes, this is great because when you go into REM sleep your eyes actually move and flutter, and it fully blocks out all light. The eye mask also has air vents on the sides to prevent your eyes and skin from drying out. This Valhalla Sleep mask also has an adjustable elastic strap in the back so that you can adjust it to fit your head perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the fact that the Valhalla Serenity Sleep Mask Set comes with everything you would need to have a restful night of sleep. The earplugs are great quality, and the carry case is nice to have, that way you throw everything in the bag that you need for sleep and you&#x27;re good to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Valhalla Serenity Sleep Mask Set has been a life saver for me! I live in an apartment so there are always sounds from other apartments and lights in my windows at night, so it&#x27;s great that I have this wonderful set to keep me sleeping soundly. I recommend this to anyone that has a difficult time sleeping or staying asleep!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased review.en a life saver for me!

            <li> I&#x27;m super impressed with this sleep mask I think its really effective and well designed. I really like the fact that this sleep mask is light weight and is rounded in the front so that it doesn&#x27;t push against your eyes which makes it more comfortable than other sleep masks I&#x27;ve tried. I used this sleep mask during a car trip not only did it do a fantastic job blocking all the light out but the mask didn&#x27;t smear my eye makeup at all. This sleep mask definitely does what its suppose to do. I hardly ever use a sleep mask because the ones I&#x27;ve tried in the past were not comfortable and would slip off and let the light in but with this one I haven&#x27;t had any problems it fits well and stays in place. Even my Fiance loves this sleep mask. I found it hilarious because I would have never pictured him wearing a sleep mask. He works nights and by the time he gets home and unwinds its already noon so he was having a tough time sleeping because of the light. Prior to him using this sleep mask he was talking about painting our bedroom a darker color and putting black curtains on our windows. So I&#x27;m kind of indebted to this sleep mask its helped my Fiance sleep well again and it has saved me the agony of having my bedroom redecorated depressingly to dark for my taste.    *I was given this product free to review but regardless all opinions are my own*</li>
            <li> When the rooster sings at 6 a.m. and then soon after the bright morning sunrays bombard your face while you are in your sleep--can definitely be a very upsetting situation to say the least. When your sleep is interrupted, you are not able to function throughout the day as you normally would if you would&#x27;ve gotten an uninterrupted sleep. Even if you fall asleep after your sleep has come into a halt, it won’t be the same. This leads us to finding a solution for this every day matter that millions of individuals, around the globe, suffer from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The market is saturated with products that can help resolve this daily issue, such as sleep masks and earplugs. Of course, you would have to buy both items to have a peaceful sleep and wakeup whenever your body feels reenergized, without the interruption of sound or light. But which product is the best option for your wallet? That’s the million dollar question! It is difficult to say which one is the best of the best, but if we take a look at reviews of different sleep masks and earplugs, we might come close to finding an answer to this question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one product, in particular, that has more positive reviews than anything else on several well-known and reputable online sites, where customers are allowed to rate and review their most recent purchases: Serenity Sleep Mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What caught our eye about this product, besides its innumerable positive reviews, is that it comes along with high-quality earplugs and that it&#x27;s being offered at a super very low price. It is quite shocking how a manufacturer can provide a top-notch sleep mask and earplugs at such a ‘wow’ low price. But we know that even if a product is affordable, that doesn’t mean that you should purchase it without analyzing every aspect of it, so we decided to undertake the task of reviewing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Serenity Sleep Mask fully blocks light and sound with the included earplugs. According to its manufacturer, it can last for many years. It comes with a one year full warranty. Both items are constructed of advanced materials that provide a heavy duty construction that is feather-light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The sleep mask prevents sore and wrinkling eyes. It is designed to breath, while you get your rest, with dual air vents. This helps keep your eyes and skin from drying out. If you are the type of individuals who often moves a lot in your sleep, you can rest assured that this mask won’t come loose or flatten. It allows for unrestricted eye-movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These two products come accompanied with a carry pouch, sleep diary, and the 25 ‘Effective Sleep Secrets eBook.’ The mask is hand washable, hypoallergenic, has no latex, and one size fits all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can tell, the Serenity Sleep Mask package is one-of-a-kind. It is very difficult to find a mask that comes accompanied by these qualities, but just like everything else in this life, the mask has something that may be a downfall for some individuals. It is made of a silk-like material, not cotton. So if you are the type of individual who doesn’t like very soft material on your face, then this product may not be suited for you. Other than that, the Serenity Sleep Mask is a fantastic product that really does live up to the hype that surrounds it; therefore, we highly recommend it.for many years.

            <li> I originally bought this for my 5 year old son for travel, as he needed the air vents to reduce eczema from dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I love the cool darkness from this mask, it does not work for very young children. Customer service was friendly and offered a refund.</li>
            <li> A great sleep mask. The strap isn&#x27;t too bulky so if you roll over on it, you aren&#x27;t bothered. Really does keep out all light and the breather sides are wonderful!</li>
            <li> I received this product free for testing via Tomoson. I found this to be a really nice product, perfect especially for those who travel, since the eyes aren&#x27;t right against the head it didn&#x27;t bother my makeup while sleeping on a plane, yet the nose allows the mask to keep any and all light out. it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> Very helpful for sleeping. No longer have to worry about my roommate&#x27;s desk light or anything of the sort. Only down side is it falls off in the middle of the night, so I have to go searching for it in the morning. Other than that it&#x27;s great,</li>
            <li> I had never used sleep mask before receiving the Valhalla mask. As someone who prefers to sleep in complete and total darkness, I was excited to try it, but worried it would be uncomfortable. The product, however, is well-made and easy to use. I didn&#x27;t have a problem. The adjustable strap makes it easy to secure it around my head, and the vents are a nice touch as well. The earplugs are a nice bonus, as I sometimes nap during the day. This makes it easy to block the sounds of others in the house. *Product was provided by the company to facilitate this review, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li> **I RECEIVED THIS ITEM IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this mask for maybe 30 minutes tops before I gave up and took it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a side sleeper. The plastic of the side vents and the seams on the sides bore into my head, not allowing me to get comfortable enough to even TRY to fall asleep. The more I tried to get comfortable, the more the mask shifted and slid around my face and head. I even tried to sleep on my hands, in hopes of putting some room between the pillow and the mask. This just made the problem worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure WHAT the extra material on the bottom of the mask is for, but placing it over the tip of my nose in an attempt to &#x27;stabilize&#x27; the mask prevented me from breathing through my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I removed the mask, I was able to fall asleep quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only &#x27;saving grace&#x27; of this mask was the bonus ear plugs, which my roommate tried, since I am prone to ear infections/blockages. She says the ear plugs do muffle/block most noises, but if it&#x27;s a loud noise, it will not be blocked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this product. If you&#x27;re looking for a sleep mask, just keep looking.</li>
            <li> It definitely keeps the light out and drowns out the noise. I highly recommend this sleep mask and ear plugs for a good nights rest/</li>
            <li> I looked at what similar items were offering before choosing to purchase this one and I am glad I did; because this was my first such product, I did not want any regrets. I bought this one because it was hand-washable - had no latex - is Hypoallergenic - and I could be sure it would fit not just me but my wife if it came down to that because one size fits all. On top of that, there is the awesome manufacturer warranty so I pulled the trigger and made the purchase. It is worth what I paid and more. It includes not just the mask but a set of ear plugs and a drawstring bag to put the mask in when I awake. Using it is easy too. It is made with Velcro but not the cheap, everyday, Velcro but the one which does not make a load of noise when you move, essential when sleep won&#x27;t come easy... making it an even more awesome product. Being my first sleep mask, I soon learned the inevitable -- falling on my back is a must and so it works perfectly when I travel, (on buses, trains, plains, passenger in other vehicles, etc.) its&#x27; main purpose, and when I fall asleep in my bed. The product is soft and well made. It is quite stylish too and it just works. Put it on and it is total blackout. I mean real lights out even with ceiling or bedside lamps on. If you have darkness or tight places issues you will have issues because it lets NO light in, which is what you want for a deep sleep, during daylight or night time hours, I hear. I will buy another this shopping season for friends and family -- just do not tell them... OK?</li>
            <li> I have a hard time falling asleep most nights and this mask helps block out light distractions that hinder me from falling asleep. I&#x27;m a side sleeper so I had a hard time keeping this mask on throughout the night. I tend to toss and turn. This mask is made so that it does not sit directly on your eyes so it won&#x27;t crush your eyelashes. It also has small vents on the sides so that air can flow through as well. This mask is also adjustable so that it can be adjusted to fit just right. This mask also came with earplugs and nice bag to put the mask and earplugs in for easy travel. This would come in handy for someone who travels a lot. Another benefit for me from this mask is it helps with my migraines. I suffer from migraines at least 1 to 2 a week and light sensitivity is one of my biggest symptoms. I thought this mask was OK. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for a side sleeper or for someone who tosses and turns a lot. It won&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li> Blocks out all light which is cool. Hard to sleep on your side as the mask sometimes moves.</li>
            <li> Great product that allows for REM. It is the only one I have found that completely blocks all light. The only downside is a temporary one. It reeks of cheap plastic when you take it out of the bag so you need to air it out for a few days. No problems after that. There is a holder on the strap for the ear plugs like a bandolier. I will be getting another one for my wife.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mask, ever since I had my second child I haven&#x27;t been sleeping. With your first they say &amp;#34;sleep when they sleep&amp;#34; that&#x27;s practically impossible with two. So when I can sleep I try to make it count. After my baby still sleeps in the bedroom with me, I have it lit with nightlights. This mask has completely blocked out all light, even in the daylight hours. I could be outside in the middle of the day, and not know it while wearing this. It is fully adjustable, and comfortable. It is thicker then your standard cheap dollar store brand or the cheap ones you get on airplanes. It&#x27;s 100% worth the money. And has given me the ability to sleep better at nights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New studies about sleep deprivation in America point to how many lights are surrounding us (phones, alarm clocks, etc.) all providing too much light. Evolutionarily, humans have evolved to sleep in total darkness and this mask gives you the blackout your brain&#x27;s occipital lobe requires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest trying this instead of sleeping pills - it may work for you instead, and will be a lot cheaper, and healthier in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this product 5 STARS!</li>
            <li> I have a hard time sleeping.  I like things pitch black, but there is always a light on somewhere.  I have tried other sleep masks in the past, and all they do is slide around and come off.  This sleep mask does not do that!  It stays in place.  No light gets through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use silicone ear plugs because I have yet to find ear plugs that mute noises like silicone ear plugs.  The ear plugs that come with this sleep mask mute the noises like silicone ear plugs.  They are easy to put in and are comfortable.  I love them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a great night&#x27;s sleep using this sleep mask and the ear plugs.  I love the little bag that you can put them in once you wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li> I hate this mask, if you want to sleep on your side or stomach forget about it because your eyes will get crushed into your skull, the mask slips off and I just can&#x27;t believe I bought this product NEVER AGAIN!</li>
            <li> Have used it three nights, and I do sleep better. But it has a strong industrial chemical odor, and my poor dry eyes aren&#x27;t feeling any benefit yet.</li>
