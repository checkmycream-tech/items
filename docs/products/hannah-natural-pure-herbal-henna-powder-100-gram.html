            <li>I love it, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>REALLY LOVED THIS.</li>
            <li>pictures aren&#x27;t the best, but I haven&#x27;t really had time to take a good one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was my first time using herbal dye, and it worked out perfectly.</li>
            <li>Love this purchase!</li>
            <li>I was so pleased!</li>
            <li>used to use Hennalucent, which I really liked</li>
            <li>I really liked this one.</li>
            <li>Her hair are gray and it covored nicely with desired color.</li>
            <li>amazing results-flattered by the color,softness and how shiny and Healthy</li>
            <li>I recommend using warm vinegar and lemon juice for better results</li>
            <li>All natural and works great!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the best sense of smell, so it may be different to others, but I liked it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with my hair&#x27;s natural-looking copper colour and shine after using this product for the first time today.</li>
            <li>Love this I get compliments everywhere on the color.  </li>
            <li>, I love, love, love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, now I got it :)</li>
            <li>but it was more orange than the picture shows.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>ITS A PLANT... :)</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product.</li>
            <li>Anyway, there will be a LOT of washout when you rinse it, but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Much better than chemical colors for sure.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It did NOT leave my hair feeling smooth at all!</li>
            <li>hair is a beautiful, natural looking orange.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!!!&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful full &amp; rich color, my hair is noticeably more healthy &amp; shiny now</li>
            <li>Although, a lot of people said it looked nice, it wasn&#x27;t my intention, and I didn&#x27;t exactly like it.</li>
            <li>Kind of like when you mix hot cocoa, but it takes a lot longer.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s very cost effective in fact</li>
            <li>I like easy, pretty, healthy, effortless...</li>
            <li>It mixed well and the color was very nice.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soooo worth the time!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It came out light like I wanted, a bit more orange than I had hoped but much lighter than the box.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really cheap and comes with 2 bags, which was good for me, because I only needed one.</li>
            <li>It does not cause the bright red as pictured, but, maybe it depends on the color your hair is before using the product.  </li>
            <li>However it still dyed my hair red but didn&#x27;t come out as bright as I wanted.</li>
            <li>Given its reasonable price, I&#x27;ll buy this henna brand again for sure.</li>
            <li>JUST PULL HAIR FROM A FULL HAIRBRUSH AND FASHION</li>
            <li>I recommend liberally applying moisturiser to the ears and hairline, using disposable latex gloves (not the plastic ones provided), wearing dark-coloured clothing during application, and quickly cleaning up any bathroom surface &#x27;spills&#x27; to avoid any unwanted stains.</li>
            <li>It left a stench on my hair weeks after I applied it, after many washings!</li>
            <li>And it was kind of red</li>
            <li>but I was convinced that it would be worth it for the color in the end.</li>
            <li>This mixture has just the right amount of orange to balance out</li>
            <li>I used sulfate-free conditioner after rinsing with warm water for a long time and it seems fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried for nearly 8 months to get a nice, natural looking orange color for my hair.</li>
            <li>I had recently cut it and it felt fine!</li>
            <li>but I wanted to make sure that I would do it right especially since I was going to be using Henna for the first time</li>
            <li>I love how henna has turned my once broken hair, to strong hair that I can &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; and I have been able to grow it without it looking stringy.  </li>
            <li>I bought traditional Nice &#x27;N Easy platinum blonde to lighten my hair before using the henna</li>
            <li>So this is my first Henna experience.</li>
            <li>The first bag I used as described on the package on my hair and my son&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t really love the color choices they had for red</li>
            <li>definitely recommend this product, but as with any herbal dye, make sure you do A TON of research beforehand.</li>
            <li>Next time I use this one, I&#x27;m going to try washing it out as soon as I finish applying and see if that will work better for me.</li>
            <li>I had light blonde hair and it made my hair a pretty orange, doesn&#x27;t run or stain clothing afterwards.</li>
            <li>Because I haven&#x27;t seen this color being offered in too many other places and I&#x27;m willing to admit I haven&#x27;t done much searching, I was still willing to try it</li>
            <li>But as I dried my hair, it was like magic!</li>
            <li>I decided to try henna for the first time in a few years, after tiring of harsh regrowth lines from Clairol&#x27;s Nice &amp; Easy (110 Natural Light Auburn) and Garnier&#x27;s Olia (6.43 Light Natural Auburn) products.</li>
            <li>bought 4 boxes and only used 1/2 box for my medium lenght, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Light Mountain was so complicated and Colora was so messy.&lt;br /&gt;Hannah was smooth and creamy and simple with good results.  </li>
            <li>Was better than I expected.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m ready when the time ever comes for grays</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair is very crunchy.</li>
            <li>very much appreciated</li>
            <li>Imagine my surprise when my hair turned out a light strawberry blonde!</li>
            <li>This is the only henna I will use now because It is l00% chemical free and</li>
            <li>It was much darker than I was expecting but it worked for me</li>
            <li>It made my hair VERY orange.</li>
            <li>I have received quite a few nice compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li>It turned out to be the most natural copper color possible.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used henna on my hair many times, and though this is a compound with other herbs, I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>YOU GET THE COLOR ON THE BOX - IT WILL EVEN BE MORE OF AN INTENSE PINKY RED IF YOU&#x27;RE A BLONDE.</li>
            <li>It says on the box 4-6 weeks for the lasting ability and it is completely true.</li>
            <li>I have used this particular brand twice, and have reordered it.  </li>
            <li>My natural hair is an ash blonde light brown.</li>
            <li>I had to cut the worst parts of my hair off that would not be able to recover with even the best hair treatments.</li>
            <li>hair was a faded light orange-ish pink color when I dyed it.</li>
            <li>To combat henna&#x27;s &#x27;naturally earthy&#x27; smell and sometimes drying effect, I mixed one 50g package with hot water, 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, 1 tablespoon of coconut oil and 1/2 to 1 teaspoon each of cinnamon, cloves, ginger and vanilla essence which produced a smooth and creamy texture.</li>
            <li>I waited about 5 days after coloring with that before using the henna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I researched heavily and watched many YouTube videos on how to dye with henna</li>
            <li>It was okay, since I didn&#x27;t want to waste anymore time dying it</li>
            <li>My hair is sort of long, to my ribcage and one box was more than enough.</li>
            <li>The product is exactly what was expected, even better than other henna I have ever used (and I have been using henna for 7 years).</li>
            <li>(number included in the box, very helpful!)  and asked the person who answered about possibly using chamomile tea and how to make the dye lighter.  </li>
            <li>I left the dye on for 3 hours, and it&#x27;s exactly the color I was hoping for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know why someone would ever do chemical coloring for red when it fades so fast!</li>
            <li>This is not a bad product but not exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The box comes with two large packages of powder and with my short hair half of one is more than enough.</li>
            <li>I put the henna on and I noticed that it makes your hair rather stiff, but even though it&#x27;s a paste, it is still rather easily to apply.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m switching back to the pure henna.</li>
            <li>Using my old shampoo bottle, I add about 1/4 cup of this plus water</li>
            <li>I did that about 5 times, now my hair is completely reddish, darkish brown, any grays</li>
            <li>He said that if I left the dye out overnight like some people suggested on the videos then the color would be much stronger, so I stuck with the directions included on the box.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as frizzy as it use to be and with the natural looking highlights/</li>
            <li>I wanted to find a color to cover grays and blend with my natural color.</li>
            <li>I left it on as long as they say to, and I&#x27;m sure it was too long.</li>
            <li>I want it to still look natural.</li>
            <li>When it was mixed, the measuring cup had a total worth of 2 cups of dye.</li>
            <li>I have naturally red hair, light auburn, dark orange, ginger - whatever you might want to call it.  </li>
            <li>and I left the solution on my hair for approx 70 minutes, after looping it into a high bun and donning the provided plastic shower cap.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY SUGGEST A STRAND TEST EACH AND EVERY TIME YOU USE HENNA - DIFFERENT HARVESTS</li>
            <li>My (previously coloured) hair is naturally a straight, fine, dark auburn that falls just below my shoulder blades.</li>
            <li>I figured it would just put a red tinge over my dark hair, but it really did lighten it, much to my surprise, but the red wasn&#x27;t nearly as intense as the picture.</li>
            <li>Would not buy again left my natural red hair a funny color and continued to come off on everything for three weeks later!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also a cosmetologist, so believe me when I say compared to chemical coloring this stuff is amazing and can be used on women who are pregnant or unable to use harsh chemical coloring on there scalp.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I bought this from a third party seller through Amazon, because I was intrigued by the deep orange color it promised to give; but the it arrived in my mailbox squished flat and the henna spilling all over the envelope.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any reviews from people who are trying to keep their red hair red, mostly just people with brown, black or blonde hair, looking to go red.</li>
            <li>my natural hair color is brown with some white in front at hairline.  </li>
            <li>it took me about a year trying out different ways to use natural hair color</li>
            <li>I have tried nearly every brand that comes in a box at my local stores, to no prevail.</li>
            <li>They would either wash out completely after the initial rinsing, or they would already be faded the following day.  </li>
            <li>I used about a cup of hot Sleepytime tea (it has chamomile in it) and used a little at a time, mixing it into a plastic bowl with both included packages of henna in this box until it was the consistency of ketchup, like it said.  </li>
            <li>I wish my eyebrows were the same color, but I don&#x27;t want to dye my eyebrows, so I just color them with a little bit of orange eye-shadow and then people think that the orange is my real hair color!</li>

            <li> It was okay, since I didn&#x27;t want to waste anymore time dying it</li>
            <li> My hair is sort of long, to my ribcage and one box was more than enough.</li>
            <li> The product is exactly what was expected, even better than other henna I have ever used (and I have been using henna for 7 years).</li>
            <li> (number included in the box, very helpful!)  and asked the person who answered about possibly using chamomile tea and how to make the dye lighter.  </li>
            <li> I left the dye on for 3 hours, and it&#x27;s exactly the color I was hoping for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why someone would ever do chemical coloring for red when it fades so fast!</li>
            <li> This is not a bad product but not exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The box comes with two large packages of powder and with my short hair half of one is more than enough.</li>
            <li> I put the henna on and I noticed that it makes your hair rather stiff, but even though it&#x27;s a paste, it is still rather easily to apply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m switching back to the pure henna.</li>
            <li> Using my old shampoo bottle, I add about 1/4 cup of this plus water</li>
            <li> I did that about 5 times, now my hair is completely reddish, darkish brown, any grays</li>
            <li> He said that if I left the dye out overnight like some people suggested on the videos then the color would be much stronger, so I stuck with the directions included on the box.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as frizzy as it use to be and with the natural looking highlights/</li>
            <li> I wanted to find a color to cover grays and blend with my natural color.</li>
            <li> I left it on as long as they say to, and I&#x27;m sure it was too long.</li>
            <li> I want it to still look natural.</li>
            <li> When it was mixed, the measuring cup had a total worth of 2 cups of dye.</li>
            <li> I have naturally red hair, light auburn, dark orange, ginger - whatever you might want to call it.  </li>
            <li> and I left the solution on my hair for approx 70 minutes, after looping it into a high bun and donning the provided plastic shower cap.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY SUGGEST A STRAND TEST EACH AND EVERY TIME YOU USE HENNA - DIFFERENT HARVESTS</li>
            <li> My (previously coloured) hair is naturally a straight, fine, dark auburn that falls just below my shoulder blades.</li>
            <li> I figured it would just put a red tinge over my dark hair, but it really did lighten it, much to my surprise, but the red wasn&#x27;t nearly as intense as the picture.</li>
            <li> Would not buy again left my natural red hair a funny color and continued to come off on everything for three weeks later!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also a cosmetologist, so believe me when I say compared to chemical coloring this stuff is amazing and can be used on women who are pregnant or unable to use harsh chemical coloring on there scalp.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I bought this from a third party seller through Amazon, because I was intrigued by the deep orange color it promised to give; but the it arrived in my mailbox squished flat and the henna spilling all over the envelope.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any reviews from people who are trying to keep their red hair red, mostly just people with brown, black or blonde hair, looking to go red.</li>
            <li> my natural hair color is brown with some white in front at hairline.  </li>
            <li> it took me about a year trying out different ways to use natural hair color</li>
            <li> I have tried nearly every brand that comes in a box at my local stores, to no prevail.</li>
            <li> They would either wash out completely after the initial rinsing, or they would already be faded the following day.  </li>
            <li> I used about a cup of hot Sleepytime tea (it has chamomile in it) and used a little at a time, mixing it into a plastic bowl with both included packages of henna in this box until it was the consistency of ketchup, like it said.  </li>
            <li> I wish my eyebrows were the same color, but I don&#x27;t want to dye my eyebrows, so I just color them with a little bit of orange eye-shadow and then people think that the orange is my real hair color!</li>
            <li> and I leave the henna in for at least 3 hours to get the right deep red color result.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve washed my hair a few times since and it is still vibrant.</li>
            <li> last&#x27;s ridiculously long!</li>
            <li> So I have figured out, if your hair is already red, then you should not leave it on very long at all.</li>
            <li> let it dry and left it on.</li>
            <li> the red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been dying my hair red for years with chemical dyes, but I stripped it down to my natural dark blonde, so my roots wouldn&#x27;t end up three shades lighter than the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li> It did not last forever like others claimed and when I tried it the second time I googled other methods of henna and let it sit overnight with lemon juice and applied it.</li>
            <li> I read online and mix mine differently than the direction on the box ( which is very vague) but after doing my research you can make your own concoctions using tea, oil, lemon and other additives</li>
            <li> Just do Henna because it lasts just as long or even longer, and isn&#x27;t harmful to the hair or scalp.</li>
            <li> I have quite a bit of grey and it covered it</li>
            <li> downside is it&#x27;s time consuming; it has to stay in for a long time however, I have medium brown hair</li>
            <li> The instructions are a little vague, but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I don&#x27;t like, is it looks so natural compared to my REAL natural eyebrow color of a dirty blonde.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally dark blonde</li>
            <li> (it turned out dark blonde).  </li>
            <li> Boxed dyes usually require me to use 2 complete boxes to cover everything.</li>
            <li> I still have half a bag left</li>
            <li> While the color lasts, this made my hair very dry and the earthy smell lingers for quite some time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will never use any other type of dye for as long as I decide I want my hair to be orange.</li>
            <li> Am I wrong to assume that pure henna, will only say henna in the ingredients list?&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> When I apply my final 50g package in a few weeks&#x27; time, I&#x27;ll try leaving it on for the recommended 90 to 120 minutes to compare the colour intensity.</li>
            <li> That is partly my fault for not reading the description carefully but the name of the produce misleading.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to use just henna, because my skin has pink undertones, and I didn&#x27;t want to end up looking like Jigglypuff.</li>
            <li> get the powder inside wet.</li>
            <li> After washing, conditioning and blow-drying my hair it definitely smelled less &#x27;earthy&#x27; than with previous henna applications and turned out just the colour I hoped for.</li>
            <li> mentioned in other reviews, it does have a earthy smell.</li>
            <li> Not exactly the look that I&#x27;m going for.</li>
            <li> Right after I rinsed my hair, I was frustrated to see the yellow hue and brownish color</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find out that this isn&#x27;t pure henna but a mix of different plants.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ll try a little vinegar too, I read it helps hold the color), I washed my hair with it, combed out any clumps,</li>
            <li> The powder might ball up a little bit and you&#x27;ll need to break it t</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I purchased this dye, It sat in my cupboard for a few weeks, because I was a little nervous to try it.</li>
            <li> Application was predictably messy (it&#x27;s almost like coating your hair with mud)</li>
            <li> its messy so just makesure you have towels covering everything</li>
            <li> Kinda like green tea.</li>
            <li> After some research I was warned to be wary of commercially prepared \\&quot;compound\\&quot; hennas which should be avoided at all costs by people with relaxed hair like mine.</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m not sure about the color.</li>
            <li> At least isn&#x27;t harsh chemicals!</li>
            <li> AT LEAST 4 HOURS OF TIME.</li>
            <li> However after using this product it left my hair feeling extremely dry the way horribly bleached hair feels.</li>
            <li> This brand had worked every since time in the past, but it failed also.</li>
            <li> My baby thin hair immediately got stronger and thicker.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the color it leaves us way off.  </li>
            <li> This is a fake product.</li>
            <li> The mix is this nasty looking green mess that smells kinda bad though (reminded me of edamame), but, it works.</li>
            <li> Its very messy but doesn&#x27;t have a horrible smell.</li>
            <li> it smells really bad, but the colour is great!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> and it did nothing. :(</li>
            <li> I tried using liquid cremes that you mix with developer, because they had been recommended to me by my friends, those also failed miserably.</li>
            <li> It was very unpleasant to have to smell that for the time the gunk was in my hair</li>
            <li> I have seen people who colored their hair with chemichal products and it is so unnatural looking that it looks awful.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never had a color that worked so horribly.</li>
            <li> It was horrible!</li>
            <li> Also note that while you have this gunk in your hair because it looks like GUNK, that it will smell horribly!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this I get compliments everywhere on the color.  And it&#x27;s very cost effective in fact I&#x27;m doing it now</li>
            <li> This product is simple to use, gave color it indicated on the box.  It covered all my gray.  It&#x27;s a good product for a great price.&lt;br /&gt;I bought 4 boxes and only used 1/2 box for my medium lenght, fine hair.  The color blends in, the gray hair picked up more&lt;br /&gt;of the orange color but it still blends in.  I have seen people who colored their hair with chemichal products and it is so unnatural looking that it looks awful.  With this product, it looks like highlights.&lt;br /&gt;I used to use Hennalucent, which I really liked and since they took it off market, have been looking for a comparable product.&lt;br /&gt;I think this one is close, just wish they had it in Auburn.  Light Mountain was so complicated and Colora was so messy.&lt;br /&gt;Hannah was smooth and creamy and simple with good results.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with Henna, but some are better than others.</li>
            <li> Was better than I expected. I have received quite a few nice compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li> amazing results-flattered by the color,softness and how shiny and Healthy my hair has become..</li>
            <li> my natural hair color is brown with some white in front at hairline.  I love how henna has turned my once broken hair, to strong hair that I can &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; and I have been able to grow it without it looking stringy.  I have used this particular brand twice, and have reordered it.  It does not cause the bright red as pictured, but, maybe it depends on the color your hair is before using the product.  I lim this brand though, so gave a five star.</li>
            <li> First of all, I bought this from a third party seller through Amazon, because I was intrigued by the deep orange color it promised to give; but the it arrived in my mailbox squished flat and the henna spilling all over the envelope. Because I haven&#x27;t seen this color being offered in too many other places and I&#x27;m willing to admit I haven&#x27;t done much searching, I was still willing to try it but I wanted to make sure that I would do it right especially since I was going to be using Henna for the first time and so I did some research online...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was intending to use this henna on my relaxed hair. After some research I was warned to be wary of commercially prepared \\&quot;compound\\&quot; hennas which should be avoided at all costs by people with relaxed hair like mine. This is because these compound hennas contain harmful metallic salts that will react with my chemical relaxer and cause my hair to essentially melt and break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I read the ingredients list it has all manner of stuff I can&#x27;t pronounce, even though the packaging claims \\&quot;100% chemical free\\&quot; of the front. Am I wrong to assume that pure henna, will only say henna in the ingredients list?&lt;br /&gt;Good thing I did research before hand! I shall be returning this promptly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought it through third party at $5.99, next day it was being sold by Amazon as an add on item at $3.95!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Henna to dye my hair since 1997 and have tried numerous brands/colors. I really liked this one. It mixed well and the color was very nice.</li>
            <li> REALLY LOVED THIS. IT SOFTENED MY HAIR</li>
            <li> Using my old shampoo bottle, I add about 1/4 cup of this plus water (I&#x27;ll try a little vinegar too, I read it helps hold the color), I washed my hair with it, combed out any clumps, let it dry and left it on. I did that about 5 times, now my hair is completely reddish, darkish brown, any grays if any, gone, gone, gone...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t shampoo my hair anymore, I just wash it with this and it makes my hair thicker, fuller, darker, I love, love, love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Now, my recipe works with me and my personality--I like easy, pretty, healthy, effortless... it took me about a year trying out different ways to use natural hair color so I&#x27;m ready when the time ever comes for grays, now I got it :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with my hair&#x27;s natural-looking copper colour and shine after using this product for the first time today. My (previously coloured) hair is naturally a straight, fine, dark auburn that falls just below my shoulder blades. I decided to try henna for the first time in a few years, after tiring of harsh regrowth lines from Clairol&#x27;s Nice &amp; Easy (110 Natural Light Auburn) and Garnier&#x27;s Olia (6.43 Light Natural Auburn) products. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. To combat henna&#x27;s &#x27;naturally earthy&#x27; smell and sometimes drying effect, I mixed one 50g package with hot water, 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, 1 tablespoon of coconut oil and 1/2 to 1 teaspoon each of cinnamon, cloves, ginger and vanilla essence which produced a smooth and creamy texture. Application was predictably messy (it&#x27;s almost like coating your hair with mud) and I left the solution on my hair for approx 70 minutes, after looping it into a high bun and donning the provided plastic shower cap. After washing, conditioning and blow-drying my hair it definitely smelled less &#x27;earthy&#x27; than with previous henna applications and turned out just the colour I hoped for. I recommend liberally applying moisturiser to the ears and hairline, using disposable latex gloves (not the plastic ones provided), wearing dark-coloured clothing during application, and quickly cleaning up any bathroom surface &#x27;spills&#x27; to avoid any unwanted stains. When I apply my final 50g package in a few weeks&#x27; time, I&#x27;ll try leaving it on for the recommended 90 to 120 minutes to compare the colour intensity. Given its reasonable price, I&#x27;ll buy this henna brand again for sure.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find out that this isn&#x27;t pure henna but a mix of different plants. However it still dyed my hair red but didn&#x27;t come out as bright as I wanted. This is not a bad product but not exactly what I was looking for. That is partly my fault for not reading the description carefully but the name of the produce misleading.  It&#x27;s simply not &amp;#34;pure herbal henna powder&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> this works great but it was more orange than the picture shows. its messy so just makesure you have towels covering everything</li>
            <li> This is the brand tey carry at my asian market. Its very messy but doesn&#x27;t have a horrible smell. Kinda like green tea. Its still on my hair so i&#x27;m not sure about the color. But I have longer than shoulder length hair and used only one bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair is very crunchy. I hope it loosens my curls.</li>
            <li> Love it. Great product!</li>
            <li> So this is my first Henna experience. The box comes with two large packages of powder and with my short hair half of one is more than enough. The first bag I used as described on the package on my hair and my son&#x27;s hair. I left his on for 2 hours and didn&#x27;t notice a change at all. I left mine on for 4 hours! And it was kind of red but nothing like the box! My natural hair is an ash blonde light brown. It did not last forever like others claimed and when I tried it the second time I googled other methods of henna and let it sit overnight with lemon juice and applied it. I let it sit for 2 hours and it did nothing. :( ... I still have half a bag left and I will probably use it just to finish it off but I won&#x27;t buy it again... I&#x27;ll find another one to try.</li>
            <li> The product is exactly what was expected, even better than other henna I have ever used (and I have been using henna for 7 years). very much appreciated</li>
            <li> Very good product and good price</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the color it leaves us way off.  Would not buy again left my natural red hair a funny color and continued to come off on everything for three weeks later!</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm.... I recommend using warm vinegar and lemon juice for better results</li>
            <li> While the color lasts, this made my hair very dry and the earthy smell lingers for quite some time. I won&#x27;t be using this brand again.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping I could get it to turn out lighter than the color on the box.  My hair is naturally dark blonde but I&#x27;ve been dyeing it red since I was 18 (22 years!)  I recently wanted to get away from the toxic chemicals and tried Olia but I didn&#x27;t really love the color choices they had for red so I got this and crossed my fingers.  I bought traditional Nice &#x27;N Easy platinum blonde to lighten my hair before using the henna (it turned out dark blonde).  I waited about 5 days after coloring with that before using the henna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I researched heavily and watched many YouTube videos on how to dye with henna and I called the manufacturer (number included in the box, very helpful!)  and asked the person who answered about possibly using chamomile tea and how to make the dye lighter.  He said that if I left the dye out overnight like some people suggested on the videos then the color would be much stronger, so I stuck with the directions included on the box.  I used about a cup of hot Sleepytime tea (it has chamomile in it) and used a little at a time, mixing it into a plastic bowl with both included packages of henna in this box until it was the consistency of ketchup, like it said.  I did NOT wait, I immediately started putting it on my hair which I had washed yesterday, wrapped it up on top of my head and covered it with the included plastic cap (not a great cap, it tore, but hey it&#x27;s included!) and waited the minimum time of 90 minutes.  I used sulfate-free conditioner after rinsing with warm water for a long time and it seems fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came out light like I wanted, a bit more orange than I had hoped but much lighter than the box.  I will try to include a photo of my hair color dyed this way if it lets me.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using herbal dye, and it worked out perfectly. I didn&#x27;t want to use just henna, because my skin has pink undertones, and I didn&#x27;t want to end up looking like Jigglypuff. This mixture has just the right amount of orange to balance out the red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been dying my hair red for years with chemical dyes, but I stripped it down to my natural dark blonde, so my roots wouldn&#x27;t end up three shades lighter than the rest of my hair. I mixed the power with lemon juice, let it sit overnight, then added chamomile tea and cinnamon the next day. I left the dye on for 3 hours, and it&#x27;s exactly the color I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product, but as with any herbal dye, make sure you do A TON of research beforehand. Once you go henna, you can&#x27;t go back.</li>
            <li> YOU GET THE COLOR ON THE BOX - IT WILL EVEN BE MORE OF AN INTENSE PINKY RED IF YOU&#x27;RE A BLONDE. I HIGHLY SUGGEST A STRAND TEST EACH AND EVERY TIME YOU USE HENNA - DIFFERENT HARVESTS RENDER DIFFERENT STRENGTHS... JUST PULL HAIR FROM A FULL HAIRBRUSH AND FASHION THE *TEST* STRAND FROM THAT WITH SCOTCH TAPE. YOU NEED TO SEE THE FINAL RESULTS PRIOR TO USING ANY HENNA PRODUCT. ALSO USE DISTILLED WATER ONLY FOR MIXING GROUND POWDER, GLOVES, AND PLASTIC AND WOODEN UTENSILS. PLAN ON AT LEAST 4 HOURS OF TIME. THIS IS NOT BOXED DRUGSTORE HAIRDYE. ITS A PLANT... :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used henna on my hair many times, and though this is a compound with other herbs, I gave it a try. Imagine my surprise when my hair turned out a light strawberry blonde! I figured it would just put a red tinge over my dark hair, but it really did lighten it, much to my surprise, but the red wasn&#x27;t nearly as intense as the picture. I&#x27;m switching back to the pure henna.</li>
            <li> I got this product for my mom and she loves it. Her hair are gray and it covored nicely with desired color.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product. I have tried for nearly 8 months to get a nice, natural looking orange color for my hair. I have tried nearly every brand that comes in a box at my local stores, to no prevail. They would either wash out completely after the initial rinsing, or they would already be faded the following day.  I tried using liquid cremes that you mix with developer, because they had been recommended to me by my friends, those also failed miserably. I have been dying my hair for years and I&#x27;ve never had a color that worked so horribly. After many failed attempts, I decided to go with the brand I use to be dedicated to, Manic Panic, to dye my hair a red color. This brand had worked every since time in the past, but it failed also. I ended up giving up and just leaving my hair the faded pink-ish color and dealt with it. Although, a lot of people said it looked nice, it wasn&#x27;t my intention, and I didn&#x27;t exactly like it. It was okay, since I didn&#x27;t want to waste anymore time dying it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I purchased this dye, It sat in my cupboard for a few weeks, because I was a little nervous to try it. Then, I finally decided to try it and it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used. The instructions are a little vague, but that&#x27;s okay. I read that you&#x27;re suppose to avoid metals with henna, so I mixed the dye in a kitchen mixing bowl. I mixed one box (two packets per box) with warm/hot water from the faucet. When it was mixed, the measuring cup had a total worth of 2 cups of dye. (I used all of it except for 1/2 cup) Boxed dyes usually require me to use 2 complete boxes to cover everything. It did take a extra amount of time mixing the dye up, because it requires it. The powder might ball up a little bit and you&#x27;ll need to break it t get the powder inside wet. Kind of like when you mix hot cocoa, but it takes a lot longer. My hair is sort of long, to my ribcage and one box was more than enough. I put the henna on and I noticed that it makes your hair rather stiff, but even though it&#x27;s a paste, it is still rather easily to apply. It might be easier as a two person job, but I&#x27;ve colored my hair enough to know when I have everything covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As mentioned in other reviews, it does have a earthy smell. To me, it smells like a mixture of cut grass, hay and paprika. I don&#x27;t have the best sense of smell, so it may be different to others, but I liked it. The paprika scent made me hungry for deviled eggs. Anyway, there will be a LOT of washout when you rinse it, but that&#x27;s okay. It will look like someone is pouring gallons of tea into your shower, but the color will still be in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is a beautiful, natural looking orange. I love it, it&#x27;s perfect. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like, is it looks so natural compared to my REAL natural eyebrow color of a dirty blonde. I wish my eyebrows were the same color, but I don&#x27;t want to dye my eyebrows, so I just color them with a little bit of orange eye-shadow and then people think that the orange is my real hair color! I&#x27;ve been told that my hair looks way healthier, and I agree. It&#x27;s not as frizzy as it use to be and with the natural looking highlights/low lights it looks as if this is how my hair is suppose to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never use any other type of dye for as long as I decide I want my hair to be orange. This is the color I&#x27;ve been trying to achieve and I am ecstatic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pictures aren&#x27;t the best, but I haven&#x27;t really had time to take a good one.&lt;br /&gt;My hair was a faded light orange-ish pink color when I dyed it.</li>
            <li> This is the only henna I will use now because It is l00% chemical free and last&#x27;s ridiculously long! It says on the box 4-6 weeks for the lasting ability and it is completely true. Don&#x27;t know why someone would ever do chemical coloring for red when it fades so fast! Just do Henna because it lasts just as long or even longer, and isn&#x27;t harmful to the hair or scalp. I&#x27;m also a cosmetologist, so believe me when I say compared to chemical coloring this stuff is amazing and can be used on women who are pregnant or unable to use harsh chemical coloring on there scalp.  Love this purchase!</li>
            <li> Right after I rinsed my hair, I was frustrated to see the yellow hue and brownish color - I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair a copper red for years and wanted to keep it that way. But as I dried my hair, it was like magic! It turned out to be the most natural copper color possible. It was much darker than I was expecting but it worked for me and I LOVE it. Much better than chemical colors for sure. My baby thin hair immediately got stronger and thicker.</li>
            <li> I have naturally red hair, light auburn, dark orange, ginger - whatever you might want to call it.  I wanted to find a color to cover grays and blend with my natural color. This may not be it. I left it on as long as they say to, and I&#x27;m sure it was too long. It made my hair VERY orange. Not exactly the look that I&#x27;m going for. I want it to still look natural. I have several different shades of Henna and I&#x27;m trying to figure out which one will match my hair the best. I haven&#x27;t seen any reviews from people who are trying to keep their red hair red, mostly just people with brown, black or blonde hair, looking to go red. So I have figured out, if your hair is already red, then you should not leave it on very long at all. Next time I use this one, I&#x27;m going to try washing it out as soon as I finish applying and see if that will work better for me.</li>
            <li> it smells really bad, but the colour is great!&lt;br /&gt;I am subscribed to get it every two months, and will continue to use. I love this product.</li>
            <li> It was horrible! It did NOT leave my hair feeling smooth at all! My hair did not feel damaged at all to begin with. I had recently cut it and it felt fine! However after using this product it left my hair feeling extremely dry the way horribly bleached hair feels. I had to cut the worst parts of my hair off that would not be able to recover with even the best hair treatments. Also note that while you have this gunk in your hair because it looks like GUNK, that it will smell horribly! It was very unpleasant to have to smell that for the time the gunk was in my hair but I was convinced that it would be worth it for the color in the end. It was NOT!!! It left a stench on my hair weeks after I applied it, after many washings!</li>
            <li> All natural and works great! I read online and mix mine differently than the direction on the box ( which is very vague) but after doing my research you can make your own concoctions using tea, oil, lemon and other additives so you can mix it however you want. I get lots of compliments on the color after I do it. I have quite a bit of grey and it covered it I was so pleased! I bought another color of this brand and mix the two together now.</li>
            <li> This is a fake product. It does not work at all. I would give 0 if possible.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!!!&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful full &amp; rich color, my hair is noticeably more healthy &amp; shiny now and I never have to use any gloss, serum or anti frizz products anymore!!&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is it&#x27;s time consuming; it has to stay in for a long time however, I have medium brown hair and I leave the henna in for at least 3 hours to get the right deep red color result.&lt;br /&gt;But the result it&#x27;s soooo worth the time!</li>
            <li> I had light blonde hair and it made my hair a pretty orange, doesn&#x27;t run or stain clothing afterwards. I&#x27;ve washed my hair a few times since and it is still vibrant. The mix is this nasty looking green mess that smells kinda bad though (reminded me of edamame), but, it works. At least isn&#x27;t harsh chemicals! It&#x27;s really cheap and comes with 2 bags, which was good for me, because I only needed one. I do recommend.</li>
