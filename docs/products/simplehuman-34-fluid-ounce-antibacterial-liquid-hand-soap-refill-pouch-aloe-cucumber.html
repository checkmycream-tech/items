            <li>Its nice to know that this is made for the automatic soap dispensers..</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my mother as a Chnristmas gift, she told me she liked it.  </li>
            <li>Nice product, I recommend.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled with my purchase from Amazon of a simplehuman sensor pump soap dispenser</li>
            <li>and I liked the consistency of the soap sample that came with it.</li>
            <li>Triclosan is NOT an effective antibacterial...</li>
            <li>REALLY&#x3D;&#x3D; IS EFFECTIVE</li>
            <li>When considering the quality of the soap&#x27;s ability to clean, the quantity of soap in each bag, how easy the soap is on skin, and how concentrated the soap is, this soap is an incredible buy.</li>
            <li>When considering the quality of the soap&#x27;s ability to clean, the quantity of soap in each bag, how easy the soap is on skin, and how concentrated the soap is, this soap is an incredible buy.</li>
            <li>Soap does not have a strong scent, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>They look nice sitting on my counter top and in the bath.  </li>
            <li>especially good for people with fragrance sensitive</li>
            <li>I love the Simplehuman dispenser and I was thrilled that I could have the soap refills mailed to me.</li>
            <li>The cucumber and aloe soap has a pleasant light sent which I love.  </li>
            <li>Great product with very reasonable pricing though.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent of this soap.</li>
            <li>and I love how it smells</li>
            <li>We love it.</li>
            <li>I sure hope they keep making this product</li>
            <li>and I love how it moisturizes my hands every time I wash.</li>
            <li>With 5 dollar coupon and buy 3 for a couple of dollars more than the one.</li>
            <li>Dawn works okay in the kitchen, but you may not want to use it in bathrooms.  </li>
            <li>This keeps the dispenser running smoothly and leaves your hands moisturized an with a nice lavender scent.</li>
            <li>It had a lovely lavender fragrance</li>
            <li>I used triclosan soaps for many years before learning of its ineffectiveness and risks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like lemon-scented pine-sol, diluted with a bit of pine-scented pine-sol.  </li>
            <li>Glad to see that Amazon carries it.</li>
            <li>I liked the easy to pour spout, and the nice clean fragrance.</li>
            <li>so I did my best to clean the dispenser and run clear water through it.</li>
            <li>As many great Reviews have already discussed the soap itself, my review is going to concentrate more on the active ingredient in this product, and why I feel it makes this soap superior to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this soap and the easy to use bag</li>
            <li>I love my hands free soap dispenser and this this my favorite soap for it.  </li>
            <li>They have fantastic high quality products at great prices.</li>
            <li>There are more brands of hand soap on the market that one has to use a dictionary with a huge memory to find them but why bother when there is Simplehuman Liquid Hand Soap.  </li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t offer the scents I am familiar with and it also takes more soap to lather up.</li>
            <li>but when I finally gave in and decided that the best way to prolong the life of my sensor pump was to use simplehuman&#x27;s liquid soap, I chose the antibacterial soap which has a light pleasantly sweet fragrance.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s antibacterial and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is a nice and light (fresh) scent.  </li>
            <li>When considering the premium quality &amp; performance of this soap, this is one of the most affordable soaps on the market of its type, and overall a great value.</li>
            <li>It stores easily and</li>
            <li>the spout is stable and easy to pour with.  </li>
            <li>The smell was not too strong.</li>
            <li>a maker decides to produce an antibacterial soap and chooses to use an antimicrobial that is REALLY effective, they deserve credit; that is exactly the case here.</li>
            <li>Product is fine.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is quiet and peaceful (saw that in a book) but very pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Triclosan is arguably the snake oil of antimicrobials, and it makes up a huge portion of soaps sold as &amp;#34;antibacterial&amp;#34; because it is cheap to produce.</li>
            <li>I like being able to squeeze all the liquid out of a refill and most bottles are a pain to deal with -- the fact that this is a &amp;#34;pouch&amp;#34; instead of a bottle makes the task much easier.</li>
            <li>I have loved this soap for years which I have read is naturally antibacterial.</li>
            <li>Its super easy to use and smells so clean.</li>
            <li>They can be thinned with water, but don&#x27;t clean as well as this,</li>
            <li>using any antimicrobial scrub or product, correct usage is the key to safe and effective usage.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t need it overnight - read &#x27;free shipping&#x27; on most items - it&#x27;s, generally, sold here at a better price.  </li>
            <li>We love this it is so easy to use and love that it has different settings for the amount of soap the comes out.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s specially formulated to work well</li>
            <li>Great product and worth a few pennies more.</li>
            <li>Despite being an antibacterial soap, this soap has good cleaning power to help physically remove dirt/grime from hands.</li>
            <li>This ability to effectively clean AND effectively disinfect makes this soap very versatile and a great choice for daily, general usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INEFFECTIVE</li>
            <li>This is one of the best antibacterial hand soaps on the market, and one of the few home-use soaps that contain an active ingredient that is unquestionably effective against harmful pathogens.</li>
            <li>So many hand soaps leave my skin dried out, but this smells and feels amazing.</li>
            <li>This was purchased for a hands free soap dispenser,  It was received very promptly and was a generous sized package.</li>
            <li>The Simplehuman Dispenser requires soap of a distinct viscosity and so purchased this item.</li>
            <li>And, I neither work for them, have a relative on their payroll, nor, receive any kind of kick-back for any of my reviews (see---a lot).  </li>
            <li>We prefer the extremely popular antibacterial soap, especially during flu season.</li>
            <li>It is effective in killing resistant pathogens such as MRSA.</li>
            <li>AND IT&#x27;S WORTH EVERY PENNY</li>
            <li>If you want to use a daily soap that can serve as an effective antimicrobial, this is the soap for you.</li>
            <li>AND IT&#x27;S WORTH EVERY PENNY</li>
            <li>If you want to use a daily soap that can serve as an effective antimicrobial, this is the soap for you.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>They seem to be popular so being in stock can be the only downfall</li>
            <li>It was just right.</li>
            <li>THIS SOAP RIGHT,</li>
            <li>THIS SOAP RIGHT,</li>
            <li>The soap is the right thickness for the dispenser.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hands soft and moisturized -- and clean!</li>
            <li>I prefer the lavendar scent as it smells better and provides better lathering up with less soap.</li>
            <li>Apparently this soap is thinner than most liquid soap and the dispenser has an easier time dispensing it.  </li>
            <li>It is effective at cleaning hands and above all leaving the hands moisturized sufficiently well that I do not have to add more later.  </li>
            <li>The gels don&#x27;t dispense very well, so am glad that simplehuman offers a recommended liquid soap that is antibacterial.</li>
            <li>Simple human are a great brand.</li>
            <li>I love the refill soap, it is the only soap that does not clog up the dispenser, it is a bit pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>soap is just right, it is in between being too thick and being too watery and works great with the Simplehuman dispenser and any plastic bottle.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, if someone wants to research a bunch of cheaper soaps in an effort to find one that is as thin and yet effective (perfect amount of suds) as simplehuman&#x27;s liquid soaps, sign me up.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, if someone wants to research a bunch of cheaper soaps in an effort to find one that is as thin and yet effective (perfect amount of suds) as simplehuman&#x27;s liquid soaps, sign me up.</li>
            <li>Many liquid soaps clog the pump and won&#x27;t dispense properly.</li>
            <li>but like so many of these products some are short lived.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s finally on</li>
            <li>A bit too watery, would have rated higher if the product was thicker.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought the cucumber melon scent as I have enjoyed the scent in other products.</li>
            <li>I do notice that we have to use a higher setting on the sensor</li>
            <li>Simple Human did not have to do this, but they chose to anyway, and that makes this a superior product.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance in it and it is relatively gentle on the hands.</li>
            <li>I know, too much grease,</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>I think she really did</li>
            <li>Everyone buys it up fast.</li>
            <li>use this mainly with the smaller Simple Human dispenser and it works great.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s so many other brands in the market, non compares to this</li>
            <li>im sure she will bye this one or the other moisturizing soap refill..</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the smell as much as I do the lavender, but it&#x27;s still high quality</li>
            <li>This is our first time purchasing from Amazon - we bought our first 2 Simplehuman liquid soap dispenser about a year ago and two bags seem to be enough for the whole year.</li>
            <li>I guess Simple human does not give much leeway on sellers to be able to sell it cheaper.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I call it extremely popular because it is hard to find in stock.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.sufficient time to work, and this can potentially contribute to the increasing issue of resistant pathogens (for that sort of super-quick hand wash without a set time, I use a soap without an antimicrobial.)</li>
            <li>Spout makes it easy to refill the simple human automatic soap dispensers.</li>
            <li>It makes filling the simple human soap dispenser so easy.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Internet shopping, especially at Amazon, has really spoiled me.  </li>
            <li>I have read reviews where people have complained about not being able to shut off the device when cleaning it or moving it</li>
            <li>Simple human has it right.</li>
            <li>Simple Human did antibacterial soap the right way.</li>
            <li>Simple Human did antibacterial soap the right way.</li>
            <li>All antimicrobials have a &amp;#34;set time&amp;#34;, which is more or less how long the antimicrobial needs to make contact with a surface to work to a said degree</li>
            <li>In other words, the active ingredient in this Simple Human soap is extremely effective, in a world where the large majority of soaps sold as &amp;#34;antibacterial&amp;#34; are ineffective.</li>
            <li>My hands never feel dried out after using it and it is specially formulated to work in my motion sensing dispenser.  </li>
            <li>Priced it locally with FL state tax, and, then, found it at my trusty Amazon website for substantially less, with free shipping.  </li>
            <li>And despite the countless research studies that have demonstrated triclosan as completely ineffective as an antibacterial agent in soap, many companies continue to use triclosan and label triclosan-based soaps as &amp;#34;antibacterial.&amp;#34; I feel that is unfair to consumers and somewhat ethically</li>
            <li>So while benzalkonium chloride is generally fast-acting, it should still be given sufficient time to work.</li>
            <li>So while benzalkonium chloride is generally fast-acting, it should still be given sufficient time to work.</li>
            <li>a general rule, soaps with effective antimicrobials are expensive.</li>
            <li>a general rule, soaps with effective antimicrobials are expensive.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing that compares to this brand, I highly recommend, since it doesn&#x27;t dry your hands.</li>
            <li>The other scent (lavendar) was just a little too strong for me.  </li>
            <li>With this product I generally allow a set time of around 30-45 seconds once the lather has been made and hands are entirely</li>

            <li>The smell is rather mild, the soap is easy-going on hands, it does not leave any residue, and it is concentrated enough that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>lathers some but not too much to make a mess.</li>

            <li> I love the Simplehuman dispenser and I was thrilled that I could have the soap refills mailed to me.</li>
            <li> The cucumber and aloe soap has a pleasant light sent which I love.  </li>
            <li> Great product with very reasonable pricing though.  </li>
            <li> I love the scent of this soap.</li>
            <li> and I love how it smells</li>
            <li> We love it.</li>
            <li> I sure hope they keep making this product</li>
            <li> and I love how it moisturizes my hands every time I wash.</li>
            <li> With 5 dollar coupon and buy 3 for a couple of dollars more than the one.</li>
            <li> Dawn works okay in the kitchen, but you may not want to use it in bathrooms.  </li>
            <li> This keeps the dispenser running smoothly and leaves your hands moisturized an with a nice lavender scent.</li>
            <li> It had a lovely lavender fragrance</li>
            <li> I used triclosan soaps for many years before learning of its ineffectiveness and risks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like lemon-scented pine-sol, diluted with a bit of pine-scented pine-sol.  </li>
            <li> Glad to see that Amazon carries it.</li>
            <li> I liked the easy to pour spout, and the nice clean fragrance.</li>
            <li> so I did my best to clean the dispenser and run clear water through it.</li>
            <li> As many great Reviews have already discussed the soap itself, my review is going to concentrate more on the active ingredient in this product, and why I feel it makes this soap superior to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this soap and the easy to use bag</li>
            <li> I love my hands free soap dispenser and this this my favorite soap for it.  </li>
            <li> They have fantastic high quality products at great prices.</li>
            <li> There are more brands of hand soap on the market that one has to use a dictionary with a huge memory to find them but why bother when there is Simplehuman Liquid Hand Soap.  </li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t offer the scents I am familiar with and it also takes more soap to lather up.</li>
            <li> but when I finally gave in and decided that the best way to prolong the life of my sensor pump was to use simplehuman&#x27;s liquid soap, I chose the antibacterial soap which has a light pleasantly sweet fragrance.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s antibacterial and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is a nice and light (fresh) scent.  </li>
            <li> When considering the premium quality &amp; performance of this soap, this is one of the most affordable soaps on the market of its type, and overall a great value.</li>
            <li> It stores easily and</li>
            <li> the spout is stable and easy to pour with.  </li>
            <li> The smell was not too strong.</li>
            <li> a maker decides to produce an antibacterial soap and chooses to use an antimicrobial that is REALLY effective, they deserve credit; that is exactly the case here.</li>
            <li> Product is fine.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is quiet and peaceful (saw that in a book) but very pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Triclosan is arguably the snake oil of antimicrobials, and it makes up a huge portion of soaps sold as &amp;#34;antibacterial&amp;#34; because it is cheap to produce.</li>
            <li> I like being able to squeeze all the liquid out of a refill and most bottles are a pain to deal with -- the fact that this is a &amp;#34;pouch&amp;#34; instead of a bottle makes the task much easier.</li>
            <li> I have loved this soap for years which I have read is naturally antibacterial.</li>
            <li> Its super easy to use and smells so clean.</li>
            <li> They can be thinned with water, but don&#x27;t clean as well as this,</li>
            <li> using any antimicrobial scrub or product, correct usage is the key to safe and effective usage.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t need it overnight - read &#x27;free shipping&#x27; on most items - it&#x27;s, generally, sold here at a better price.  </li>
            <li> We love this it is so easy to use and love that it has different settings for the amount of soap the comes out.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s specially formulated to work well</li>
            <li> Great product and worth a few pennies more.</li>
            <li> Despite being an antibacterial soap, this soap has good cleaning power to help physically remove dirt/grime from hands.</li>
            <li> This ability to effectively clean AND effectively disinfect makes this soap very versatile and a great choice for daily, general usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INEFFECTIVE</li>
            <li> This is one of the best antibacterial hand soaps on the market, and one of the few home-use soaps that contain an active ingredient that is unquestionably effective against harmful pathogens.</li>
            <li> So many hand soaps leave my skin dried out, but this smells and feels amazing.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for a hands free soap dispenser,  It was received very promptly and was a generous sized package.</li>
            <li> The Simplehuman Dispenser requires soap of a distinct viscosity and so purchased this item.</li>
            <li> And, I neither work for them, have a relative on their payroll, nor, receive any kind of kick-back for any of my reviews (see---a lot).  </li>
            <li> We prefer the extremely popular antibacterial soap, especially during flu season.</li>
            <li> It is effective in killing resistant pathogens such as MRSA.</li>
            <li> AND IT&#x27;S WORTH EVERY PENNY</li>
            <li> If you want to use a daily soap that can serve as an effective antimicrobial, this is the soap for you.</li>
            <li> AND IT&#x27;S WORTH EVERY PENNY</li>
            <li> If you want to use a daily soap that can serve as an effective antimicrobial, this is the soap for you.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> They seem to be popular so being in stock can be the only downfall</li>
            <li> It was just right.</li>
            <li> THIS SOAP RIGHT,</li>
            <li> THIS SOAP RIGHT,</li>
            <li> The soap is the right thickness for the dispenser.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hands soft and moisturized -- and clean!</li>
            <li> I prefer the lavendar scent as it smells better and provides better lathering up with less soap.</li>
            <li> Apparently this soap is thinner than most liquid soap and the dispenser has an easier time dispensing it.  </li>
            <li> It is effective at cleaning hands and above all leaving the hands moisturized sufficiently well that I do not have to add more later.  </li>
            <li> The gels don&#x27;t dispense very well, so am glad that simplehuman offers a recommended liquid soap that is antibacterial.</li>
            <li> Simple human are a great brand.</li>
            <li> I love the refill soap, it is the only soap that does not clog up the dispenser, it is a bit pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> soap is just right, it is in between being too thick and being too watery and works great with the Simplehuman dispenser and any plastic bottle.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, if someone wants to research a bunch of cheaper soaps in an effort to find one that is as thin and yet effective (perfect amount of suds) as simplehuman&#x27;s liquid soaps, sign me up.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, if someone wants to research a bunch of cheaper soaps in an effort to find one that is as thin and yet effective (perfect amount of suds) as simplehuman&#x27;s liquid soaps, sign me up.</li>
            <li> Many liquid soaps clog the pump and won&#x27;t dispense properly.</li>
            <li> but like so many of these products some are short lived.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s finally on</li>
            <li> A bit too watery, would have rated higher if the product was thicker.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought the cucumber melon scent as I have enjoyed the scent in other products.</li>
            <li> I do notice that we have to use a higher setting on the sensor</li>
            <li> Simple Human did not have to do this, but they chose to anyway, and that makes this a superior product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance in it and it is relatively gentle on the hands.</li>
            <li> I know, too much grease,</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I think she really did</li>
            <li> Everyone buys it up fast.</li>
            <li> use this mainly with the smaller Simple Human dispenser and it works great.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s so many other brands in the market, non compares to this</li>
            <li> im sure she will bye this one or the other moisturizing soap refill..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell as much as I do the lavender, but it&#x27;s still high quality</li>
            <li> This is our first time purchasing from Amazon - we bought our first 2 Simplehuman liquid soap dispenser about a year ago and two bags seem to be enough for the whole year.</li>
            <li> I guess Simple human does not give much leeway on sellers to be able to sell it cheaper.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I call it extremely popular because it is hard to find in stock.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny.sufficient time to work, and this can potentially contribute to the increasing issue of resistant pathogens (for that sort of super-quick hand wash without a set time, I use a soap without an antimicrobial.)</li>
            <li> Spout makes it easy to refill the simple human automatic soap dispensers.</li>
            <li> It makes filling the simple human soap dispenser so easy.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Internet shopping, especially at Amazon, has really spoiled me.  </li>
            <li> I have read reviews where people have complained about not being able to shut off the device when cleaning it or moving it</li>
            <li> Simple human has it right.</li>
            <li> Simple Human did antibacterial soap the right way.</li>
            <li> Simple Human did antibacterial soap the right way.</li>
            <li> All antimicrobials have a &amp;#34;set time&amp;#34;, which is more or less how long the antimicrobial needs to make contact with a surface to work to a said degree</li>
            <li> In other words, the active ingredient in this Simple Human soap is extremely effective, in a world where the large majority of soaps sold as &amp;#34;antibacterial&amp;#34; are ineffective.</li>
            <li> My hands never feel dried out after using it and it is specially formulated to work in my motion sensing dispenser.  </li>
            <li> Priced it locally with FL state tax, and, then, found it at my trusty Amazon website for substantially less, with free shipping.  </li>
            <li> And despite the countless research studies that have demonstrated triclosan as completely ineffective as an antibacterial agent in soap, many companies continue to use triclosan and label triclosan-based soaps as &amp;#34;antibacterial.&amp;#34; I feel that is unfair to consumers and somewhat ethically</li>
            <li> So while benzalkonium chloride is generally fast-acting, it should still be given sufficient time to work.</li>
            <li> So while benzalkonium chloride is generally fast-acting, it should still be given sufficient time to work.</li>
            <li> a general rule, soaps with effective antimicrobials are expensive.</li>
            <li> a general rule, soaps with effective antimicrobials are expensive.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing that compares to this brand, I highly recommend, since it doesn&#x27;t dry your hands.</li>
            <li> The other scent (lavendar) was just a little too strong for me.  </li>
            <li> With this product I generally allow a set time of around 30-45 seconds once the lather has been made and hands are entirely</li>
            <li> With this product I generally allow a set time of around 30-45 seconds once the lather has been made and hands are entirely</li>
            <li> The smell is rather mild, the soap is easy-going on hands, it does not leave any residue, and it is concentrated enough that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> lathers some but not too much to make a mess.</li>
            <li> Even worse is that research indicates long-term exposure to triclosan may be harmful and that it may be contributing to antibiotic resistance more than other products.</li>
            <li> I use to have to replace my dispenser frequently with the other soaps I would use.</li>
            <li> Not too long ago I would not have even considered Simplehiman; however, after buying several of their products I am a died in the wool fan of everything of theirs that I have used and this soap is no exception.  </li>
            <li> found this to be flat in the scent area and does not lather at all.  </li>
            <li> lasted me approximately four months (with one full load waisted by my daughter who was &amp;#34;playing&amp;#34; with the soap).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, it is more expensive than soft-soap or any other liquid soaps out there</li>
            <li> Soap dispenser broke long before I could use the additional soap.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say if my hands are any softer or not since I&#x27;m constantly washing my hands anyway due to my occupation.</li>
            <li> Perhaps earlier models were different but with our model all you have to do is hold down the minus button for about 8 seconds and when you want to turn it on you just tap the plus button one tap at a time, testing it along the way to see when you have achieved the amount of soap you like.</li>
            <li> if their only active ingredient is triclosan.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased a few of these refill pouches and they seem to las a long time.  </li>
            <li> The soap has a slight sanitary odor, and no perfume, but compared to similar antibacterial soaps, it is dilute (needs 2 pumps for handwash, compared to the customary 1)</li>
            <li> My feeling is that I spent a bunch of money on this soap dispenser which was a luxury for me.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s also not uncommon for it to slightly change the scent of a soaps, although the change is usually pretty</li>
            <li> I chose to use this soap due to the reviews on the Simplehuman automated soap dispenser.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used other types in my auto dispenser, tho</li>
            <li> Liquid hand soaps purchased from other sources may plug the dispenser.</li>
            <li> Having purchased two SimpleHuman soap dispensers in the past year, I only use this soap with it.</li>
            <li> I got this 3 months ago, and only now opened it after going through the small bag that came with the dispenser.</li>
            <li> It is extremely runny, like water almost.</li>
            <li> Simplehuman&#x27;s liquid soaps are probably on a par with other quality soaps on price</li>
            <li> Some of the other liquid soaps are just to thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> other reviews, I have criticized soaps &amp; cleaning products (and their makers) that are labeled as &amp;#34;antibacterial&amp;#34; and use triclosan as the active ingredient.</li>
            <li> Skip the cheaper products that contain ineffective active ingredients and go for this.</li>
            <li> Skip the cheaper products that contain ineffective active ingredients and go for this.</li>
            <li> The Dish-washing liquid is average.</li>
            <li> This soap was watered down, would not lather.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to run it down prematurely by using a soap that will clog it up.</li>
            <li> However can be bought at Bath Bed and Beyond for half the price without a coupon.</li>
            <li> However, there is a hidden price and a lot of misinformation regarding its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> (Side Note -- benzalkonium chloride is an eye irritant and so this is obviously not a good facial scrub...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> I used to use dial and have to dilute it with water to thin it out enough to not clog the pump..</li>
            <li> This Simple Human soap is one of the least expensive antibacterial soaps on the market.</li>
            <li> This Simple Human soap is one of the least expensive antibacterial soaps on the market.</li>
            <li> Really dried out my skin...</li>
            <li> This soap is ok, like all SimpleHuman soaps, except that it has a sickening smell, not at all</li>
            <li> I give 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t seem as caustic as the low cost refills I&#x27;ve bought before.</li>
            <li> Beyond being ineffective against bacteria, it does absolutely nothing against other pathogens that make us sick.</li>
            <li> This at times is less expensive, at times only.</li>
            <li> I tried watering it down but that seemed to make it worse.</li>
            <li> I learned the hard way this is not the soap that comes with simplehuman soap dispensers.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is sometimes hard to find nowadays</li>
            <li> Bag will fill dispenser at least 2x.  </li>
            <li> I have another review on another liquid soap that is extremely critical owing to it&#x27;s failure to my disappointment at the lack of bubbles and soapiness.  </li>
            <li> This one is very runny and is a very ugly greenish color.  </li>
            <li> However, it is VERY thick.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it yet because both of the Simplehuman automatic dispensers failed with the sample included with purchase.</li>
            <li> How can you get it wrong</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when I received the sensor pump I had a number of bottles of Jason&#x27;s Tea Tree Oil Satin Soap.</li>
            <li> This smelled very unpleasant.</li>
            <li> This soap smells terrible!</li>
            <li> Buy soap elsewhere, this is a terrible product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This was purchased for a gift.  I haven&#x27;t personally used it.</li>
            <li> Great price for this product. The smell was not too strong. I had to wait for restocking but came just when needed.</li>
            <li> I love my hands free soap dispenser and this this my favorite soap for it.  I love the scent of this soap.</li>
            <li> This soap smells terrible! Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a foam dispenser in the kitchen but purchased the sensor dispenser by simplehuman and LOVE LOVE LOVE our dispenser and this soap is perfect for it! it&#x27;s specially formulated to work well and I love how it smells, feels and makes my hands feel.  If you have a sensor soap pump, you need to get any of the different formulas by simplehuman.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it yet because both of the Simplehuman automatic dispensers failed with the sample included with purchase. I will assume soap is soap and will eventually use it, but the dispenser is unreliable.</li>
            <li> Leaves a lotion-like residue/sensation on your hands.  Not what I was hoping for in a soap.</li>
            <li> arrived on time.  This is the best soap and dispenser.  We love it.</li>
            <li> This soap was watered down, would not lather. Stranger, never had a problem with the moisturizing one.</li>
            <li> Soap dispenser broke long before I could use the additional soap. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> This is our first time purchasing from Amazon - we bought our first 2 Simplehuman liquid soap dispenser about a year ago and two bags seem to be enough for the whole year. Yes, it is more expensive than soft-soap or any other liquid soaps out there but the Simplehuman does ration what you need. Soap works and suds up nicely. Can&#x27;t say if my hands are any softer or not since I&#x27;m constantly washing my hands anyway due to my occupation.</li>
            <li> I really liked the product because achievement fulfill all that was needed.&lt;br /&gt;Fulfilled with my expectations completely.&lt;br /&gt;Would consider buying again.</li>
            <li> I chose to use this soap due to the reviews on the Simplehuman automated soap dispenser.  Apparently this soap is thinner than most liquid soap and the dispenser has an easier time dispensing it.  The soap is nice, smells good and lathers well.  I actually purchased a few of these refill pouches and they seem to las a long time.  I have two dispensers, on in my kitchen and one in my downstairs bathroom.  We have a family of five and three refills lasted me approximately four months (with one full load waisted by my daughter who was &amp;#34;playing&amp;#34; with the soap).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great soap, works well in the Simplehuman soap dispenser.</li>
            <li> This smelled very unpleasant.</li>
            <li> A bit pricy, but great in electric dispenser. Many liquid soaps clog the pump and won&#x27;t dispense properly. They can be thinned with water, but don&#x27;t clean as well as this,</li>
            <li> Good soap but wish it was a bit cheaper.  Haven&#x27;t used other types in my auto dispenser, tho they say you can.  I use disinfectant in Kitchen and regular lavender in bathrooms</li>
            <li> Its soap...How can you get it wrong lol...Nice product.</li>
            <li> I learned the hard way this is not the soap that comes with simplehuman soap dispensers.  This one is very runny and is a very ugly greenish color.  It also dries out your hands if you use it often.  The simplehuman moisturizing liquid hand soap (lavender) is much better!</li>
            <li> I have another review on another liquid soap that is extremely critical owing to it&#x27;s failure to my disappointment at the lack of bubbles and soapiness.  I actually can not remember the trade name but do not want to confuse anyone.  Simplehuman products do their promised job.</li>
            <li> Awesome! My husband uses this a lot and has had no issues. I also find that it is not drying out my skin.</li>
            <li> This hand soap is made specifically to go in the Simplehuman automatic soap dispensers, so it&#x27;s the correct consistency and doesn&#x27;t block up the dispenser.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing that compares to this brand, I highly recommend, since it doesn&#x27;t dry your hands. There&#x27;s so many other brands in the market, non compares to this</li>
            <li> There are more brands of hand soap on the market that one has to use a dictionary with a huge memory to find them but why bother when there is Simplehuman Liquid Hand Soap.  Not too long ago I would not have even considered Simplehiman; however, after buying several of their products I am a died in the wool fan of everything of theirs that I have used and this soap is no exception.  It is effective at cleaning hands and above all leaving the hands moisturized sufficiently well that I do not have to add more later.  The fragrance is quiet and peaceful (saw that in a book) but very pleasant.  I sure hope they keep making this product but like so many of these products some are short lived.  Great product and worth a few pennies more.</li>
            <li> Ths item was packaged well and shipped promptly.  The Simplehuman Dispenser requires soap of a distinct viscosity and so purchased this item. Liquid hand soaps purchased from other sources may plug the dispenser.</li>
            <li> I did not expect the nice aroma from this soap to permeate my powder room. What a nice surprise, and very nice soap on the hands.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell as much as I do the lavender, but it&#x27;s still high quality and I love how it moisturizes my hands every time I wash.</li>
            <li> Compact, well packaged, works like a charm. Good purchase.</li>
            <li> As advertised. Very good product.</li>
            <li> Having purchased two SimpleHuman soap dispensers in the past year, I only use this soap with it. The viscosity is perfect for the battery powered dispenser. Doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance in it and it is relatively gentle on the hands.</li>
            <li> This soap smells great and leaves your hands feeling clean.&lt;br /&gt;First found this at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and bought it with the Automatic Soap Dispenser and have used it since.&lt;br /&gt;It is sometimes hard to find nowadays so I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s finally on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The soap is just right, it is in between being too thick and being too watery and works great with the Simplehuman dispenser and any plastic bottle.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my simplehuma sensor soap dispenser.</li>
            <li> Good product by a great company.However can be bought at Bath Bed and Beyond for half the price without a coupon.With 5 dollar coupon and buy 3 for a couple of dollars more than the one. Thats why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Love my Superhuman soap dispenser and the price on the refill through Amazon is a great deal</li>
            <li> great buy if you use lots of soap like me</li>
            <li> Excellent product. We recommend</li>
            <li> Some liquid soaps congeal in the dispenser, expecially if it is not used several times a day.  Dawn works okay in the kitchen, but you may not want to use it in bathrooms.  This Simplehuman soap keeps the dispensers working reliably.</li>
            <li> I am totally hooked on Simplehuman soaps and soap decanters.  They look nice sitting on my counter top and in the bath.  The soap is GOOD and concentrated and I feel that it is better for me and the environment.  It is all that I use in liquid handsoap now.</li>
            <li> Ordered this to use in my simplehuman  sensor soap pump as it is not a gel. The gels don&#x27;t dispense very well, so am glad that simplehuman offers a recommended liquid soap that is antibacterial.</li>
            <li> A bit too watery, would have rated higher if the product was thicker.  Works well with the automatic dispenser.  Good price.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s antibacterial and easy to use. This would&lt;br /&gt;be especially good for people with fragrance sensitive noses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish they made&lt;br /&gt;the lemon dish soap a hand soap and anitbacterial.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly in hands-free dispenser.  Bag will fill dispenser at least 2x.  Soap does not have a strong scent, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> found this to be flat in the scent area and does not lather at all.  will not get this one again.</li>
            <li> I tried using Dawn in the simplehuman dispenser and it clogged the nozzle to the point where I had to replace it.</li>
            <li> We received the soap dispenser as a Xmas gift, and, eventually, ran out of soap.  Priced it locally with FL state tax, and, then, found it at my trusty Amazon website for substantially less, with free shipping.  Internet shopping, especially at Amazon, has really spoiled me.  It has been my experience, and, I have purchased a number of items here, that you can&#x27;t beat the quality and pricing of Amazon.  And, I neither work for them, have a relative on their payroll, nor, receive any kind of kick-back for any of my reviews (see---a lot).  If you don&#x27;t need it overnight - read &#x27;free shipping&#x27; on most items - it&#x27;s, generally, sold here at a better price.  I know, too much grease, but, I have saved a ton of dough shopping here, and, they have my respect - as well as a lot of my money.</li>
            <li> I refill my touch free soap dispenser and the soap is perfect for my daycare kids. lathers some but not too much to make a mess.</li>
            <li> Its nice to know that this is made for the automatic soap dispensers.. I used to use dial and have to dilute it with water to thin it out enough to not clog the pump.. this stuff doesn&#x27;t need to be diluted as it is made for the automatic pumps.. a bit overpriced for soap maybe.</li>
            <li> I got this 3 months ago, and only now opened it after going through the small bag that came with the dispenser. It is extremely runny, like water almost. Buy soap elsewhere, this is a terrible product.</li>
            <li> I have used this soap since Simple Human recommended it. I use to have to replace my dispenser frequently with the other soaps I would use. This keeps the dispenser running smoothly and leaves your hands moisturized an with a nice lavender scent. The Dish-washing liquid is average. I prefer using another brand, therefore I will not purchase it anymore. The price is reasonable. I guess Simple human does not give much leeway on sellers to be able to sell it cheaper. The price runs about the same everywhere . I will not mention the store, but they are always sending 20% Coupons. This at times is less expensive, at times only.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my mother as a Chnristmas gift, she told me she liked it.  I think she really did</li>
            <li> We stumbled onto Simplehuman products last year, and what a treasure we found. They have fantastic high quality products at great prices. Their hand soaps are the best. We prefer the extremely popular antibacterial soap, especially during flu season. I call it extremely popular because it is hard to find in stock. Everyone buys it up fast. I order extras when i can catch it in stock. We have their touchless hand pumps. Very nice items. Check out their website for all the neat  home products they sell. Very innovative company. [...]</li>
            <li> This is a nice and light (fresh) scent.  The soap feels nice and lathers perfectly and then rinses off easily making my hands feel nice and smooth.  I purchased 4 of them to save on shipping costs.  I&#x27;m in a two person household with 1 germ-a-phobe hand washer and one 32-ounce contaner has lasted several weeks.  I highly recommend this product.  The other scent (lavendar) was just a little too strong for me.  This scent was perfection.  It was just right.</li>
            <li> Received on time. Nice product, I recommend.</li>
            <li> Product is fine. I like being able to squeeze all the liquid out of a refill and most bottles are a pain to deal with -- the fact that this is a &amp;#34;pouch&amp;#34; instead of a bottle makes the task much easier.</li>
            <li> Great soap, great value.  Spout makes it easy to refill the simple human automatic soap dispensers.</li>
            <li> I originally bought the cucumber melon scent as I have enjoyed the scent in other products. This product doesn&#x27;t offer the scents I am familiar with and it also takes more soap to lather up. I prefer the lavendar scent as it smells better and provides better lathering up with less soap.</li>
            <li> We love this it is so easy to use and love that it has different settings for the amount of soap the comes out. the soap is great love it.</li>
            <li> Works great in automatic soap dispenser. Feels good. Leaves no residue on hands.</li>
            <li> Great soap for their dispenser. Smells nice and a little goes a long way. Simple human has it right.</li>
            <li> very good product, perfect for what I needed it for.  Arrived on time.  Just as described. I will order this product again when deeded.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled with my purchase from Amazon of a simplehuman sensor pump soap dispenser and I liked the consistency of the soap sample that came with it. It had a lovely lavender fragrance but when I finally gave in and decided that the best way to prolong the life of my sensor pump was to use simplehuman&#x27;s liquid soap, I chose the antibacterial soap which has a light pleasantly sweet fragrance. Unfortunately, when I received the sensor pump I had a number of bottles of Jason&#x27;s Tea Tree Oil Satin Soap. I have loved this soap for years which I have read is naturally antibacterial. However, it is VERY thick. As soon as I put it in my sensor pump I knew it was a mistake. I tried watering it down but that seemed to make it worse. I knew that this soap would literally gum up the works so I did my best to clean the dispenser and run clear water through it. I do notice that we have to use a higher setting on the sensor pump to get the same amount of soap we had before my experiment. I have read reviews where people have complained about not being able to shut off the device when cleaning it or moving it so it spurts soap everywhere. Perhaps earlier models were different but with our model all you have to do is hold down the minus button for about 8 seconds and when you want to turn it on you just tap the plus button one tap at a time, testing it along the way to see when you have achieved the amount of soap you like. I used to like only one plus tap and now I need two or three taps. Simplehuman&#x27;s liquid soaps are probably on a par with other quality soaps on price but there are definitely cheaper soaps out there. My feeling is that I spent a bunch of money on this soap dispenser which was a luxury for me. I don&#x27;t want to run it down prematurely by using a soap that will clog it up. I have noticed that cheaper soaps tend to be thicker as if consumers will equate thickness with quality and it is this thickness which I believe will be detrimental to the sensor pump mechanism. On the other hand, if someone wants to research a bunch of cheaper soaps in an effort to find one that is as thin and yet effective (perfect amount of suds) as simplehuman&#x27;s liquid soaps, sign me up.On the other hand, if someone wants to research a bunch of cheaper soaps in an effort to find one that is as thin and yet effective (perfect amount of suds) as simplehuman&#x27;s liquid soaps, sign me up.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best antibacterial hand soaps on the market, and one of the few home-use soaps that contain an active ingredient that is unquestionably effective against harmful pathogens. When considering the premium quality &amp; performance of this soap, this is one of the most affordable soaps on the market of its type, and overall a great value. As many great Reviews have already discussed the soap itself, my review is going to concentrate more on the active ingredient in this product, and why I feel it makes this soap superior to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USING THE SOAP&lt;br /&gt;I use this mainly with the smaller Simple Human dispenser and it works great. The smell is rather mild, the soap is easy-going on hands, it does not leave any residue, and it is concentrated enough that a little goes a long way. Despite being an antibacterial soap, this soap has good cleaning power to help physically remove dirt/grime from hands. This ability to effectively clean AND effectively disinfect makes this soap very versatile and a great choice for daily, general usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INEFFECTIVE ANTIBACTERIAL SOAP &amp; THE CASE OF TRICLOSAN&lt;br /&gt;In other reviews, I have criticized soaps &amp; cleaning products (and their makers) that are labeled as &amp;#34;antibacterial&amp;#34; and use triclosan as the active ingredient. Triclosan is arguably the snake oil of antimicrobials, and it makes up a huge portion of soaps sold as &amp;#34;antibacterial&amp;#34; because it is cheap to produce. However, there is a hidden price and a lot of misinformation regarding its effectiveness. Triclosan is NOT an effective antibacterial...in fact, it has almost zero benefit when used in soaps and the FDA is now in the process of banning makers from labeling their soap as being &amp;#34;antibacterial&amp;#34; if their only active ingredient is triclosan. Beyond being ineffective against bacteria, it does absolutely nothing against other pathogens that make us sick. Even worse is that research indicates long-term exposure to triclosan may be harmful and that it may be contributing to antibiotic resistance more than other products. I used triclosan soaps for many years before learning of its ineffectiveness and risks. And despite the countless research studies that have demonstrated triclosan as completely ineffective as an antibacterial agent in soap, many companies continue to use triclosan and label triclosan-based soaps as &amp;#34;antibacterial.&amp;#34; I feel that is unfair to consumers and somewhat ethically questionable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SIMPLE HUMAN MADE AN ANTIBACTERIAL SOAP THAT &#x3D;&#x3D;REALLY&#x3D;&#x3D; IS EFFECTIVE&lt;br /&gt;When a maker decides to produce an antibacterial soap and chooses to use an antimicrobial that is REALLY effective, they deserve credit; that is exactly the case here. The antimicrobial used in this soap is benzalkonium chloride. It is a wide-spectrum biocide that not only kills bacteria, but (with longer set times) also has virucidal, fungicidal, anti-protozoal properties. It is effective in killing resistant pathogens such as MRSA. In other words, the active ingredient in this Simple Human soap is extremely effective, in a world where the large majority of soaps sold as &amp;#34;antibacterial&amp;#34; are ineffective. Simple Human did not have to do this, but they chose to anyway, and that makes this a superior product. (Side Note -- benzalkonium chloride is an eye irritant and so this is obviously not a good facial scrub...it&#x27;s also not uncommon for it to slightly change the scent of a soaps, although the change is usually pretty mild.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CORRECT USAGE OF ANTIMICROBIAL SOAPS...THE SET-TIME IS THE KEY!&lt;br /&gt;When using any antimicrobial scrub or product, correct usage is the key to safe and effective usage. All antimicrobials have a &amp;#34;set time&amp;#34;, which is more or less how long the antimicrobial needs to make contact with a surface to work to a said degree (different pathogens take different times.) Just rubbing this soap on and rinsing it off immediately is not correct usage as it will not havesufficient time to work, and this can potentially contribute to the increasing issue of resistant pathogens (for that sort of super-quick hand wash without a set time, I use a soap without an antimicrobial.) So while benzalkonium chloride is generally fast-acting, it should still be given sufficient time to work. With this product I generally allow a set time of around 30-45 seconds once the lather has been made and hands are entirely covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION -- SIMPLE HUMAN DID THIS SOAP RIGHT, AND IT&#x27;S WORTH EVERY PENNY&lt;br /&gt;As a general rule, soaps with effective antimicrobials are expensive. This Simple Human soap is one of the least expensive antibacterial soaps on the market. When considering the quality of the soap&#x27;s ability to clean, the quantity of soap in each bag, how easy the soap is on skin, and how concentrated the soap is, this soap is an incredible buy. If you want to use a daily soap that can serve as an effective antimicrobial, this is the soap for you. Skip the cheaper products that contain ineffective active ingredients and go for this.

            <li> This is the best hand soap I&#x27;ve ever found. It leaves my hands soft and moisturized -- and clean! So many hand soaps leave my skin dried out, but this smells and feels amazing. I bought it somewhere and couldn&#x27;t find it again. So happy to find it here on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Really dried out my skin...</li>
            <li> Works well in my Simplehuman dispenser.  I think it is the best soap for that dispenser as is the correct viscosity.  Some of the other liquid soaps are just to thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We use this soap and the Simplehuman dispenser in our kitchen.  Very happy with both.</li>
            <li> This soap is ok, like all SimpleHuman soaps, except that it has a sickening smell, not at all what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aloe and cucumber is not how I would describe the scent of this soap.  It&#x27;s more like lemon-scented pine-sol, diluted with a bit of pine-scented pine-sol.  It&#x27;s pretty unpleasant.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t ordered two bags.</li>
            <li> The cucumber and aloe soap has a pleasant light sent which I love.  My hands never feel dried out after using it and it is specially formulated to work in my motion sensing dispenser.  Glad to see that Amazon carries it.</li>
            <li> This does not soap up ad good as the lavender.  Great product with very reasonable pricing though.  Simple human are a great brand.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for a hands free soap dispenser,  It was received very promptly and was a generous sized package.</li>
            <li> I liked the easy to pour spout, and the nice clean fragrance.</li>
            <li> works great. Was delivered 2 days after the order was placed.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a refill for kitchen and bathroom.  Works well.  It stores easily and the spout is stable and easy to pour with.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> this was a gift for my girl she loves it..  im sure she will bye this one or the other moisturizing soap refill..</li>
            <li> Love this soap and the easy to use bag it comes in. It makes filling the simple human soap dispenser so easy. Would definitely recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> The soap has a slight sanitary odor, and no perfume, but compared to similar antibacterial soaps, it is dilute (needs 2 pumps for handwash, compared to the customary 1)</li>
            <li> What can you say? I give 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t seem as caustic as the low cost refills I&#x27;ve bought before. Smells good too.</li>
            <li> I love the Simplehuman dispenser and I was thrilled that I could have the soap refills mailed to me. The soap is the right thickness for the dispenser.</li>
            <li> I love the refill soap, it is the only soap that does not clog up the dispenser, it is a bit pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> The soap is good but the dispenser is not that great</li>
            <li> Its super easy to use and smells so clean. They seem to be popular so being in stock can be the only downfall</li>
