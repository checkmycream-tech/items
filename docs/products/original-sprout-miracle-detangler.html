    <ol>
            <li>My daughter rinses out the leave in conditioner but doesn&#x27;t always do the best job rinsing</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>and now it works perfect for us.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s wonderful as a detangler before brushing but is also great to protect hair before swimming in the pool or a day at the beach.</li>
            <li>This works great in her hair.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Smells great but is not overpowering</li>
            <li>Sincerely, this is the best I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>best detangler for my daughters fine curly hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m all for smelling great (which this does), but I love the benefits of using the oils on your hair.</li>
            <li>It made me remember just how much I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>It is miracle for sure!</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant although we like more fruity smells....</li>
            <li>It was so amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazon is truly amazing and allowed me to return this product and gave me a credit.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing for starters.</li>
            <li>It works great, definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>This is, by far, the best detangler we have tried on my kids hair.  </li>
            <li>One has very fine hair</li>
            <li>The ones you can buy at walmart or target are so cheap, but do not do a thing with tangles!</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic as a detangler!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and have been using it for years together with the leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>It also really and truly detangles, which is great because I am growing my hair out and do not want to break any of it.</li>
            <li>Last time I saw him, he said my hair looked great and to keep using whatever I was using because it was doing really good things.</li>
            <li>It has a natural pleasant smell, isn&#x27;t greasy, and makes a brush go through my daughter&#x27;s hair very easily.</li>
            <li>That is more important to me than how well it works.</li>
            <li>I have a hairdresser who is very loyal to Moroccan Oil products.</li>
            <li>I think this is by far the most superior detangler on the market.</li>
            <li>The Sprout Miracle Detangler really works like magic and smells sooo nice.</li>
            <li>Too close, and you&#x27;ve shot a stream right at the child&#x27;s head in one spot! :)</li>
            <li>The results are instantaneous, soft, silky, amazing!  </li>
            <li>Easy to comb hair after 1 spray and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film to hair, but rather a smooth shiny finish.</li>
            <li>She has really fine blond curly hair</li>
            <li>They cant beleive how little you use to detangle and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>but I also haven&#x27;t had any huge bed head days with my two daughters either.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because it was purported to be such a great detangler.  </li>
            <li>Light scent, doesn&#x27;t make hair sticky.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you enjoy as much as we do!!</li>
            <li>and I cannot say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>hair brushes easily and is so much softer after use.</li>
            <li>I picked this up at a local salon and immediately fell in love with it!  </li>
            <li>and course (she has straight, fine hair).  </li>
            <li>With this spray, we have eliminated the tears and that alone makes it worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth</li>
            <li>I have been using Biolage leave in conditioner, which is a detangler and wanted to try something more natural.  </li>
            <li>On top of that, it smells good and it really does last a long time.  </li>
            <li>It works great for my curious 3 year old and deters her from spraying it all over the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My children&#x27;s hair is so soft and easy to comb after using this.  </li>
            <li>five year old has long think wavy hair and this really makes the transition from rats&#x27; nest to beautiful hair much easier.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried 3 or 4 other natural branded detanglers, but haven&#x27;t been totally happy with any of them.  </li>
            <li>also really appreciate the locking mechanism!</li>
            <li>At first i didnt like it until i figured out how to make it work.</li>
            <li>When we ran out of our first bottle, I went back to something else until I could get more ordered.  </li>
            <li>be sure to spray it in  your hand (we use 2 or 3 sprays for my daughters long hair) and rub it between your palms before spreading it through the hair.  </li>
            <li>this is definitely not that but still a fine smell.</li>
            <li>For the price I paid, I expected much more out of the nozzle.</li>
            <li>and it gets very tangled.  </li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve started using it every day, I have received several compliments on how soft, healthy and shiny my hair looks.</li>
            <li>The entire Original Sprout product line is what I would take if I were stranded on a desert island.  </li>
            <li>My other daughter has very thick hair and its not as fine as her sister, this works great in her hair too.</li>
            <li>I can say, you only need a quick spritz.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this detangler.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>If you spray too much or spray it directly on the hair, you will end up with greasy hair.</li>
            <li>It was getting harder and harder to brush her hair those mornings and this fills in nicely.</li>
            <li>and it definitely works better when the hair is really wet.</li>
            <li>The first bottle worked but the second bottle did not.</li>
            <li>Bonus that it is vegan and has natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>But...my 3-yr old has lots of ringlets</li>
            <li>I first heard about it on youtube from a girl who was promoting it to use with long hair.</li>
            <li>He always wants me to use them, but I don&#x27;t totally like what it does in my hair.</li>
            <li>used it on my 4 year old.</li>
            <li>i comb right thru it with a wide tooth comb.</li>
            <li>I can tell when other children use it as it is a distinct smell.</li>
            <li>I got this because she gets a huge knot in the back of her head when she lays down or is in her car seat</li>
            <li>True, it is on the pricey side, but if you&#x27;ve ever combed a little girl&#x27;s hair you know that it is a challenge.  </li>
            <li>I have now also started to use it on my older dog who has a long coat that mats.</li>
            <li>Hopefully they have fixed that since my last order!</li>
            <li>I mixed about 40 sprays of the Original Sprout, 1/4 cup of water and 1/2 of a teaspoon of Olive oil in a small spray bottle</li>
            <li>Finally I have found a detangler that actually works, AND leaves hair soft.</li>
            <li>After looking it up, what sold me on the price was the natural ingredients, especially the essential oils!</li>

            <li> She is not prone to large knots like I was as a kid but small tangles.</li>
            <li> They all left my daughters hair dry</li>
            <li> So far I have not had any trouble with this</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I waited this long to buy this.</li>
            <li> My daughter has frizzy, thick straight hair</li>
            <li> Its not a miracle- you need to use quite a bit on dry, thicker</li>
            <li> I know this might sound a little dramatic, but this stuff has transformed my hair.</li>
            <li> I think this bottle will last a long time since we use so little.</li>
            <li> my kid no longer cries when I brush her hair, wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> I have given the larger one to my little grandaughters.</li>
            <li> All of the other ones I have tried, dry out the hair and do nothing for the frizz, not to mention does nothing for the tangles too.</li>
            <li> The consistency is just too thick to penetrate my toddlers african american hair.</li>
            <li> A little bit does go a long way as another reviewer mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, if you use too much (especially on dry hair), it will look greasy.</li>
            <li> Some other reviews mentioned greasiness, but that has not been a problem for us.  </li>
            <li> I took off one star due to the jacked up sprayer.</li>
            <li> It may work bettter for other ethnicities or other hair types.</li>
            <li> I use it liberally and it never makes my hair look greasy or filmy like some other leave-ins do.</li>
            <li> My girls can still have their curls too as it doesn&#x27;t weigh their hair down like other detanglers.</li>
            <li> It actually made my hair feel very hard and brittle; not soft at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quick mention on the spritz itself, definitely hold it at least 6 inches from head and it should do an all over spray.</li>
            <li> A bottle lasts about 3 months for us if I water it down a tad towards the end.</li>
            <li> I spray her hair down with filtered water and then mist this throughout her hair.  </li>
            <li> About half way through, the nozzle stopped spraying</li>
            <li> but I cannot recommend this product to anyone whose hair is normally a mess of tangles.</li>
            <li> She has long, wavy hair that is medium thick.</li>
            <li> A little spray I rub in it and it brushes without and pulling or tugging.</li>
            <li> works well, but seems to leave the hair heavy.</li>
            <li> It takes very little work to get through her hair after applying this.</li>
            <li> I have bought two bottles of this in the past.</li>
            <li> We use it half strength on my daughters very thick hard to manage Caucasian hair, I save half the bottle in a jar and add water to the rest of the bottle and shake.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product made it near impossible to loosen the tangles once it was in my hair.</li>
            <li> We use it twice a day and it doesn&#x27;t leave any built up behind.  </li>
            <li> So i decided to thin it out.</li>
            <li> WORSE WEEK OF MY LIFE!  </li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;The spray bottle stinks though; it leaks and jams up and gets product everywhere.</li>
            <li> so I had to awkwardly use the remaining product without it.</li>
            <li> Hate how expensive this stuff is!  </li>
            <li> and I hate to make her cry every morning when combing out her hair.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of detanglers on my three girls lonnnnng hair. The ones you can buy at walmart or target are so cheap, but do not do a thing with tangles! I think this is by far the most superior detangler on the market. Easy to comb hair after 1 spray and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film to hair, but rather a smooth shiny finish. My girls can still have their curls too as it doesn&#x27;t weigh their hair down like other detanglers. The smell is pleasant although we like more fruity smells....this is definitely not that but still a fine smell. I can tell when other children use it as it is a distinct smell. I can say, you only need a quick spritz. A little bit does go a long way as another reviewer mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick mention on the spritz itself, definitely hold it at least 6 inches from head and it should do an all over spray. Too close, and you&#x27;ve shot a stream right at the child&#x27;s head in one spot! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really appreciate the locking mechanism! It works great for my curious 3 year old and deters her from spraying it all over the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you enjoy as much as we do!!</li>
            <li> So far I have not had any trouble with this but I also haven&#x27;t had any huge bed head days with my two daughters either. One has very fine hair but there is a lot of it! I got this because she gets a huge knot in the back of her head when she lays down or is in her car seat and I had to cut one out because I didn&#x27;t brush it out in time and she played with it. This works great in her hair. My other daughter has very thick hair and its not as fine as her sister, this works great in her hair too. It takes very little work to get through her hair after applying this.</li>
            <li> Having tried numerous detanglers on my daughter&#x27;s hair, this was a hail mary.  Now, it is the only detangler I will use.  True, it is on the pricey side, but if you&#x27;ve ever combed a little girl&#x27;s hair you know that it is a challenge.  With this spray, we have eliminated the tears and that alone makes it worth the price.  On top of that, it smells good and it really does last a long time.  Some other reviews mentioned greasiness, but that has not been a problem for us.  We use it twice a day and it doesn&#x27;t leave any built up behind.  I would highly recommend this detangler.</li>
            <li> The Sprout Miracle Detangler really works like magic and smells sooo nice. My daughter&#x27;s (4) hair brushes easily and is so much softer after use. Even hours after use! If you&#x27;re still on the fence about trying it, just do it! Totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;The spray bottle stinks though; it leaks and jams up and gets product everywhere. Wish they could make that better, since its so expensive. This is the 2nd time this has happened to us.</li>
            <li> This product made my kid stop hating washing her hair. I would literally have to chase her around to comb it and no matter what we used, it would either feel sticky and matted, or over-product-ed and greasy or worse,stripped.  The results are instantaneous, soft, silky, amazing!  The entire Original Sprout product line is what I would take if I were stranded on a desert island.  We ran out of this accidentally and had to use something else for a week.... WORSE WEEK OF MY LIFE!  Now we buy in bulk and my kid no longer cries when I brush her hair, wet or dry.  She also no longer wakes up looking like Tina Turner in &amp;#34;Beyond Thunderdome&amp;#34;.  Sincerely, this is the best I have ever used.  Try it and thank me later.</li>
            <li> not a fan of the smell</li>
            <li> This stuff works. Enough said.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic as a detangler! We use it half strength on my daughters very thick hard to manage Caucasian hair, I save half the bottle in a jar and add water to the rest of the bottle and shake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s wonderful as a detangler before brushing but is also great to protect hair before swimming in the pool or a day at the beach. I love this stuff and have been using it for years together with the leave in conditioner. My daughter rinses out the leave in conditioner but doesn&#x27;t always do the best job rinsing so it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I waited this long to buy this. It has a natural pleasant smell, isn&#x27;t greasy, and makes a brush go through my daughter&#x27;s hair very easily. She has long, wavy hair that is medium thick. She is not prone to large knots like I was as a kid but small tangles. This works wonders especially for the nights when she takes a rinse off shower without using conditioner. It was getting harder and harder to brush her hair those mornings and this fills in nicely. Bonus that it is vegan and has natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> At first i didnt like it until i figured out how to make it work. The consistency is just too thick to penetrate my toddlers african american hair. So i decided to thin it out. I mixed about 40 sprays of the Original Sprout, 1/4 cup of water and 1/2 of a teaspoon of Olive oil in a small spray bottle and now it works perfect for us. This mixture is just enough to detangle her entire head. I think this bottle will last a long time since we use so little. I took off one star due to the jacked up sprayer.</li>
            <li> Finally I have found a detangler that actually works, AND leaves hair soft. All of the other ones I have tried, dry out the hair and do nothing for the frizz, not to mention does nothing for the tangles too. My daughter has frizzy, thick straight hair and I will never ever run out of this stuff. A little goes a long way, if you use too much (especially on dry hair), it will look greasy.</li>
            <li> I heard about this from another mom at my daughters school. After looking it up, what sold me on the price was the natural ingredients, especially the essential oils! I&#x27;m all for smelling great (which this does), but I love the benefits of using the oils on your hair. It works great, definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it was purported to be such a great detangler.  I am AA, AI and W...my hair is mid back length, growing the perm out of my hair.  I have been using Biolage leave in conditioner, which is a detangler and wanted to try something more natural.  It is actually about the same as the Biolage. I will use it up, but I will not purchase again.  It may work bettter for other ethnicities or other hair types.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at my salon for myself to try. It was so amazing. I bought the larger bottle for the same price on Amazon. I have given the larger one to my little grandaughters. They cant beleive how little you use to detangle and it smells wonderful. I have now also started to use it on my older dog who has a long coat that mats. A little spray I rub in it and it brushes without and pulling or tugging. Great product.</li>
            <li> Hate how expensive this stuff is!  But...my 3-yr old has lots of ringlets and I hate to make her cry every morning when combing out her hair. Its not a miracle- you need to use quite a bit on dry, thicker hair- but it does what its supposed to do and without a ton of chemicals. That is more important to me than how well it works. Smells great but is not overpowering and it definitely works better when the hair is really wet. A bottle lasts about 3 months for us if I water it down a tad towards the end. The sprayer on our last bottle clogged up all of the time and leaked and the bottle was a thinner plastic. Hopefully they have fixed that since my last order!</li>
            <li> This detangler is not for everyone, especially not me. It actually made my hair feel very hard and brittle; not soft at all. I have the hair that tangles as soon as you look at it. I can spend an hour detangling it and it will immediately start tangling back up again. This product made it near impossible to loosen the tangles once it was in my hair. I had to wash it out and start over again detangling sans Miracle. Sorry but I cannot recommend this product to anyone whose hair is normally a mess of tangles. I truly wanted Miracle to work and maybe for others it may well prove differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maria C.&lt;br /&gt;PS&lt;br /&gt;Luckily Amazon is truly amazing and allowed me to return this product and gave me a credit.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend. Light scent, doesn&#x27;t make hair sticky.&lt;br /&gt;My five year old has long think wavy hair and this really makes the transition from rats&#x27; nest to beautiful hair much easier.</li>
            <li> I know this might sound a little dramatic, but this stuff has transformed my hair. I first heard about it on youtube from a girl who was promoting it to use with long hair. I purchased it for my daughter and she loves it. I ended it up using it on myself too and I cannot say enough good things about this product. It smells amazing for starters. It also really and truly detangles, which is great because I am growing my hair out and do not want to break any of it. Since I&#x27;ve started using it every day, I have received several compliments on how soft, healthy and shiny my hair looks. I use it liberally and it never makes my hair look greasy or filmy like some other leave-ins do. I have a hairdresser who is very loyal to Moroccan Oil products. He always wants me to use them, but I don&#x27;t totally like what it does in my hair. Last time I saw him, he said my hair looked great and to keep using whatever I was using because it was doing really good things. I am hooked on this stuff and I hope it&#x27;s around forever!</li>
            <li> I have bought two bottles of this in the past. The first bottle worked but the second bottle did not. About half way through, the nozzle stopped spraying so I had to awkwardly use the remaining product without it. For the price I paid, I expected much more out of the nozzle. Because of this I have switched to a different product and will not be purchasing this again in the future.</li>
            <li> works well, but seems to leave the hair heavy. used it on my 4 year old.</li>
            <li> This is, by far, the best detangler we have tried on my kids hair.  We&#x27;ve tried 3 or 4 other natural branded detanglers, but haven&#x27;t been totally happy with any of them.  They all left my daughters hair dry and course (she has straight, fine hair).  I picked this up at a local salon and immediately fell in love with it!  When we ran out of our first bottle, I went back to something else until I could get more ordered.  It made me remember just how much I love this stuff!  My children&#x27;s hair is so soft and easy to comb after using this.  Just a tip:  be sure to spray it in  your hand (we use 2 or 3 sprays for my daughters long hair) and rub it between your palms before spreading it through the hair.  Start with the ends and work your way up.  If you spray too much or spray it directly on the hair, you will end up with greasy hair.</li>
            <li> best detangler for my daughters fine curly hair. My daughter is 1/4 nigerian and 3/4 european.  She has really fine blond curly hair and it gets very tangled.  I spray her hair down with filtered water and then mist this throughout her hair.  They i comb right thru it with a wide tooth comb. It is miracle for sure!</li>
