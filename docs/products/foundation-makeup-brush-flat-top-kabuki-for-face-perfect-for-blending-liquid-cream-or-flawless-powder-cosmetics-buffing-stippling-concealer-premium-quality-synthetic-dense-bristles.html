            <li>but it did a better job.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but there&#x27;s just enough give to blend your liquid foundation perfectly.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I love kabuki brushes.</li>

            <li>I am very happy with this purchase and plan on purchasing Lamora&#x27;s tapered end brush in the same line for more precision application around the eyes and nose.  </li>
            <li>I would really love to try more brushes from Lamora after this one.</li>
            <li>I Love this kabuki brush.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering two more.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more.  </li>
            <li>I will purchase more of this product line as I need to replace my stock.  </li>
            <li>I appreciate the price of Lamora brushes, but I prefer a more dense (Sigma) brush.</li>
            <li>Eh, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>This flat kabuki is much better , giving better coverage.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This flat top kabuki brush is very exquisite in craftsmanship and detail.</li>
            <li>used the flat top for both powder and cream blush and it applied both flawlessly!!!</li>
            <li>This quickly became my favorite foundation brush!</li>
            <li>This really was an amazing purchase!</li>
            <li>pretty good product.</li>
            <li>your someone with blemishes or new to makeup, invest in a great foundation brush to get the most natural look and great coverage application.</li>
            <li>The case is designed with a snap closure to keep the dry brushes protected, and is very attractive and sturdy.  </li>
            <li>It buffs my foundation in so smoothly and my make up looks air brushed and flawless...</li>
            <li>it is really nice brush for such a great price,&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>Better than most brushes and really comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li>Received this brush as part of a promotion, and it was worth way more than what I paid for it!</li>
            <li>I love that the bristles are so compact and it helps it blend powder foundation so smoothly.</li>
            <li>I use powder foundation and this really grabs a good amount of the product and lets me buff it on with no issues.</li>
            <li>I was lucky to be able to try it complimentary for a honest and unbiased opinion.  </li>
            <li>helps the liquid foundation to stay on my skin and easy to blend colors as well.&lt;br /&gt;Brush</li>
            <li>It is so soft to the skin and really gives you that flawless look to your skin.</li>
            <li>Ok, so far so good.</li>
            <li>I just received this brush and so far I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fall out easily which is a huge plus for a foundation brush.</li>
            <li>This brush works perfectly with Bare Minerals Ready foundation.</li>
            <li>Probably fine for the $10 price point as I paid twice that for MAC brush, so it garners three stars.</li>
            <li>The brush came really quickly too!</li>
            <li>Good quality and the bristles are so soft!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean, and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Applies product well, and easy clean up.</li>
            <li>Feels so smooth on my face</li>
            <li>but I was really thrilled to find this one that works just as well at a much lower cost.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this brush has great potential if improvements are made.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, no fall out.</li>
            <li>I used it with YSL Eclat foundation, and the coverage was even, smooth all over the face.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean</li>
            <li>It falls somewhere in between the light application/blending from a sponge, but the ability to build that you get from a--yuck--regular foundation brush.</li>
            <li>and I had been using  those cheap sponge applicators</li>
            <li>I use cover girl Aqua Smooth makeup in the compact but the applicator sponge that comes with it leaves streaks all over my face.</li>
            <li>I was using a popular blender sponge before trying this brush, and I am so much happier with this for my liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>make-up goes on smoothly, without caking.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway overall, for the price, I thought the product is great.</li>
            <li>Smooth all over going on</li>
            <li>Puts my bronzer on smoothly and even.  </li>
            <li>I would give 1 star, but it was free.  </li>
            <li>Upon opening the package in the 2nd picture with the plastic cap that was holding the brush head into place, I knew I was getting a great item when I saw that.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because it&#x27;s just not as dense as the Moprhe brush, but it is still a great brush.</li>
            <li>I received this a few weeks ago and it is a great foundation brush!</li>
            <li>Applied foundation so smoothly.</li>
            <li>Completely smooth application.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it would actually be free</li>
            <li>I received this brush free as a promotion and have been using it for over a month.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied witht the quality of this brush; it is good as blush brush, but not dense enough as a foundation brush, hence the 4 stars.</li>
            <li>Feeling of Brushes are better than I used so I can do better make up Thanks.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to stop swirling on my face because it felt so good and soft.</li>
            <li>Really the best thing short of airbrushing!</li>
            <li>I got the brush about 3 weeks ago but didn&#x27;t give a feedback right away as I want to be sure I&#x27;d give an accurate assessment of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is very comparable to higher end brushes, and I could not be more pleased with this purchase!</li>
            <li>Just as good as the Sigma flat top kabuki brush.</li>
            <li>Soo soft and easy to use !!</li>
            <li>I immediatly thought this was going to be another cheap brush and wasnt too excited to use it.</li>
            <li>When I got the brush I loved it; it was nice and soft and the perfect firmness, and it still is, only the metal is now loose from the wood handle and it feels like it&#x27;s going to fall apart any day.  </li>
            <li>and I hope the production of eye makeup brushes for blending eyeshadow and eyeliner and also brushes for facial contor , excellent and high quality, but I do not see kabuki brushes set with cupholder ,,&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>This was my first time buying a foundation brush, and I really love this brush.</li>
            <li>I am more interested in quality than quantity, so the items that I use that are subjected to &amp;#34;daily wear and tear&amp;#34; must &amp;#34;stand the test of time&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>When I first received this brush I made sure to clean it so it would up to the challenge.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed with Lamora&#x27;s Flat top kabuki, especially since I washed it again for use tomorrow and still not shedding!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried and tested some of brush sets personally and by far this is one of the best one I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>I bought two anticipating issues or having to clean it all the time</li>
            <li>I just love this Flat Top Kabuki Brush!</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft and dense and blend wonderfully; I love them!</li>
            <li>The Flat Kabuki blended my BB Cream beautifully, and none of the product got sucked into the brush making it super easy and fast the clean.</li>
            <li>it arrived very quickly, and it&#x27;s just the right size for applying and blending my bb cream and foundation.  </li>
            <li>When I compared it to the sigma f80 flat top kabuki brush this one is just as amazing and cheaper.</li>
            <li>The flat , rounded top kind.  </li>
            <li>, this is more dense than other brush, and work really good with my liquid</li>
            <li>Holds minimal color in the bristles and great application.</li>
            <li>this brush is amazing quality and its soft..</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind leaving reviews but the seller really emailed a lot more than I appreciate, asking for reviews or advertising their products.</li>
            <li>Love it makes my makeup look much smoother.</li>
            <li>a full review will be on my blog soon.</li>
            <li>much I bought 2 more.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t receive my full purchase.</li>
            <li>Now, just let me say I was kinda hesitant to use this brush because my absolute favorite foundation brush is my Morphe 439.</li>
            <li>Nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Not bad at all for price.</li>
            <li>I love it, its soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li>So easy to use and soft on my face :)</li>
            <li>Exactly as they described and shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>Super soft and easy to use:)</li>
            <li>and I feel it goes on much better than my older brushes.</li>
            <li>Super dense,</li>
            <li>Super buy.</li>
            <li>Also quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I really like that they are marked on each brush what each one is for as I can easily look up what they were designed to do by reading their (PDF download)after my purchase which provides more detailed information on each brush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely in love withe the Lamora Beauty Foundation Flat Top Kabuki Brush.</li>
            <li>The Lamora flat top kabuki brush is top notch.</li>
            <li>I just received  my Lamora flat top brush and i absolutely  LOVE</li>
            <li>I started using this brush to buff out the streaks, and I got compliments on the smoothness of my makeup the very first time I tried it.</li>
            <li>The shipping was very fast!</li>
            <li>Like it very much !</li>
            <li>OK, yes, I received a free flat top kabuki from Lamora, but I really do like it!</li>
            <li>I saw the ad for this brush on Facebook and was drawn in by the fact that it would be free for the first 50 or so people to click on it.</li>
            <li>Im new to makeup and love it..</li>
            <li>Love my new foundation brush, it works just like I am using it to paint a canvas.</li>
            <li>later- loved the brush so much had to be a replacement brush!</li>
            <li>Very even application and easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love it over the foundation brush and its very soft.</li>
            <li>I received the Kabusi Facial brush (foundation) and I love it!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described!</li>
            <li>I love how natural this brush makes my foundation looks!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super soft :)</li>
            <li>I am using SO MUCH LESS foundation than I used to use with what I was told was the best brush because it was fox fur (natural).</li>
            <li>Nice product, reasonably priced, and very soft on the face.</li>
            <li>received free as a promotion .wonderful , delivers loose powder amazingly.</li>
            <li>I waited a little bit to review this brush because I wanted to give an accurate and fair review.</li>
            <li>This brush helps smooth the product evenly over your face and blends out very well.</li>
            <li>I did receive this when they sent customers a free coupon code for this product which I really appreciate.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I love how soft and sturdy the brush is.</li>
            <li>I use mine for foundation, mostly, but it&#x27;s so soft, it can be used for anything!&lt;br /&gt;Mine</li>
            <li>This creates more need for blending until application is seamless (well, its version).</li>
            <li>The brush was well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I am loving this brush and will be purchasing the entire set.  </li>
            <li>Good brush really soft and applies foundation on very well without using too much .</li>
            <li>It is sooo darn soft that I kept touching the brush over my fingers.</li>
            <li>It gives a nice air brushed effect when I stipple and then use in a circular motion.</li>
            <li>Love this brush, soft bristles that don&#x27;t fall out</li>
            <li>I own Sigma foundation kabuki brushes and although Lamora brushes look similar, they are not as dense as my Sigma brushes.  </li>
            <li>The brush is very full and the bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that other brushes are just as good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and actually saves you money by using just the bare minimum of your mineral powders and covers flawlessly!  </li>
            <li>and I used it right away.</li>
            <li>(right now I&#x27;m using it with Tarte foundation).  </li>
            <li>But i thought since they are giving these out for free and pretty much every review i read was 5 stars</li>
            <li>Great quality brush for little cost!</li>
            <li>Highly recomended this product and these fantastic Seller</li>
            <li>I like the style of the brush and the bristles are nice and soft (So Gentle &#x27;); it&#x27;s very versatile.</li>
            <li>Price is reasonable and quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>Make up applications looks great after using this and equivalent to more expensive brushes.  </li>
            <li>For the price no one would regret spending a few $ to achieve such a flawless finish foundation application.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much smoother and more natural my foundation looks with this brush.</li>
            <li>So soft &amp; easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and applies foundation smoothly.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I was very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Works really well blending out product and gives a nice,  air-brushed finish (I am using it with BB cream as opposed to regular liquid foundation, but I&#x27;ve heard it works even better with the latter).</li>
            <li>And, the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>Delivery came very fast.</li>
            <li>thanks so much!!</li>
            <li>I find that the &amp;#34;real techniques&amp;#34; flat top stippling brush is much better (also cheaper), since the duo fibres help release more of the make up onto your skin without being held and trapped in the brush.</li>
            <li>After using it for a little over a week, and after 2 washes, it still looks as good and feels like it did the first day I received it.</li>
            <li>Will purchase more of these in the future.</li>
            <li>It would be even better if it had a smaller size of brush.</li>
            <li>It is my first foundation brush, and it works a lot better than regular sponges or puffs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It  is  first  time  </li>
            <li>I love the way it applies both powder and liquid; especially the liquid (it leave no streaky marks).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and applies my foundation so smoothly.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I washed the brush first with my mac brush cleaner since it says to wash before using.</li>
            <li>I have used this brush a few times and find that it is a pretty good brush for the price.  </li>
            <li>I dab it on until most of the foundation is applied, then I do some blending with the same brush.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty durable</li>
            <li>I have been buy expensive brushes from mac but the one is wonderful.</li>
            <li>would recommend as alternative to higher end brushes like sigma f80.</li>
            <li>First foundation brush I have used.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>No weird bleeding dyes or bristles falling out during the washing process and the smell went away</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more brushes by this brand.</li>
            <li>Fast service!</li>
            <li>Given the dual tone of the bristles, I thought this brush would be duo fibre, but the bristles are just dyed white at the top.</li>
            <li>Not only do I love my brush</li>
            <li>I was looking for another flat top Kabuki brush after my Sigma F80 basically fell apart.  </li>
            <li>The lamora foundation flat top brush was just delivered to me</li>
            <li>The bristles are not dense but flimsey, unlike a Kabuki Flat top brush should be.  </li>
            <li>Better than sponges, fingers, or flat brushes for application.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had experience with more expensive versions of this, but it seems to do a good job of applying my foundation</li>
            <li>This poses a problem because at times I tend to apply my eyeshadows and brow application before foundation and you cannot get into certain areas unless you really pinch the tip of the bristles, because it&#x27;s so flared!</li>
            <li>My handle fell off on the bottom half but that is ok because the part I need is what works!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The number of positive feedbacks, the promotional offer, and most importantly, to save money from having to shell out for a second Shiseido brush as backup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this brush for a period of two weeks prior to submitting my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I own Sigma, Sephora, mac, mineral fusion and other more expensive brushes, but I must say that I am very pleased with my Lamora brushes.  </li>
            <li>I mainly use it for a more sheer coverage and ALWAYS press it into the skin with the foundation.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience using a brush to use after putting liquid foundation and it made a huge difference in the overall appearance of my makeup.  </li>
            <li>Knocking off one star only because there is definitely a strong odor once you take off the packaging and took 2-3 washes with baby shampoo to fully get that smell gone.  </li>
            <li>If you are a makeup/brush conesseiour, you can make it work to a certain degree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Soft and very gentle!</li>
            <li>The handle is very sturdy and the brush is super soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>In all honestly I thought that it was just going to be just another &amp;#34;Amazon&amp;#34; make up brush that was going to be cheap &amp; be harsh on my skin when used, but I was VERY surprised upon receiving it how SOFT yet STURDY the brush was.</li>
            <li>The brush is also fluffy and super easy to use for those applying foundation with a brush for the first time.</li>
            <li>The brush itself is ok, nothing special, the handle is too long for my personal taste.</li>
            <li>Amazing quality for such a low price...</li>
            <li>I use this brush to apply my cream foundation and it blends very well giving my face an airbrush affect.  </li>
            <li>It has held up very well and no bristles have fallen out.</li>
            <li>my foundation very well</li>
            <li>Works really well.  </li>
            <li>how fast this gif to me.</li>
            <li>but that isn&#x27;t really a problem.</li>
            <li>For the price point, I&#x27;d like to compare this with the Real Techniques Expert Face Brush.</li>
            <li>Really was amazed by this brush.</li>
            <li>Thanks lamora beauty for this brush.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my sister and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it (with my normal make up)</li>
            <li>I gave 4 stars because for the time I had it performed very well.</li>
            <li>High quality!</li>
            <li>and I really endorse this Kabuki brush from Lamora Beauty on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It really passed the test.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush for applying my foundations.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even use my Real Technique and  Estee Lauder brushes anymore.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Lamora</li>
            <li>Sucks up my product And doesn&#x27;t really apply product good</li>
            <li>I have been wanting to buy a sigma brush for a long time but honestly, these feel the exact same as sigma.</li>
            <li>I use it for both my liquid and powder foundation and barely have to use any for that full coverage look.</li>
            <li>Or for mature clients who prefer a more sheer and matte coverage.</li>
            <li>This brush is worth buying, it feels amazing in my skin too why didn&#x27;t I found this a long time ago.arrived fast on expected promised day.</li>
            <li>Having lighter tips it is much easier to clean as you can see the makeup stains and how deep it goes.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic flat brush for applying foundation .  </li>
            <li>Hopefully there&#x27;s more sales for their other brushes soon.</li>
            <li>I will stick with my other favorite one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and works as just as good as the one from Sigma that I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>I use it every day, and really helps use less product, with a much better finish.</li>
            <li>So far its pretty sturdy, well put together.</li>
            <li>Awesome brush, and the same quality as the other one I have that was more expensive.  </li>
            <li>The flat top is great for the planes of the face, and the tips of the bristles are small enough that contoured facial areas are covered too.  </li>
            <li>As soon as the larger set gets back in stock, I will be buying more of these.  </li>
            <li>Very soft and makes application much easier.</li>
            <li>So I wasnt too sure about this brush since i only like to use name brand brushes such as mac and high end brushes.</li>
            <li>This u a fabulous product that does not shed or loose it&#x27;s shape.</li>
            <li>Thank you for an affordable yet high quality product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to pay $30+ for a high end brush</li>
            <li>Highly recommended product.</li>
            <li>and I have high standards.</li>
            <li>This is now my go to brush, I highly recommend this brush for your BB cream, foundation, powder, etc.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly for my Bare Minerals Bareskin liquid foundation at less then half the price (I bought it on a one-day markdown) of the Bare Minerals brush that is sold for that purpose.</li>
            <li>It is very soft and cleaning it 1 x every week, at least every two weeks really keeps the brush fresh and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The application is gentle and extremely soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m probably going to get a few more from this line soon.</li>
            <li>But for the price point normally I would repurchase either way.</li>
            <li>I did notice that my Sigma brush is just slightly more dense and to make sure that I gave it a true comparison, I did half my face with Sigma and the other half With Lamora.</li>
            <li>Dense enough for full coverage, lush and soft!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly new to make up</li>
            <li>and so I decided to try something new.</li>
            <li>The brush is very soft.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft when applying to my face.  </li>
            <li>Makeup looks very  natural.</li>
            <li>Bristles are very soft and brush is well made.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and none of the bristles came out after washing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft, although it isn&#x27;t as dense as it looks.</li>
            <li>Super luxe and doesn&#x27;t loose hairs.  </li>
            <li>It is extremely soft but very good at applying the makeup I have tired it on both powder and of a powder type wet makeup.</li>
            <li>The next time I need something I will check here first.</li>
            <li>For years I&#x27;ve used a sponge to apply my makeup but recently switched to a higher end foundation and the sales woman recommended the Kabuiki.</li>
            <li>The bristles ARE SO SOFT!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just so soft!</li>
            <li>Only when i washed it that first time.</li>
            <li>My friend has the Sigma F80 and this is pretty similar!</li>
            <li>They preformed EXACTLY the same!!!</li>
            <li>though the Lamora brush isn&#x27;t as dense as the Sigma F80, I still received the exact same results!</li>
            <li>Ordered as gift for significant other.</li>
            <li>I did purchase the entire 10 brush set on September 30, 2014, but for some reason, I can&#x27;t leave a review on it because I bought this one brush first, and it didn&#x27;t allow me to leave THAT review.  </li>
            <li>if not better but might not have as many ratings because the company does not incessantly pester their customers to leave a review.</li>
            <li>Plus, I am using less foundation since it blends the coverage smooth and evenly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended and worth the money.i will purchase other products.</li>
            <li>The next day when the brush was dry i used it with my cream foundation and this smoothed my foundation on so smoothly and evenly</li>
            <li>I never used a Lamora product before and certainly will in the future,</li>
            <li>I do that trick of dotting my face really fast with it (forget the term) and with so little make up, I get so much coverage and so fast.</li>
            <li>I find that the bristles are a bit stiff and not as comfortable as other brushes that I have, but it is not a bad thing.  </li>
            <li>This brush is velvety soft and dense enough to hold and blend product very well.</li>
            <li>The brush is so soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this wasn&#x27;t made out of dog hair from China.</li>
            <li>This brush applies foundation smooth and with a few strokes.</li>
            <li>This brush is so soft and doesn&#x27;t shed at all.</li>
            <li>The brush is so soft.</li>
            <li>I plan on buying the whole set as soon as they bring it back.</li>
            <li>It is also SOOO Soft.</li>
            <li>It is so soft and does buffer well.</li>
            <li>Bristles remained soft and fluffy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>That one is smaller but really dense.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s think and soft</li>
            <li>far i like it,  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised with this brush.</li>
            <li>It is soft.</li>
            <li>The bristles are so soft</li>
            <li>This Lamora brush is a very close second.</li>
            <li>Used the brush a couple times and like it a lot so far.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so soft and distributes my foundation so well and evenly.</li>
            <li>Its so soft and applies foundation so well.</li>
            <li>It is incredibly soft and works wonders.</li>
            <li>They are sooooo soft,</li>
            <li>Its really soft.</li>
            <li>This brush is dense, soft, and hasn&#x27;t shed a bristle.</li>
            <li>I am not a make-up artist, but I like durable, soft, dense, and shed-free brushes.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve have purchased from this company before and had a bad experience with the 8 brush set (I will say their customer service was amazing), but this particular brush is actually pretty well made!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why the standard foundation brush is even still being used by most people when a brush like this exists.</li>
            <li>Who would not love a FREE BRUSH</li>
            <li>It rinses easily, too; I use a very mild soap to wash mine, with hot tap water, rinse in cold water, and the bristles are dry in several hours.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i was little hesitate to order  flat top Kabuki, because 6 piece set has almost same size Kabuki...</li>
            <li>The following day I experimented with my new tool with optimism...</li>
            <li>I actually prefer to use this over the new Sigma 3dhd Kabuki brush.</li>
            <li>Im interested in trying this brands other brushes.</li>
            <li>It applies a little bit better with a tinted moisturizer versus foundation which appears to weigh down the tip of the bristles causing that streaky effect.</li>
            <li>Wow - my only regret is not buying this brush sooner!</li>
            <li>The brush isn&#x27;t too large, as some other kabuki brushes, so it works well with mineral make-up.</li>
            <li>By this I mean, you are not getting a cheap product.</li>
            <li>I used pretty much same amount as I would with my other foundation</li>
            <li>bristles are too soft and not tapered enough, which causes them to fold in every which direction without proper precision.</li>
            <li>I use this especially for younger clients(highschool prom photos, young bridesmaids.)</li>
            <li>The bristles are high quality which will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li>My only concern is that I&#x27;ve had my Sigma F80 for MUCH longer, and the handle on this one is already loose despite the fact that I wash them the same way.</li>
            <li>However, not sure if it was the BB cream or the brush, but it seemed like the BB cream wasn&#x27;t absorbed on skin</li>
            <li>I am highly considering all of the other brushes for my kit.</li>

            <li> but I haven&#x27;t had any more fall out since.</li>
            <li> and I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li> - It was ok when used on powder foundation.</li>
            <li> but I think the brush picked up more product than needed.</li>
            <li> gave it a 4 star just cause I want it to be more dense.</li>

            <li> Love the brush.</li>

            <li> but it did a better job.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s just enough give to blend your liquid foundation perfectly.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I love kabuki brushes.</li>
            <li> I felt like it works better for liquid foundation versus my powder</li>
            <li> I am truly impressed with the construction of this brush, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> I love , love, love this brush.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this brush.</li>

            <li> Love this brush.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a great brush at a reasonable price for applying my makeup</li>
            <li> My sigma brush and beautie junkie brushes are so much better.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this brush.  </li>

            <li> I am very happy with this purchase and plan on purchasing Lamora&#x27;s tapered end brush in the same line for more precision application around the eyes and nose.  </li>
            <li> I would really love to try more brushes from Lamora after this one.</li>

            <li> I will be ordering more.  </li>
            <li> I will purchase more of this product line as I need to replace my stock.  </li>
            <li> I appreciate the price of Lamora brushes, but I prefer a more dense (Sigma) brush.</li>
            <li> Eh, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> This flat kabuki is much better , giving better coverage.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This flat top kabuki brush is very exquisite in craftsmanship and detail.</li>
            <li> used the flat top for both powder and cream blush and it applied both flawlessly!!!</li>
            <li> This quickly became my favorite foundation brush!</li>
            <li> This really was an amazing purchase!</li>
            <li> pretty good product.</li>
            <li> your someone with blemishes or new to makeup, invest in a great foundation brush to get the most natural look and great coverage application.</li>
            <li> The case is designed with a snap closure to keep the dry brushes protected, and is very attractive and sturdy.  </li>
            <li> It buffs my foundation in so smoothly and my make up looks air brushed and flawless...</li>
            <li> it is really nice brush for such a great price,&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> Better than most brushes and really comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li> Received this brush as part of a promotion, and it was worth way more than what I paid for it!</li>
            <li> I love that the bristles are so compact and it helps it blend powder foundation so smoothly.</li>
            <li> I use powder foundation and this really grabs a good amount of the product and lets me buff it on with no issues.</li>
            <li> I was lucky to be able to try it complimentary for a honest and unbiased opinion.  </li>
            <li> helps the liquid foundation to stay on my skin and easy to blend colors as well.&lt;br /&gt;Brush</li>
            <li> It is so soft to the skin and really gives you that flawless look to your skin.</li>
            <li> Ok, so far so good.</li>
            <li> I just received this brush and so far I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fall out easily which is a huge plus for a foundation brush.</li>
            <li> This brush works perfectly with Bare Minerals Ready foundation.</li>
            <li> Probably fine for the $10 price point as I paid twice that for MAC brush, so it garners three stars.</li>
            <li> The brush came really quickly too!</li>
            <li> Good quality and the bristles are so soft!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean, and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Applies product well, and easy clean up.</li>
            <li> Feels so smooth on my face</li>
            <li> but I was really thrilled to find this one that works just as well at a much lower cost.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this brush has great potential if improvements are made.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, no fall out.</li>
            <li> I used it with YSL Eclat foundation, and the coverage was even, smooth all over the face.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean</li>
            <li> It falls somewhere in between the light application/blending from a sponge, but the ability to build that you get from a--yuck--regular foundation brush.</li>
            <li> and I had been using  those cheap sponge applicators</li>
            <li> I use cover girl Aqua Smooth makeup in the compact but the applicator sponge that comes with it leaves streaks all over my face.</li>
            <li> I was using a popular blender sponge before trying this brush, and I am so much happier with this for my liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> make-up goes on smoothly, without caking.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway overall, for the price, I thought the product is great.</li>
            <li> Smooth all over going on</li>
            <li> Puts my bronzer on smoothly and even.  </li>
            <li> I would give 1 star, but it was free.  </li>
            <li> Upon opening the package in the 2nd picture with the plastic cap that was holding the brush head into place, I knew I was getting a great item when I saw that.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because it&#x27;s just not as dense as the Moprhe brush, but it is still a great brush.</li>
            <li> I received this a few weeks ago and it is a great foundation brush!</li>
            <li> Applied foundation so smoothly.</li>
            <li> Completely smooth application.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would actually be free</li>
            <li> I received this brush free as a promotion and have been using it for over a month.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied witht the quality of this brush; it is good as blush brush, but not dense enough as a foundation brush, hence the 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Feeling of Brushes are better than I used so I can do better make up Thanks.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to stop swirling on my face because it felt so good and soft.</li>
            <li> Really the best thing short of airbrushing!</li>
            <li> I got the brush about 3 weeks ago but didn&#x27;t give a feedback right away as I want to be sure I&#x27;d give an accurate assessment of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is very comparable to higher end brushes, and I could not be more pleased with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Just as good as the Sigma flat top kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> Soo soft and easy to use !!</li>
            <li> I immediatly thought this was going to be another cheap brush and wasnt too excited to use it.</li>
            <li> When I got the brush I loved it; it was nice and soft and the perfect firmness, and it still is, only the metal is now loose from the wood handle and it feels like it&#x27;s going to fall apart any day.  </li>
            <li> and I hope the production of eye makeup brushes for blending eyeshadow and eyeliner and also brushes for facial contor , excellent and high quality, but I do not see kabuki brushes set with cupholder ,,&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying a foundation brush, and I really love this brush.</li>
            <li> I am more interested in quality than quantity, so the items that I use that are subjected to &amp;#34;daily wear and tear&amp;#34; must &amp;#34;stand the test of time&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> When I first received this brush I made sure to clean it so it would up to the challenge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with Lamora&#x27;s Flat top kabuki, especially since I washed it again for use tomorrow and still not shedding!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried and tested some of brush sets personally and by far this is one of the best one I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I bought two anticipating issues or having to clean it all the time</li>
            <li> I just love this Flat Top Kabuki Brush!</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and dense and blend wonderfully; I love them!</li>
            <li> The Flat Kabuki blended my BB Cream beautifully, and none of the product got sucked into the brush making it super easy and fast the clean.</li>
            <li> it arrived very quickly, and it&#x27;s just the right size for applying and blending my bb cream and foundation.  </li>
            <li> When I compared it to the sigma f80 flat top kabuki brush this one is just as amazing and cheaper.</li>
            <li> The flat , rounded top kind.  </li>
            <li> , this is more dense than other brush, and work really good with my liquid</li>
            <li> Holds minimal color in the bristles and great application.</li>
            <li> this brush is amazing quality and its soft..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind leaving reviews but the seller really emailed a lot more than I appreciate, asking for reviews or advertising their products.</li>
            <li> Love it makes my makeup look much smoother.</li>
            <li> a full review will be on my blog soon.</li>
            <li> much I bought 2 more.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive my full purchase.</li>
            <li> Now, just let me say I was kinda hesitant to use this brush because my absolute favorite foundation brush is my Morphe 439.</li>
            <li> Nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Not bad at all for price.</li>
            <li> I love it, its soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li> So easy to use and soft on my face :)</li>
            <li> Exactly as they described and shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> Super soft and easy to use:)</li>
            <li> and I feel it goes on much better than my older brushes.</li>
            <li> Super dense,</li>
            <li> Super buy.</li>
            <li> Also quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I really like that they are marked on each brush what each one is for as I can easily look up what they were designed to do by reading their (PDF download)after my purchase which provides more detailed information on each brush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in love withe the Lamora Beauty Foundation Flat Top Kabuki Brush.</li>
            <li> The Lamora flat top kabuki brush is top notch.</li>
            <li> I just received  my Lamora flat top brush and i absolutely  LOVE</li>
            <li> I started using this brush to buff out the streaks, and I got compliments on the smoothness of my makeup the very first time I tried it.</li>
            <li> The shipping was very fast!</li>
            <li> Like it very much !</li>
            <li> OK, yes, I received a free flat top kabuki from Lamora, but I really do like it!</li>
            <li> I saw the ad for this brush on Facebook and was drawn in by the fact that it would be free for the first 50 or so people to click on it.</li>
            <li> Im new to makeup and love it..</li>
            <li> Love my new foundation brush, it works just like I am using it to paint a canvas.</li>
            <li> later- loved the brush so much had to be a replacement brush!</li>
            <li> Very even application and easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love it over the foundation brush and its very soft.</li>
            <li> I received the Kabusi Facial brush (foundation) and I love it!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described!</li>
            <li> I love how natural this brush makes my foundation looks!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s super soft :)</li>
            <li> I am using SO MUCH LESS foundation than I used to use with what I was told was the best brush because it was fox fur (natural).</li>
            <li> Nice product, reasonably priced, and very soft on the face.</li>
            <li> received free as a promotion .wonderful , delivers loose powder amazingly.</li>
            <li> I waited a little bit to review this brush because I wanted to give an accurate and fair review.</li>
            <li> This brush helps smooth the product evenly over your face and blends out very well.</li>
            <li> I did receive this when they sent customers a free coupon code for this product which I really appreciate.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love how soft and sturdy the brush is.</li>
            <li> I use mine for foundation, mostly, but it&#x27;s so soft, it can be used for anything!&lt;br /&gt;Mine</li>
            <li> This creates more need for blending until application is seamless (well, its version).</li>
            <li> The brush was well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> I am loving this brush and will be purchasing the entire set.  </li>
            <li> Good brush really soft and applies foundation on very well without using too much .</li>
            <li> It is sooo darn soft that I kept touching the brush over my fingers.</li>
            <li> It gives a nice air brushed effect when I stipple and then use in a circular motion.</li>
            <li> Love this brush, soft bristles that don&#x27;t fall out</li>
            <li> I own Sigma foundation kabuki brushes and although Lamora brushes look similar, they are not as dense as my Sigma brushes.  </li>
            <li> The brush is very full and the bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that other brushes are just as good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and actually saves you money by using just the bare minimum of your mineral powders and covers flawlessly!  </li>
            <li> and I used it right away.</li>
            <li> (right now I&#x27;m using it with Tarte foundation).  </li>
            <li> But i thought since they are giving these out for free and pretty much every review i read was 5 stars</li>
            <li> Great quality brush for little cost!</li>
            <li> Highly recomended this product and these fantastic Seller</li>
            <li> I like the style of the brush and the bristles are nice and soft (So Gentle &#x27;); it&#x27;s very versatile.</li>
            <li> Price is reasonable and quick delivery.  </li>
            <li> Make up applications looks great after using this and equivalent to more expensive brushes.  </li>
            <li> For the price no one would regret spending a few $ to achieve such a flawless finish foundation application.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much smoother and more natural my foundation looks with this brush.</li>
            <li> So soft &amp; easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and applies foundation smoothly.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I was very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Works really well blending out product and gives a nice,  air-brushed finish (I am using it with BB cream as opposed to regular liquid foundation, but I&#x27;ve heard it works even better with the latter).</li>
            <li> And, the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Delivery came very fast.</li>
            <li> thanks so much!!</li>
            <li> I find that the &amp;#34;real techniques&amp;#34; flat top stippling brush is much better (also cheaper), since the duo fibres help release more of the make up onto your skin without being held and trapped in the brush.</li>
            <li> After using it for a little over a week, and after 2 washes, it still looks as good and feels like it did the first day I received it.</li>
            <li> Will purchase more of these in the future.</li>
            <li> It would be even better if it had a smaller size of brush.</li>
            <li> It is my first foundation brush, and it works a lot better than regular sponges or puffs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It  is  first  time  </li>
            <li> I love the way it applies both powder and liquid; especially the liquid (it leave no streaky marks).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and applies my foundation so smoothly.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I washed the brush first with my mac brush cleaner since it says to wash before using.</li>
            <li> I have used this brush a few times and find that it is a pretty good brush for the price.  </li>
            <li> I dab it on until most of the foundation is applied, then I do some blending with the same brush.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty durable</li>
            <li> I have been buy expensive brushes from mac but the one is wonderful.</li>
            <li> would recommend as alternative to higher end brushes like sigma f80.</li>
            <li> First foundation brush I have used.</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> No weird bleeding dyes or bristles falling out during the washing process and the smell went away</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more brushes by this brand.</li>
            <li> Fast service!</li>
            <li> Given the dual tone of the bristles, I thought this brush would be duo fibre, but the bristles are just dyed white at the top.</li>
            <li> Not only do I love my brush</li>
            <li> I was looking for another flat top Kabuki brush after my Sigma F80 basically fell apart.  </li>
            <li> The lamora foundation flat top brush was just delivered to me</li>
            <li> The bristles are not dense but flimsey, unlike a Kabuki Flat top brush should be.  </li>
            <li> Better than sponges, fingers, or flat brushes for application.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had experience with more expensive versions of this, but it seems to do a good job of applying my foundation</li>
            <li> This poses a problem because at times I tend to apply my eyeshadows and brow application before foundation and you cannot get into certain areas unless you really pinch the tip of the bristles, because it&#x27;s so flared!</li>
            <li> My handle fell off on the bottom half but that is ok because the part I need is what works!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The number of positive feedbacks, the promotional offer, and most importantly, to save money from having to shell out for a second Shiseido brush as backup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this brush for a period of two weeks prior to submitting my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I own Sigma, Sephora, mac, mineral fusion and other more expensive brushes, but I must say that I am very pleased with my Lamora brushes.  </li>
            <li> I mainly use it for a more sheer coverage and ALWAYS press it into the skin with the foundation.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience using a brush to use after putting liquid foundation and it made a huge difference in the overall appearance of my makeup.  </li>
            <li> Knocking off one star only because there is definitely a strong odor once you take off the packaging and took 2-3 washes with baby shampoo to fully get that smell gone.  </li>
            <li> If you are a makeup/brush conesseiour, you can make it work to a certain degree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Soft and very gentle!</li>
            <li> The handle is very sturdy and the brush is super soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> In all honestly I thought that it was just going to be just another &amp;#34;Amazon&amp;#34; make up brush that was going to be cheap &amp; be harsh on my skin when used, but I was VERY surprised upon receiving it how SOFT yet STURDY the brush was.</li>
            <li> The brush is also fluffy and super easy to use for those applying foundation with a brush for the first time.</li>
            <li> The brush itself is ok, nothing special, the handle is too long for my personal taste.</li>
            <li> Amazing quality for such a low price...</li>
            <li> I use this brush to apply my cream foundation and it blends very well giving my face an airbrush affect.  </li>
            <li> It has held up very well and no bristles have fallen out.</li>
            <li> my foundation very well</li>
            <li> Works really well.  </li>
            <li> how fast this gif to me.</li>
            <li> but that isn&#x27;t really a problem.</li>
            <li> For the price point, I&#x27;d like to compare this with the Real Techniques Expert Face Brush.</li>
            <li> Really was amazed by this brush.</li>
            <li> Thanks lamora beauty for this brush.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it (with my normal make up)</li>
            <li> I gave 4 stars because for the time I had it performed very well.</li>
            <li> High quality!</li>
            <li> and I really endorse this Kabuki brush from Lamora Beauty on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It really passed the test.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush for applying my foundations.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use my Real Technique and  Estee Lauder brushes anymore.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Lamora</li>
            <li> Sucks up my product And doesn&#x27;t really apply product good</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to buy a sigma brush for a long time but honestly, these feel the exact same as sigma.</li>
            <li> I use it for both my liquid and powder foundation and barely have to use any for that full coverage look.</li>
            <li> Or for mature clients who prefer a more sheer and matte coverage.</li>
            <li> This brush is worth buying, it feels amazing in my skin too why didn&#x27;t I found this a long time ago.arrived fast on expected promised day.</li>
            <li> Having lighter tips it is much easier to clean as you can see the makeup stains and how deep it goes.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic flat brush for applying foundation .  </li>
            <li> Hopefully there&#x27;s more sales for their other brushes soon.</li>
            <li> I will stick with my other favorite one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and works as just as good as the one from Sigma that I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I use it every day, and really helps use less product, with a much better finish.</li>
            <li> So far its pretty sturdy, well put together.</li>
            <li> Awesome brush, and the same quality as the other one I have that was more expensive.  </li>
            <li> The flat top is great for the planes of the face, and the tips of the bristles are small enough that contoured facial areas are covered too.  </li>
            <li> As soon as the larger set gets back in stock, I will be buying more of these.  </li>
            <li> Very soft and makes application much easier.</li>
            <li> So I wasnt too sure about this brush since i only like to use name brand brushes such as mac and high end brushes.</li>
            <li> This u a fabulous product that does not shed or loose it&#x27;s shape.</li>
            <li> Thank you for an affordable yet high quality product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to pay $30+ for a high end brush</li>
            <li> Highly recommended product.</li>
            <li> and I have high standards.</li>
            <li> This is now my go to brush, I highly recommend this brush for your BB cream, foundation, powder, etc.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for my Bare Minerals Bareskin liquid foundation at less then half the price (I bought it on a one-day markdown) of the Bare Minerals brush that is sold for that purpose.</li>
            <li> It is very soft and cleaning it 1 x every week, at least every two weeks really keeps the brush fresh and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The application is gentle and extremely soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably going to get a few more from this line soon.</li>
            <li> But for the price point normally I would repurchase either way.</li>
            <li> I did notice that my Sigma brush is just slightly more dense and to make sure that I gave it a true comparison, I did half my face with Sigma and the other half With Lamora.</li>
            <li> Dense enough for full coverage, lush and soft!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly new to make up</li>
            <li> and so I decided to try something new.</li>
            <li> The brush is very soft.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft when applying to my face.  </li>
            <li> Makeup looks very  natural.</li>
            <li> Bristles are very soft and brush is well made.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and none of the bristles came out after washing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft, although it isn&#x27;t as dense as it looks.</li>
            <li> Super luxe and doesn&#x27;t loose hairs.  </li>
            <li> It is extremely soft but very good at applying the makeup I have tired it on both powder and of a powder type wet makeup.</li>
            <li> The next time I need something I will check here first.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve used a sponge to apply my makeup but recently switched to a higher end foundation and the sales woman recommended the Kabuiki.</li>
            <li> The bristles ARE SO SOFT!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just so soft!</li>
            <li> Only when i washed it that first time.</li>
            <li> My friend has the Sigma F80 and this is pretty similar!</li>
            <li> They preformed EXACTLY the same!!!</li>
            <li> though the Lamora brush isn&#x27;t as dense as the Sigma F80, I still received the exact same results!</li>
            <li> Ordered as gift for significant other.</li>
            <li> I did purchase the entire 10 brush set on September 30, 2014, but for some reason, I can&#x27;t leave a review on it because I bought this one brush first, and it didn&#x27;t allow me to leave THAT review.  </li>
            <li> if not better but might not have as many ratings because the company does not incessantly pester their customers to leave a review.</li>
            <li> Plus, I am using less foundation since it blends the coverage smooth and evenly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended and worth the money.i will purchase other products.</li>
            <li> The next day when the brush was dry i used it with my cream foundation and this smoothed my foundation on so smoothly and evenly</li>
            <li> I never used a Lamora product before and certainly will in the future,</li>
            <li> I do that trick of dotting my face really fast with it (forget the term) and with so little make up, I get so much coverage and so fast.</li>
            <li> I find that the bristles are a bit stiff and not as comfortable as other brushes that I have, but it is not a bad thing.  </li>
            <li> This brush is velvety soft and dense enough to hold and blend product very well.</li>
            <li> The brush is so soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this wasn&#x27;t made out of dog hair from China.</li>
            <li> This brush applies foundation smooth and with a few strokes.</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft and doesn&#x27;t shed at all.</li>
            <li> The brush is so soft.</li>
            <li> I plan on buying the whole set as soon as they bring it back.</li>
            <li> It is also SOOO Soft.</li>
            <li> It is so soft and does buffer well.</li>
            <li> Bristles remained soft and fluffy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> That one is smaller but really dense.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s think and soft</li>
            <li> far i like it,  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised with this brush.</li>
            <li> It is soft.</li>
            <li> The bristles are so soft</li>
            <li> This Lamora brush is a very close second.</li>
            <li> Used the brush a couple times and like it a lot so far.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so soft and distributes my foundation so well and evenly.</li>
            <li> Its so soft and applies foundation so well.</li>
            <li> It is incredibly soft and works wonders.</li>
            <li> They are sooooo soft,</li>
            <li> Its really soft.</li>
            <li> This brush is dense, soft, and hasn&#x27;t shed a bristle.</li>
            <li> I am not a make-up artist, but I like durable, soft, dense, and shed-free brushes.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve have purchased from this company before and had a bad experience with the 8 brush set (I will say their customer service was amazing), but this particular brush is actually pretty well made!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why the standard foundation brush is even still being used by most people when a brush like this exists.</li>
            <li> Who would not love a FREE BRUSH</li>
            <li> It rinses easily, too; I use a very mild soap to wash mine, with hot tap water, rinse in cold water, and the bristles are dry in several hours.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i was little hesitate to order  flat top Kabuki, because 6 piece set has almost same size Kabuki...</li>
            <li> The following day I experimented with my new tool with optimism...</li>
            <li> I actually prefer to use this over the new Sigma 3dhd Kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> Im interested in trying this brands other brushes.</li>
            <li> It applies a little bit better with a tinted moisturizer versus foundation which appears to weigh down the tip of the bristles causing that streaky effect.</li>
            <li> Wow - my only regret is not buying this brush sooner!</li>
            <li> The brush isn&#x27;t too large, as some other kabuki brushes, so it works well with mineral make-up.</li>
            <li> By this I mean, you are not getting a cheap product.</li>
            <li> I used pretty much same amount as I would with my other foundation</li>
            <li> bristles are too soft and not tapered enough, which causes them to fold in every which direction without proper precision.</li>
            <li> I use this especially for younger clients(highschool prom photos, young bridesmaids.)</li>
            <li> The bristles are high quality which will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> My only concern is that I&#x27;ve had my Sigma F80 for MUCH longer, and the handle on this one is already loose despite the fact that I wash them the same way.</li>
            <li> However, not sure if it was the BB cream or the brush, but it seemed like the BB cream wasn&#x27;t absorbed on skin</li>
            <li> I am highly considering all of the other brushes for my kit.</li>
            <li> There were a few loose hairs the first time I used it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not huge into doing makeup - I mainly just watch YouTube videos</li>
            <li> Being a girl with dark spots , and having trouble finding the right brush to help coverage this one does the trick.</li>
            <li> I would recommend a flat brush to anyone</li>
            <li> Just  received the new  KABUKI brush by Lamora a few days ago and I  have to give it five stars.</li>
            <li> , I let it air dry overnight and used it the next day.  </li>
            <li> itself is soft to skin but firm enough to apply the make up</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely firm but soft at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i had few set of Lamora brushes past few month, and i like them more and more,,,&lt;br</li>
            <li> The regular price of this brush is still less than the Bare Minerals one.</li>
            <li> They are difficult to clean sometimes when used regularly for liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> They are comparable and significantly less expensive than the other brushes that I own and if you are about quality, I would recommend Lamora.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> bristles are softer than other similar brushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> think I will buy other brushes from this company in the future.</li>
            <li> It gives my combination skin an airbrushed look, covering up my acne and dry spots.</li>
            <li> I have only had it a few months, and though I have cleaned the brush, I have only cleaned the part that touches the makeup</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t recall losing a single hair - yet.  </li>
            <li> I actually use less make up with this brush.  </li>
            <li> Only thing is it is not as big as I had hoped...a small 1 1/2 inch in diameter for the bristle end of the brush....</li>
            <li> and it was so wet that I&#x27;d have to wait or blow dry my face to move forward</li>
            <li> The only thing i didnt like was that it was shedding a little when i washed it.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry if you purchase this high quality brush!!!</li>
            <li> I own plenty of expensive brushes and let me just tell you this Kabuki brush is not a cheaply made, hard or hurting on your face when applied.</li>
            <li> Its a great investment, I guarantee you YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!</li>
            <li> My only (slightly) negative is that the picture used to show the brush shows 2 brushes and in reality there is only 1 brush.</li>
            <li> The only negative is the actual website of the manufacturer which need to be updated.</li>
            <li> I have a few Sigma Brushes, and I must say, these are VERY VERY similar.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this brush to use as foundation brush, but it is not as dense as I expected.</li>
            <li> The bristles are thick and soft.</li>
            <li> The head is a little smaller than some of my other ones</li>
            <li> Only use a little since a little goes a long way with this brush.</li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way when using this brush also.</li>
            <li> To reiterate, this is due to the brush not being sufficiently tapered.</li>
            <li> The brush is not the quality I expected, I will stick to Sigma for now!</li>
            <li> The barrel has the logo Lamora inscribed on it and the name of the brush and number on the other side.</li>
            <li> So you have to be very careful using this on powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s very minimal shedding, but I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> and it was never submerged in water to destroy the glue (I made that mistake with an eye makeup brush a few years back).  </li>
            <li> need less powder then with other brushes.</li>
            <li> it took a lot less makeup to use and blended well.</li>
            <li> It did shed just a tinsy bit (less than the pricy mac brushes though)</li>
            <li> You use WAY less liquid foundation with this brush.</li>
            <li> Baby shampoo and sometimes a little Dawn dish soap do the trick for me though.</li>
            <li> brush smelled a little when I received it</li>
            <li> When I applied my makeup with the brush I was extremely overwhelmed by the coverage it did and the bristles didnt feel like it was in my pores!!</li>
            <li> I have now officially put my other kabuki brushes to sleep, forever!!</li>
            <li> MUST TRY THIS BEFORE ORDERING ANY OTHER BRAND!!</li>
            <li> I received the brush within a few days of ordering.  </li>
            <li> I washed it and it dried over night which was a plus</li>
            <li> I have been using it a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Mostly, I am very frustrated that this company would send SO many emails after my purchase.</li>
            <li> It uses very little liquid foundation to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> No more shedding.</li>
            <li> You will forever be sorry after the next use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually use beauty blender when using cream foundation</li>
            <li> This is not a compliment I usually get.</li>
            <li> I have all the expensive brushes; this ,now, is the only one I use for foundation.</li>
            <li> Use this everyday!</li>
            <li> I also found that since the bristles were too densely packed, it took longer for me to buff and blend liquid foundation since the brush felt very stiff</li>
            <li> The brush was hard and does not apply as well as my MAC brush did.</li>
            <li> If this brush would have lasted longer, I would have probably slowly began switching out some of my bareminerals brushes and replacing with brushes from this company.</li>
            <li> I do think the price was a little expensive for one brush.</li>
            <li> Definitely buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I wash my brushes weekly and have not experienced any fallout of bristles.</li>
            <li> When pressed on the skin it didn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;pokey&amp;#34; nor irritating.</li>
            <li> I did not ever sign up to be on an email list, so I feel that this was unnecessary.</li>
            <li> I did receive this brush with a promotional discount which made me skeptical about the quality</li>
            <li> They should have asked whether I wanted to be signed up for emails...and not all of their emails even include an &amp;#34;unsubscribe&amp;#34; link, so I was confused as to how I would even stop receiving them!</li>
            <li> Take my word for it, because I was skeptical like you are now!</li>
            <li> i was shocked.</li>
            <li> I have used it for both powder and liquid base.</li>
            <li> i hated using brushes for foundation until i met this brush.</li>
            <li> --I hated it.</li>
            <li> Obsessed!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The brush itself is ok, nothing special, the handle is too long for my personal taste. I don&#x27;t mind leaving reviews but the seller really emailed a lot more than I appreciate, asking for reviews or advertising their products.</li>
            <li> I have a few Sigma Brushes, and I must say, these are VERY VERY similar. Will purchase more of these in the future. Applies product well, and easy clean up.</li>
            <li> I got it on sale for about $12. It worked well for me. I used it with liquid foundation as well as powder.</li>
            <li> This is the best foundation brush I ever had, I recommend it to anybody</li>
            <li> My girlfriend is so happy and amazed with the brush that is asking me to buy her more like this</li>
            <li> Everything I expected.  Feels so smooth on my face</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush to use as foundation brush, but it is not as dense as I expected. So I used this instead as my blush brush. The brush is so soft. I am satisfied witht the quality of this brush; it is good as blush brush, but not dense enough as a foundation brush, hence the 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! No more shedding.</li>
            <li> I was considering getting a more expensive brush (a Morphs or Sigma) but I was really thrilled to find this one that works just as well at a much lower cost. Works really well blending out product and gives a nice,  air-brushed finish (I am using it with BB cream as opposed to regular liquid foundation, but I&#x27;ve heard it works even better with the latter). I&#x27;m probably going to get a few more from this line soon. Also, great customer service.</li>
            <li> Love it. It&#x27;s so soft</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li> good!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Great brush. Soft and very gentle!</li>
            <li> Kinda sticky but I&#x27;m going to wash it and see if it loosens up some more.</li>
            <li> Softest bristle brushes i have ever felt..superb application. .purchase comes with makeup tips...the gift to yourself that keeps on giving as you put your best face forward!  Looking for more products asap!</li>
            <li> This brush applies my makeup flawlessly. It leaves me with an airbrush finish whether Using cream or liquid foundation. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Never used a brush before to apply my foundation and now that I have this brush I will never stop. I love it, thanks so much!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in love withe the Lamora Beauty Foundation Flat Top Kabuki Brush. It buffs my foundation in so smoothly and my make up looks air brushed and flawless... Love love love this brush!!!!</li>
            <li> It is a Christmas gift for my granddaughter.</li>
            <li> My wife loved this brush.</li>
            <li> The Lamora flat top kabuki brush is top notch. I use this brush to apply my cream foundation and it blends very well giving my face an airbrush affect.  Plus, I am using less foundation since it blends the coverage smooth and evenly. The brush is very soft.</li>
            <li> My first kabuki brush because I just switched to foundation from powder and heard about this being best to apply makeup with. I love how soft and sturdy the brush is. It applies the way I like it to so I can&#x27;t complain. :)</li>
            <li> This brush is worth buying, it feels amazing in my skin too why didn&#x27;t I found this a long time ago.arrived fast on expected promised day.Highly recomended this product and these fantastic Seller</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried and tested some of brush sets personally and by far this is one of the best one I would recommend to anyone. It comes with a hard case which is very nice and handy and it also looks very great. It would be even better if it had a smaller size of brush. Other than that, I was very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love this kabuki brush for my foundation still love it</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS BRUSH!!!! Super luxe and doesn&#x27;t loose hairs.  Holds minimal color in the bristles and great application. Will buy more of these.</li>
            <li> Str8 to the point..Works like a sigma f80.. Im new to makeup and love it..</li>
            <li> Amazing amazing brush. It is extremely soft but very good at applying the makeup I have tired it on both powder and of a powder type wet makeup. It worked well applied flawlessly and makes you look like your makeup was professionally done. It made my face look perfect it took a lot less makeup to use and blended well. Made me look like I had no acne or scars on my face and covered everything evenly and well. I am so happy I received this brush as a gift to share my experiences with it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this brush! I use mine for foundation, mostly, but it&#x27;s so soft, it can be used for anything!&lt;br /&gt;Mine still hasn&#x27;t shed, and it&#x27;s very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it feels when you hold it, very smooth and light.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these brushes to anyone!</li>
            <li> love it, its perfect for foundation. its spreads foundation perfectly best thing ever.</li>
            <li> The bristles are high quality which will last a very long time.  The feel of the bristles are awesome.  My face product goes on so nice with this brush.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I love that the bristles are so compact and it helps it blend powder foundation so smoothly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush for 3 reasons:&lt;br /&gt;The number of positive feedbacks, the promotional offer, and most importantly, to save money from having to shell out for a second Shiseido brush as backup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this brush for a period of two weeks prior to submitting my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush came in your standard plastic enclosed packaging, tucked into a minola envelope. I did not notice any distinct smell, which was great! Upon closer inspection of the bristles, I began to have some doubts on its capabilities. Nonetheless, I washed it without experiencing any shedding. Yay!! The following day I experimented with my new tool with optimism... Oyy!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some of the downfalls of this brush:&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are too soft and not tapered enough, which causes them to fold in every which direction without proper precision. You have to hold the bristles (not handle) midway in order to make attempts at creating a flawless finish. If not, it will appear a bit streaky. This creates more need for blending until application is seamless (well, its version). It applies a little bit better with a tinted moisturizer versus foundation which appears to weigh down the tip of the bristles causing that streaky effect. Another thing that irks me is how flared it is. To reiterate, this is due to the brush not being sufficiently tapered. This poses a problem because at times I tend to apply my eyeshadows and brow application before foundation and you cannot get into certain areas unless you really pinch the tip of the bristles, because it&#x27;s so flared! I&#x27;ve started using it for blush applications. An additional downside is the cleaning requirement after every use. If you decide to skip this step... Oh boy! You will forever be sorry after the next use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your someone with blemishes or new to makeup, invest in a great foundation brush to get the most natural look and great coverage application. If you are a makeup/brush conesseiour, you can make it work to a certain degree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this brush has great potential if improvements are made.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not huge into doing makeup - I mainly just watch YouTube videos but this brush works great with the liquid NARS foundation I just bought. 10/10 would recommend. Good quality and the bristles are so soft!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this brush!!  My foundation goes on so flawless!  Can&#x27;t beat the price either!!</li>
            <li> Great brush and a great price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2years later- loved the brush so much had to be a replacement brush!</li>
            <li> I like the brush, it is good quality. My only (slightly) negative is that the picture used to show the brush shows 2 brushes and in reality there is only 1 brush. The price is fair for the one brush. The next time I need something I will check here first.</li>
            <li> Student led classroom!</li>
            <li> I like this brush. I&#x27;m an esthitican and use this for personal use daily. I would recommend to clients and friends. Bristles have not come out. It washes well and holds its shape.</li>
            <li> The best foundation brush I have ever use I love itðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> Just  received the new  KABUKI brush by Lamora a few days ago and I  have to give it five stars. It is amazing . It delivers flawless results from the very first use. You don&#x27;t have to learn how to use this brush  because it is effortless . I own the Mac 192  and 132 foundation brush and there is no comparison ,the Lamora brush blows the Mac brushes away .  I didn&#x27;t think my foundation could look this good. Thank you Lamora for making such an excellent brush and for making it so affordable . I will be ordering the entire set .</li>
            <li> I received the Kabusi Facial brush (foundation) and I love it! It&#x27;s turned into my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Item and can&#x27;t believe all the time I didn&#x27;t  have one. Thank you and your service was&lt;br /&gt;5 Star Great...Ci</li>
            <li> I love this brush. For years I&#x27;ve used a sponge to apply my makeup but recently switched to a higher end foundation and the sales woman recommended the Kabuiki. I wasn&#x27;t prepared to pay $35+ at the makeup store for a brush. Glad I found this one on Amazon at a great price!</li>
            <li> I get awesome coverage with this brush. I love it!</li>
            <li> This kabuki brush is wonderful for blending my foundation! I&#x27;m so happy I purchased it (almost bought the Sigma Kabuki but decided to give this a try) and I bought another for my sister... She LOVES it as well! I have had this product for 2+ months and have had no fall out! Dense enough for full coverage, lush and soft! Thank you for an affordable yet high quality product.</li>
            <li> The brush was great up until I cleaned it.  The bristles started to move and distorted it&#x27;s shape.  I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this wasn&#x27;t made out of dog hair from China.</li>
            <li> I just received  my Lamora flat top brush and i absolutely  LOVE IT. I use liquid foundation and when i was done i looked airbrushed. This is a must have brush makeup lovers ladies and gents.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing brush! Loved it.</li>
            <li> Awesome brush for putting on foundation</li>
            <li> A great brush my foundation and powder  goes on perfect</li>
            <li> I love this brush for putting on blush/bronzer. It has held up very well and no bristles have fallen out. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love these make up brushes.  I was lucky to be able to try it complimentary for a honest and unbiased opinion.  This brush is great for putting on my mineral make up.  I also like to use it with my powder and blush.  The bristles are very soft when applying to my face.  I actually use less make up with this brush.  I am really enjoying using it.</li>
            <li> Best foudation brush i ever bought ...love it best. bristles  do not fall out everytime I wash it .</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It applies my foundation flawlessly. Easy to clean, no fall out. I own sigma and real techniques brushes and this one is just as good. And you can&#x27;t beat the price!!!</li>
            <li> This brush applies foundation smooth and with a few strokes. Very even application and easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;I love it</li>
            <li> I love it, its soft and easy to use. I used it with YSL Eclat foundation, and the coverage was even, smooth all over the face.  I used pretty much same amount as I would with my other foundation brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does it compare with my regular foundation brush? The flat , rounded top kind.  This flat kabuki is much better , giving better coverage.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t washed it yet, so I don&#x27;t know how it will hold up, but I will update if needed.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this brush .. Soo soft and easy to use !! A must have !!</li>
            <li> Sucks up my product And doesn&#x27;t really apply product good</li>
            <li> Awesome, soft... Even application. Love it</li>
            <li> Love it .blends my foundation very well</li>
            <li> Great brush, incredibly soft and buffs very nicely.  Knocking off one star only because there is definitely a strong odor once you take off the packaging and took 2-3 washes with baby shampoo to fully get that smell gone.  Otherwise very pleased!</li>
            <li> Great brush for foundation and it&#x27;s super soft :) Easy to clean and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my face.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with my purchase.  Price is reasonable and quick delivery.  I was looking for another flat top Kabuki brush after my Sigma F80 basically fell apart.  I was somewhat nervous about ordering this one but have been very pleased and will order again.</li>
            <li> This Kabuki brush is the best foundation brush I have ever used!! I love what it does..it leaves your face looking flawless, even and air brushed..I have gotten compliments on my skin ever since I started using this brush. I let the people know it&#x27;s the brush I&#x27;ve been using. So far its pretty sturdy, well put together. After I&#x27;m done using it and I wash it, I like to leave it in the plastic it came with to keep it in its place, I&#x27;ve had it for two weeks now. I will definitely be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Makes foundation application so effortless!  Love the smooth, flawless results!</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft and doesn&#x27;t shed at all. I&#x27;m impressed by this brand time and time again!</li>
            <li> Love it! I&#x27;m not sure why the standard foundation brush is even still being used by most people when a brush like this exists. This should be the ONLY brush anyone uses for foundation application. It falls somewhere in between the light application/blending from a sponge, but the ability to build that you get from a--yuck--regular foundation brush. Never using anything but this ever again!</li>
            <li> Very good brush, pick up product nicely and glides product smoothly on the face</li>
            <li> Wonderful brush!  smooths foundation on evenly ..Looks great</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I&#x27;m fairly new to make up and I had been using  those cheap sponge applicators and so I decided to try something new. I can totally tell the difference in the way my foundation sets. My foundation looks way better with this brush.</li>
            <li> Love it makes my makeup look much smoother.</li>
            <li> Works really well.  Great item at a great price.</li>
            <li> I love it,its the deal for my fondation</li>
            <li> It is my first foundation brush, and it works a lot better than regular sponges or puffs.&lt;br /&gt;It helps the liquid foundation to stay on my skin and easy to blend colors as well.&lt;br /&gt;Brush itself is soft to skin but firm enough to apply the make up easily.&lt;br /&gt;But, I have not yet figure out is best way to store it after each use.</li>
            <li> Love  this brush. It  is  first  time  I  am  using  a  brush  for  liquid  makeup. It works great. Makeup looks very  natural.</li>
            <li> Softest brush ever. I love it!</li>
            <li> Perfect for applying foundation</li>
            <li> very good quality..i love it..</li>
            <li> Who would not love a FREE BRUSH</li>
            <li> i hated using brushes for foundation until i met this brush. I didn&#x27;t want to pay $30+ for a high end brush and this one works perfectly for it&#x27;s price. 10/10 would purchase again</li>
            <li> Awesome brush!  Will certainly by more.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing. I use cover girl Aqua Smooth makeup in the compact but the applicator sponge that comes with it leaves streaks all over my face. I started using this brush to buff out the streaks, and I got compliments on the smoothness of my makeup the very first time I tried it. Great value for money.</li>
            <li> I was literally in shock how fast this gif to me. The product it&#x27;s self is amazing. I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I have only used once and am please switch results. Good brush and covers well</li>
            <li> I was very impressed when I got this brush. it was longer than my kabuki brush I got from Mary kay. It also has softer bristles and feels like a feather on my face. Having lighter tips it is much easier to clean as you can see the makeup stains and how deep it goes. I received this item at a discount and that has no bias in my review. I have used this all week with powdered makeup and I feel it goes on much better than my older brushes.</li>
            <li> I will start by saying I did receive a discounted price on this brush. Now let&#x27;s move on from that. When I first received this brush I made sure to clean it so it would up to the challenge. I like the style of the brush and the bristles are nice and soft (So Gentle &#x27;); it&#x27;s very versatile. I personally love to use it as a foundation brush. I love the way it applies both powder and liquid; especially the liquid (it leave no streaky marks). So basically it&#x27;s  a great brush for an awesome price!</li>
            <li> Great brush. Very soft and makes application much easier.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I was using a popular blender sponge before trying this brush, and I am so much happier with this for my liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> I recieved the brush in the mail today. I decided to used it. Omgosh! The brush is so soft. It&#x27;s application causes my imperfections disappear. I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> All i have to say is I AM SO IN LOVE WITH IT .. I use it to apply liquid foundation and it works great!</li>
            <li> One of the best makeup brushes I have ever used. Exactly as they described and shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> Bristles are very soft and brush is well made.  I use it as a stippling brush for perfect foundation application.  It&#x27;s comparable to high-end makeup brushes, but for a better price!  I&#x27;m very happy with this brush....excellent value!</li>
            <li> The BEST BRUSH EVER!!!&lt;br /&gt;I Highly recommend it , it is so smooth , it gives you a flawless skin after my makeup application&lt;br /&gt;I just LOVE it !!!!!</li>
            <li> I just received this brush and so far I&#x27;m loving it! The bristles ARE SO SOFT! a full review will be on my blog soon. Thefashionfondue.com. Check it out !</li>
            <li> Nice product, reasonably priced, and very soft on the face.</li>
            <li> This quickly became my favorite foundation brush!</li>
            <li> This brush works perfectly with Bare Minerals Ready foundation. I haven&#x27;t used it with a liquid foundation yet but I bet it would work. It&#x27;s very soft. There were a few loose hairs the first time I used it but I haven&#x27;t had any more fall out since. The shipping was very fast!</li>
            <li> The brush was well worth the price.  The bristles don&#x27;t fall out, it is sturdy and make-up goes on smoothly, without caking.  The brush isn&#x27;t too large, as some other kabuki brushes, so it works well with mineral make-up. I never used a Lamora product before and certainly will in the future,</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for a family member,,, she loves it.</li>
            <li> Amazing brush! It&#x27;s so soft and applies my foundation so smoothly. I plan on buying the whole set as soon as they bring it back. It&#x27;s a great piece to have in your collection.</li>
            <li> received free as a promotion .wonderful , delivers loose powder amazingly. need less powder then with other brushes. I gave 4 because  it is pricey</li>
            <li> The best brushes I have ever owned. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Really good brush. I like to use it for liquid foundation. The head is a little smaller than some of my other ones but that isn&#x27;t really a problem. It&#x27;s soft and works as just as good as the one from Sigma that I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Ok, so far so good. I like to write my reviews after I have used the product for a while.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a good quality brush.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent brush.  The flat top is great for the planes of the face, and the tips of the bristles are small enough that contoured facial areas are covered too.  It rinses easily, too; I use a very mild soap to wash mine, with hot tap water, rinse in cold water, and the bristles are dry in several hours.  The brush holds its shape, which is another plus.  I would definitely buy products from this company again.  And, the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and dense and blend wonderfully; I love them! They are difficult to clean sometimes when used regularly for liquid foundation. Baby shampoo and sometimes a little Dawn dish soap do the trick for me though. No shedding at all and I&#x27;ve used mine every day for months. Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this brush! Well worth the money spent. That and it&#x27;s just so soft! Squee!</li>
            <li> This is the absolute most greatest brush out there. If you are looking for a brush that compares to the Sigma F80 - Let me tell you, you are going to love this one!!!!! Definitely buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. It is also SOOO Soft. Take my word for it, because I was skeptical like you are now!</li>
            <li> So I wasnt too sure about this brush since i only like to use name brand brushes such as mac and high end brushes. But i thought since they are giving these out for free and pretty much every review i read was 5 stars so thought i would give it a try. I washed the brush first with my mac brush cleaner since it says to wash before using. The only thing i didnt like was that it was shedding a little when i washed it. I immediatly thought this was going to be another cheap brush and wasnt too excited to use it. The next day when the brush was dry i used it with my cream foundation and this smoothed my foundation on so smoothly and evenly i was shocked. It didnt shed at all. Only when i washed it that first time. I loved the results of the brush and love it over my mac foundation brush. Today i tried using it with liquid foundation. Only use a little since a little goes a long way with this brush. It worked so well. I havent tried it with powders yet but im amazed at how good this brush picks up product and smooths onto your face. I love it over the foundation brush and its very soft. Im interested in trying this brands other brushes. Give it a try you wont be disapointed.</li>
            <li> I have used this brush a few times and find that it is a pretty good brush for the price.  I find that the bristles are a bit stiff and not as comfortable as other brushes that I have, but it is not a bad thing.  Make up applications looks great after using this and equivalent to more expensive brushes.  If you are looking to try out a kabuki brush, then I would definitely recommend giving this one a try.</li>
            <li> Found this brush while shopping for a different product.  I decided to try it and I am glad I did.  I received the brush within a few days of ordering.  I am loving this brush and will be purchasing the entire set.  The only negative is the actual website of the manufacturer which need to be updated.</li>
            <li> this brush is amazing quality and its soft..it blends whithin seconds with literally not touchups..lamora beauty brush &#x3D;  airbrush finish</li>
            <li> This really was an amazing purchase! I have been wanting to buy a sigma brush for a long time but honestly, these feel the exact same as sigma. It is so soft and does buffer well.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush.  My handle fell off on the bottom half but that is ok because the part I need is what works!</li>
            <li> Really great product! It arrived on time and I also received a eBook on proper care and tips! Awesome customer service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a make-up expert but will give my honest opinion based on my experience using this product. I got the brush about 3 weeks ago but didn&#x27;t give a feedback right away as I want to be sure I&#x27;d give an accurate assessment of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway overall, for the price, I thought the product is great. By this I mean, you are not getting a cheap product. It is definitely affordable, but delivers quality results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What are my basis? I used the brush using different kinds of products:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Liquid Foundation - It&#x27;s great for liquid foundation. Used it as stippling brush, then circular motion. Leaves an airbrush finish, skin flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Cream Foundation - It&#x27;s great for cream foundation. I usually use beauty blender when using cream foundation cause it&#x27;s easier to spread the foundation using it. But this brush functioned the same as the beauty blender. Leaves an airbrush finish, skin flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Powder Foundation - It was ok when used on powder foundation. Spreading the powder foundation was good but I think the brush picked up more product than needed. So you have to be very careful using this on powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. BB cream - It blended the BB cream well. However, not sure if it was the BB cream or the brush, but it seemed like the BB cream wasn&#x27;t absorbed on skin and it looked like it was just sitting on my skin and not absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cleaned the brush in between usage. There was no fallouts. Bristles remained soft and fluffy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a 4 star just cause I want it to be more dense. For the price point, I&#x27;d like to compare this with the Real Techniques Expert Face Brush. That one is smaller but really dense. If this brush would be as densed, it would be perfect. But that just my personal preference.</li>
            <li> It really does create a flawless look--I keep double glancing in the mirror--my skin looks so good! Only thing is it is not as big as I had hoped...a small 1 1/2 inch in diameter for the bristle end of the brush....I was looking to use it for powder foundation. It works, just wish it was larger.</li>
            <li> Excellent  quality and arrived very fast. Thank u!!!</li>
            <li> Have been using the Kabui Brush for almost a month and love it!</li>
            <li> The lamora foundation flat top brush was just delivered to me and I used it right away. The application of the foundation is awesome! It gives my combination skin an airbrushed look, covering up my acne and dry spots. The brush is also fluffy and super easy to use for those applying foundation with a brush for the first time. It did shed just a tinsy bit (less than the pricy mac brushes though) thus the 4 star rating but overall a solid buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.s. It works well with mousse textured foundation like the Laura Mercier silk creme foundation!</li>
            <li> By far the best foundation brush I have used. Being a girl with dark spots , and having trouble finding the right brush to help coverage this one does the trick. It&#x27;s easy to clean, and goes on smoothly. Highly recommended product.</li>
            <li> Good brush really soft and applies foundation on very well without using too much . Great customer service as well !</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my wife and she loved it and fully satisfy .A big thank you to Lamora .Quality was Awesome:)</li>
            <li> I love this make-up brushes set and I hope the production of eye makeup brushes for blending eyeshadow and eyeliner and also brushes for facial contor , excellent and high quality, but I do not see kabuki brushes set with cupholder ,,&lt;br /&gt;Have you been to stop the production of the set ?</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had experience with more expensive versions of this, but it seems to do a good job of applying my foundation (right now I&#x27;m using it with Tarte foundation).  I dab it on until most of the foundation is applied, then I do some blending with the same brush.  I&#x27;ve washed it multiple times and it&#x27;s held up well, I can&#x27;t recall losing a single hair - yet.  It&#x27;s pretty durable and I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this brush, very good quality. I use it every day, and really helps use less product, with a much better finish.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this brush.....&lt;br /&gt;So much I bought 2 more.</li>
            <li> Love the brush. Smooth all over going on</li>
            <li> Love it... works great and I love the feel of it.</li>
            <li> Really was amazed by this brush. Though its pricier than my elf powder brush but it did a better job.</li>
            <li> awesome! applies foundation well!</li>
            <li> Feeling of Brushes are better than I used so I can do better make up Thanks.</li>
            <li> Put my powder foundation on smooth and loved the feel of the brush...</li>
            <li> Works Great. I don&#x27;t have any complaints. No issues with the bristles falling out. I love it.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing! Super dense, but there&#x27;s just enough give to blend your liquid foundation perfectly. There was also zero shedding out of the package. LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Really quick delivery and brush is great. Looks and feels a lot more expensive than it was. Super buy.</li>
            <li> I waited a little bit to review this brush because I wanted to give an accurate and fair review. I did receive this brush with a promotional discount which made me skeptical about the quality but it&#x27;s actually amazing.&lt;br /&gt;No bristles came out when washing or with basic usage. It&#x27;s extremely firm but soft at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a person that uses very light makeup. Just powder for foundation and some bronzer and blush. That&#x27;s why I love kabuki brushes. This one in particular is perfect for bronzer and blush. I felt like it works better for liquid foundation versus my powder but that&#x27;s just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this brush out for a week or so to see if there was any shedding or change to the brush itself. After using it for a little over a week, and after 2 washes, it still looks as good and feels like it did the first day I received it. I am truly impressed with the construction of this brush, especially for the price! This is very comparable to higher end brushes, and I could not be more pleased with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I love , love, love this brush. I have been buy expensive brushes from mac but the one is wonderful. I does not irritate my skin and it gives a flawless finish on my face. This brush is the best brush I have ever used. For the price no one would regret spending a few $ to achieve such a flawless finish foundation application. I will order again for my mom, sisters and friends.  Thanks lamora beauty for this brush.</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying a foundation brush, and I really love this brush. I haven&#x27;t had any issues.</li>
            <li> pretty good product. does what it says. makeup goes on nice. would recommend as alternative to higher end brushes like sigma f80.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this brush. It is so soft to the skin and really gives you that flawless look to your skin. I use it for both my liquid and powder foundation and barely have to use any for that full coverage look. Recommend this to everyone out there!!!</li>
            <li> I use bareMinerals powder foundation with my Lamora brush and love it.</li>
            <li> great brush, perfect size, great quality.&lt;br /&gt;helps a lot to apply perfect foundation</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive my full purchase. Only one brush arrived &amp; not the one I needed.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with purchase. Exactly as described! Great brush for a great price!</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect  I highly recommend &#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li> I love it! it is just that I need!</li>
            <li> I love the foundation brush do it for me</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister and she absolutely loves it. When I compared it to the sigma f80 flat top kabuki brush this one is just as amazing and cheaper.</li>
            <li> Loved it! So easy to use and soft on my face :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for weeks now. Like it very much ! It&#x27;s think and soft and I&#x27;ve not had bristles falling out. I like the big handle as I have some neuropathy in the hands.  Very glad I purchased.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and great to use for foundation application! It spreads powder and mousse evenly. Keep it clean for best results.</li>
            <li> Love this brush.  I use it for my mineral make up and it holds the minerals quite well.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a great brush at a reasonable price for applying my makeup and I found this brush and I must say it does an awesome job. It het a flawless finish.</li>
            <li> Loving it! The first time I used it (with my normal make up) I got compliments on my face being flawless. This is not a compliment I usually get. I think it&#x27;s great, seller is great, will buy again.</li>
            <li> it  is  a  good quality brush  for  foundation, so  far i like it,  i have  to  test it mort  thou</li>
            <li> My brush broke after 2 weeks of use. I gave 4 stars because for the time I had it performed very well. The customer service is very good. Once I told them about what happened they agreed to send a replacement out.</li>
            <li> I have all the expensive brushes; this ,now, is the only one I use for foundation.</li>
            <li> OMGosh I love this brush! IT IS AWESOME! I bought two anticipating issues or having to clean it all the time but OMGosh, when they advertise that the liquid make up doesn&#x27;t stick to the brush and goes on your face where it belongs, they&#x27;re not kidding! I am using SO MUCH LESS foundation than I used to use with what I was told was the best brush because it was fox fur (natural). This brush is THE BEST BRUSH EVER--buy it, don&#x27;t hesitate, you&#x27;ll love it. I do that trick of dotting my face really fast with it (forget the term) and with so little make up, I get so much coverage and so fast. I tried the airbrush stuff and it was taking forever and it was so wet that I&#x27;d have to wait or blow dry my face to move forward--I hated it. I AM SO HAPPY I BOUGHT THESE BRUSHES!!!</li>
            <li> The bristles are not dense but flimsey, unlike a Kabuki Flat top brush should be.  My sigma brush and beautie junkie brushes are so much better.</li>
            <li> I love it.  Puts my bronzer on smoothly and even.  High quality!</li>
            <li> I would give 1 star, but it was free.  I got this brush when they had a promo code.  When I got the brush I loved it; it was nice and soft and the perfect firmness, and it still is, only the metal is now loose from the wood handle and it feels like it&#x27;s going to fall apart any day.  I have only had it a few months, and though I have cleaned the brush, I have only cleaned the part that touches the makeup and it was never submerged in water to destroy the glue (I made that mistake with an eye makeup brush a few years back).  If the company ran another promotion, I would try another one of their brushes and hope for longer lasting quality.  If this brush would have lasted longer, I would have probably slowly began switching out some of my bareminerals brushes and replacing with brushes from this company.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic flat brush for applying foundation .  This is my first experience using a brush to use after putting liquid foundation and it made a huge difference in the overall appearance of my makeup.  I would recommend a flat brush to anyone and I really endorse this Kabuki brush from Lamora Beauty on Amazon.  I received this brush in two days and I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this brush.  You won&#x27;t be sorry if you purchase this high quality brush!!!</li>
            <li> i had few set of Lamora brushes past few month, and i like them more and more,,,&lt;br /&gt;first i got eye set and it works perfect for my eye , and i had 6 piece set. and it is really beautiful case and quality is great,&lt;br /&gt;i was little hesitate to order  flat top Kabuki, because 6 piece set has almost same size Kabuki... anyway i ordered... and i am so glad i did, this is more dense than other brush, and work really good with my liquid foundation.&lt;br /&gt;i love their quality and it is really nice brush for such a great price,&lt;br /&gt;Thank you  to LAMORA !!</li>
            <li> I just want to start off with I have never done a review. But this brush is amazing. I love it. It puts your makeup on flawless. 5 stars for me. I&#x27;m gonna order another one.</li>
            <li> I received this product at a discounted amount and I would like to leave my unbiased opinion.&lt;br /&gt;~~ I have attached some images of what my order looked like upon arriving at my house. Upon opening the package in the 2nd picture with the plastic cap that was holding the brush head into place, I knew I was getting a great item when I saw that. In the third, fourth and fifth picture I am showing you different angles of the brush. I own plenty of expensive brushes and let me just tell you this Kabuki brush is not a cheaply made, hard or hurting on your face when applied. It is sooo darn soft that I kept touching the brush over my fingers. When I applied my makeup with the brush I was extremely overwhelmed by the coverage it did and the bristles didnt feel like it was in my pores!! Can we say BONUS!! It feels almost like silk,  I have now officially put my other kabuki brushes to sleep, forever!! Its a great investment, I guarantee you YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!! MUST TRY THIS BEFORE ORDERING ANY OTHER BRAND!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful brush made of high quality materials. Application of liquid foundation is smooth and flawless!</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this brush !</li>
            <li> I love the way this brush blends my foundation. My makeup looks flawless.</li>
            <li> Works best for mineral powders, but you can use this for liquid as well, with a good amount of buffing.  Literally no shedding, even when washed! Great dense brush.</li>
            <li> Great quality brush for little cost! Super soft and easy to use:)</li>
            <li> This brush is velvety soft and dense enough to hold and blend product very well.</li>
            <li> Placed my order on August 23rd and it was my foundation brush was delivered on the 25th.  Great Quality! Great for applying foundation evenly without using too much product.</li>
            <li> This brush is a winner and I have high standards. Applying foundation is easier and the finished look is better than ever. Yay.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for my Bare Minerals Bareskin liquid foundation at less then half the price (I bought it on a one-day markdown) of the Bare Minerals brush that is sold for that purpose. The regular price of this brush is still less than the Bare Minerals one.</li>
            <li> Use this everyday! I love it!</li>
            <li> Thank you for the brush and all the additional information about use and cleaning it.  This is the best brush I have ever used.  I plan on replacing all my brushes with your brand.</li>
            <li> The brush is not the quality I expected, I will stick to Sigma for now!</li>
            <li> First foundation brush I have used. It works great. I will not be using sponge applicators again.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing!  I washed it when I got it and there was no fall out, I let it air dry overnight and used it the next day.  The brush delivers the product evenly and smoothly and feels so good on your skin.  This brush helps smooth the product evenly over your face and blends out very well. This is now my go to brush, I highly recommend this brush for your BB cream, foundation, powder, etc.</li>
            <li> Great product.....bristles are softer than other similar brushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This brush doesn&#x27;t shed!  I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised with this brush. It&#x27;s priced well,  it arrived very quickly, and it&#x27;s just the right size for applying and blending my bb cream and foundation.  It comes with instructions for cleaning that are helpful too.&lt;br /&gt;I think I will buy other brushes from this company in the future.</li>
            <li> order got cancelled without any notice</li>
            <li> I liked it. It is soft.</li>
            <li> Wow - my only regret is not buying this brush sooner! I can&#x27;t believe how much smoother and more natural my foundation looks with this brush. I am highly considering all of the other brushes for my kit.</li>
            <li> I recieved this brush for testing purposes. It really passed the test. This flat top kabuki brush is very exquisite in craftsmanship and detail. The barrel has the logo Lamora inscribed on it and the name of the brush and number on the other side. The handle is very sturdy and the brush is super soft to the touch. I washed it and it dried over night which was a plus and it packed on my foundation powder and applied great on my face. I didn&#x27;t want to stop swirling on my face because it felt so good and soft. This u a fabulous product that does not shed or loose it&#x27;s shape. I definately recommend this Lamora Kabuki brush! I also like that this brush works well with cream and liquid products as well so another plus for Lamora.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I use liquid foundation, and primer and it applies make up flawlessly. And a little goes a long way when using this brush also. I do think the price was a little expensive for one brush. But a good buy.</li>
            <li> This brush is one of the best that I own. The bristles are so soft so it feels great on your skin and distributes the makeup evenly. I would definitely purchase another brush from Lamora.</li>
            <li> Nice brush for the price! My friend has the Sigma F80 and this is pretty similar! Not *as* dense as the F80 but it has really nice coverage. The brush came really quickly too! Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for a couple of months and it&#x27;s still great.  It applies makeup nicely and does not shed.  It&#x27;s really nice not having to worry about hair from my makeup brush all over my face.</li>
            <li> This brush set is great! OK, yes, I received a free flat top kabuki from Lamora, but I really do like it! I use it almost exclusively to apply my foundation. It&#x27;s very soft and applies foundation smoothly. I wash my brushes weekly and have not experienced any fallout of bristles. Now if only Lamora would sell their brushes individually... ;-)</li>
            <li> I really like this brush for applying my foundations. It gives a nice air brushed effect when I stipple and then use in a circular motion. Now, just let me say I was kinda hesitant to use this brush because my absolute favorite foundation brush is my Morphe 439. That is my go to,reach for it every time brush for all of my foundations. This Lamora brush is a very close second. I don&#x27;t even use my Real Technique and  Estee Lauder brushes anymore. I&#x27;ve had it for a over a month now and have washed it numerous times and none of the bristles have come out and and it still retained it&#x27;s shape, so for the price the quality is really good.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because it&#x27;s just not as dense as the Moprhe brush, but it is still a great brush.</li>
            <li> Better than most brushes and really comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li> Delivery came very fast. I used amazon prime trial. Used the brush a couple times and like it a lot so far. I also cleaned it before using it no shedding occurred. Not bad at all for price.</li>
            <li> ðŸ’¦WashingðŸ’¦&lt;br /&gt;The brush smelled a little when I received it but I did receive an email stating to wash the brush before use. No weird bleeding dyes or bristles falling out during the washing process and the smell went away completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pressed Powder Foundation&lt;br /&gt;I decided to compare this brush to my Sigma F80. I did notice that my Sigma brush is just slightly more dense and to make sure that I gave it a true comparison, I did half my face with Sigma and the other half With Lamora. They preformed EXACTLY the same!!! I&#x27;m very impressed with Lamora&#x27;s Flat top kabuki, especially since I washed it again for use tomorrow and still not shedding!&lt;br /&gt;BB Cream&lt;br /&gt;Even though the Lamora brush isn&#x27;t as dense as the Sigma F80, I still received the exact same results! The Flat Kabuki blended my BB Cream beautifully, and none of the product got sucked into the brush making it super easy and fast the clean. Every day that I test something new with this brush, I become more impressed then the day before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blush&lt;br /&gt;I used the flat top for both powder and cream blush and it applied both flawlessly!!! I am 100% impressed by this brush that I bought the whole set of brushes!!!! I can&#x27;t wait to be impressed by them All!!</li>
            <li> I love the way it blends my foundation or bb cream when I don&#x27;t want to use my hands. :) The brush feels nice too.</li>
            <li> One of the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever bought and I tried them all. Mac is good too</li>
            <li> Love this brush! Just as good as the Sigma flat top kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> Received this brush as part of a promotion, and it was worth way more than what I paid for it! I absolutely love this brush and it&#x27;s so soft and distributes my foundation so well and evenly.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! So soft, great smooth flawless application.  Better than sponges, fingers, or flat brushes for application.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! So soft &amp; easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. The application is gentle and extremely soft. I will definitely be purchasing more brushes by this brand. Can&#x27;t beat the quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Ordered as gift for significant other. Functional, suits its intended purpose! Girlfriend is very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> THIS BRUSH!!! Amazing quality for such a low price... I&#x27;m so glad I ended up buying this item and probably going to purchase another for a friend. Excellent communication.. Obsessed!!!</li>
            <li> Great product, loved the kabuki brush and how it applied my foundation so smoothly. Shipped on time as promised.</li>
            <li> In all honestly I thought that it was just going to be just another &amp;#34;Amazon&amp;#34; make up brush that was going to be cheap &amp; be harsh on my skin when used, but I was VERY surprised upon receiving it how SOFT yet STURDY the brush was. When pressed on the skin it didn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;pokey&amp;#34; nor irritating. Defiantly applied my foundation in a very smooth, brought out the best out of my foundation. Hopefully there&#x27;s more sales for their other brushes soon. I will for sure be buying more!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush. So soft and the perfect size for applying my foundation which goes on smooth and flawless. Really the best thing short of airbrushing!</li>
            <li> Great brush! Make great application with liquid foundation! Great quality with this price!</li>
            <li> Very nice brush! Finally used it and I like it a lot. It&#x27;s very soft and none of the bristles came out after washing. Also quick delivery. &amp;#60;--]</li>
            <li> Great Brush! Feels awesome on my skin and applies makeup beautifully.</li>
            <li> Fast service! Love this brush!</li>
            <li> I started wearing liquid foundation resently.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot on a brush and say this offer.  I love this brush.  Blends and covers well without sucking up all my makeup.</li>
            <li> Beautiful brush! No problems with bristle loss, caresses your face. I have used it for both powder and liquid base. Works perfect. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful brush exactly as described.  I love the velvety softness and density of this synthetic brush!  As soon as the larger set gets back in stock, I will be buying more of these.  I have no idea about the longevity as of yet, but I will update my review in a year or two to report back on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please Note:  I did purchase the entire 10 brush set on September 30, 2014, but for some reason, I can&#x27;t leave a review on it because I bought this one brush first, and it didn&#x27;t allow me to leave THAT review.  I will contact Amazon via chat and see if they can fix that for me, but until then, I wanted to give my 5 star review on the entire set of 10, with the included travel/home container. I am glad I purchased these as they are all top quality, incredibly soft, a good density and feel wonderful on my face.  I really like that they are marked on each brush what each one is for as I can easily look up what they were designed to do by reading their (PDF download)after my purchase which provides more detailed information on each brush.  I only wish that I hadn&#x27;t been so eager to purchase these when they came back in stock that I forgot to use my 10% off coupon that they had so graciously sent to me earlier! The case is designed with a snap closure to keep the dry brushes protected, and is very attractive and sturdy.  This is the first set of brushes I&#x27;ve ever owned, and I&#x27;m delighted to have them!</li>
            <li> Love this brush!!! Better than any others I have tried over the years.</li>
            <li> Given the dual tone of the bristles, I thought this brush would be duo fibre, but the bristles are just dyed white at the top. I find that the &amp;#34;real techniques&amp;#34; flat top stippling brush is much better (also cheaper), since the duo fibres help release more of the make up onto your skin without being held and trapped in the brush. I also found that since the bristles were too densely packed, it took longer for me to buff and blend liquid foundation since the brush felt very stiff (hope that makes sense). I would say that this would be best used to buff in concealer- for an all over face brush, I would definitely recommend a duo fibre or larger kabuki.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mostly, I am very frustrated that this company would send SO many emails after my purchase. I did not ever sign up to be on an email list, so I feel that this was unnecessary. They should have asked whether I wanted to be signed up for emails...and not all of their emails even include an &amp;#34;unsubscribe&amp;#34; link, so I was confused as to how I would even stop receiving them! Keep in mind that other brushes are just as good if not better but might not have as many ratings because the company does not incessantly pester their customers to leave a review.</li>
            <li> I received this a few weeks ago and it is a great foundation brush! Nice and soft. With daily use, and weekly washing, it has held together and kept it&#x27;s shape and I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding or lose parts. Makes my foundation appear flawless.</li>
            <li> Softest brush I have ever bought. Applied foundation so smoothly.</li>
            <li> This is THE BEST foundation brush I&#x27;ve ever found!  It&#x27;s so soft and actually saves you money by using just the bare minimum of your mineral powders and covers flawlessly!  Great purchase!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve have purchased from this company before and had a bad experience with the 8 brush set (I will say their customer service was amazing), but this particular brush is actually pretty well made! In comparison to the Sigma F80, it is definitely not as dense although it does the job just as well. I mainly use it for a more sheer coverage and ALWAYS press it into the skin with the foundation. Overall it is extremely soft and the bristles have not shed thus far despite having it for a few months. My only concern is that I&#x27;ve had my Sigma F80 for MUCH longer, and the handle on this one is already loose despite the fact that I wash them the same way. I use this especially for younger clients(highschool prom photos, young bridesmaids.) Or for mature clients who prefer a more sheer and matte coverage. I did receive this when they sent customers a free coupon code for this product which I really appreciate. But for the price point normally I would repurchase either way.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this brush!!</li>
            <li> I love this brush!! I use it for almost everything for blending concealer into my foundation and works well with contouring powder and liquid works well with this brush. It is very soft and cleaning it 1 x every week, at least every two weeks really keeps the brush fresh and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Not only do I love my brush I love the Customer Service Lamora Beauty has. They kept me posted during every step of the ordering/shipping process and they even sent me some beauty tips. I loved the brush so much I went and purchased their brush set!!! Can&#x27;t wait to see more items they begin to offer.</li>
            <li> Its so soft and applies foundation so well. Love it!</li>
            <li> Awesome brush, and the same quality as the other one I have that was more expensive.  I&#x27;m thinking of buying another one to have on hand.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! It is incredibly soft and works wonders. Best brush I have ever gotten the chance to use. Completely smooth application. I am so glad I was able to get my hands on it.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing!  It uses very little liquid foundation to get the job done.  You can stipple it on and then brush in circles to blend it out for the beautiful airbrushed look.  I am very happy with this purchase and plan on purchasing Lamora&#x27;s tapered end brush in the same line for more precision application around the eyes and nose.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> Love this brush, soft bristles that don&#x27;t fall out</li>
            <li> I use this brush all the time for my foundation. I use powder foundation and this really grabs a good amount of the product and lets me buff it on with no issues. It&#x27;s one of the softest brushes, I will definitely be buying a replacement when I need it.</li>
            <li> I saw the ad for this brush on Facebook and was drawn in by the fact that it would be free for the first 50 or so people to click on it. I didn&#x27;t think it would actually be free but it was, and it arrived in two days because of Amazon Prime. The quality of this brush is great. It&#x27;s very soft, although it isn&#x27;t as dense as it looks. I use it to blend in my liquid foundation and it provides good coverage and a good finish! There&#x27;s very minimal shedding, but I don&#x27;t mind. I would really love to try more brushes from Lamora after this one.</li>
            <li> I Love this kabuki brush. I have been using it a few weeks now. The bristles are thick and soft. Also apply product to the face nicely. Will be ordering two more. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more.  They are sooooo soft,</li>
            <li> Absolutely anyone can use this brush to create a flawless look - extremely easy to use and the outcome is perfection. This one&#x27;s a MUST!</li>
            <li> Its really soft. You use WAY less liquid foundation with this brush. Highly recommended and worth the money.i will purchase other products.</li>
            <li> This brush is dense, soft, and hasn&#x27;t shed a bristle. For the price point it&#x27;s astounding.</li>
            <li> Love my new foundation brush, it works just like I am using it to paint a canvas. Great quality!</li>
            <li> I just love this Flat Top Kabuki Brush! It&#x27;s very soft and applies foundation flawlessly. I actually prefer to use this over the new Sigma 3dhd Kabuki brush. Excellent quality for the price and the best part no shedding.</li>
            <li> The brush arrived fairly quickly, and the package was in good condition. I have been using the brush for about four weeks now and I really like it. It leaves a really nice matte finish, or a dewy finish depending on your foundation. The brush is very full and the bristles are very soft. They don&#x27;t fall out easily which is a huge plus for a foundation brush.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price.  Nice bristles, wash out well without having a shedding issue. I will purchase more of this product line as I need to replace my stock.  Thanks, Lamora</li>
            <li> Good brush.  Great price point.  I&#x27;d recommend it!</li>
            <li> I am more interested in quality than quantity, so the items that I use that are subjected to &amp;#34;daily wear and tear&amp;#34; must &amp;#34;stand the test of time&amp;#34;.  I am not a make-up artist, but I like durable, soft, dense, and shed-free brushes.  I own Sigma, Sephora, mac, mineral fusion and other more expensive brushes, but I must say that I am very pleased with my Lamora brushes.  They are comparable and significantly less expensive than the other brushes that I own and if you are about quality, I would recommend Lamora.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;March 30, 2015:  Now that I have I&#x27;ve been using these brushes for a couple of months, I feel that I can give a more honest and accurate review regarding there quality and durability.  I own Sigma foundation kabuki brushes and although Lamora brushes look similar, they are not as dense as my Sigma brushes.  I appreciate the price of Lamora brushes, but I prefer a more dense (Sigma) brush.</li>
            <li> I love how natural this brush makes my foundation looks! Definitely considering purchasing all of my makeup brushes from this brand.</li>
            <li> I received this brush free as a promotion and have been using it for over a month. Eh, it&#x27;s okay. I am used to using a foundation brush for the airbrushed effect and use a foundation meant to be applied with a brush. The brush was hard and does not apply as well as my MAC brush did. I will stick with my other favorite one. Probably fine for the $10 price point as I paid twice that for MAC brush, so it garners three stars.</li>
