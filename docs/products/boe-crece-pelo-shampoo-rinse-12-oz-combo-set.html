            <li>CRECE PELO SHAMPOO AND RINSE IS A FANTASTIC DUO.</li>
            <li>, it smells really nice and the scent lasts for a couple of days; I&#x27;d say about 3-5 days, so basically until you&#x27;re ready to wash your hair again.</li>
            <li>It smells good and makes your hair so soft.  </li>

            <li>ITS THE SAME PRICE AS THE SUPERMARKET BRANDS, BUT DOES SO MUCH MORE FOR YOUR HAIR.</li>
            <li>This is the first shampoo and conditioner that has made a real difference in my daughters hair.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair grow and it also makes the hair super soft and silk.</li>
            <li>already see new hair growth!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reasonably priced, it works.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>And wow, what shine and manageability!!!</li>
            <li>Also it has a nice small that leaves in your hair.</li>
            <li>as it adds loads of moisture and Kanechcom can make the hair feel like paper (but that makes for super fast flat ironing).</li>
            <li>Our hair really does not &amp;#34;hang&amp;#34;, it just poofs out, and it&#x27;s very cottony &amp; soft.</li>
            <li>IT WORKS LIKE AN HIGH END PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s one of my staple products that I have so far.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not bad at all, and I am extremely sensitive to those fake chemical smells that is found in most of our American hair products.</li>
            <li>Her hair was very fine and grew very slowly.</li>
            <li>I have a THICK head of natural Afro hair and this gets it all clean.</li>
            <li>this product does have a distinct fragrance that seems like a green plant?</li>

            <li> Many people with Thyroid issues often have dry brittle hair, please try this before trying those expensive prescription shampoos.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I heard about this product on You tube and decided to try it.. I  love it. It smells good and makes your hair so soft.  I will definitely be trying their other products as well</li>
            <li> CRECE PELO SHAMPOO AND RINSE IS A FANTASTIC DUO. THE SHAMPOO GETS THE HAIR REALLY CLEAN WITH OUT DRYING IT OUT. MY HAIR BECAME SOFT AFTER I RINSED THE SHAMPOO OUT. THE RINSE IS SO GOOD, IT CAN BE USED AS A DEEP CONDITIONER. ITS EXCELLENT FOR DETANGLING COMB-THROUGH. THE RINSE LEAVES THE HAIR SO VERY SOFT AND MANAGEABLE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS A DOMINICAN PRODUCT I WISH EVERYONE COULD KNOW ABOUT.  ITS GREAT FOR DRY, DAMAGED HAIR. ALL TYPES OF HAIR CAN BENEFIT FROM THIS PRODUCT. ITS THE SAME PRICE AS THE SUPERMARKET BRANDS, BUT DOES SO MUCH MORE FOR YOUR HAIR. IT WORKS LIKE AN HIGH END PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been living with this product since I was born, I LOVE IT! all I have to say. I highly recommend</li>
            <li> Love this Dominican Hair Product! Leaves my hair nice and shiny.</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair smell after I use this shampoo</li>
            <li> Yep! This deserves 5 Stars. I have that&amp;#34; Fluffy Fro&amp;#34; 4B hair just like Prince &amp; only those with this type know the troubles we have. Shrinks up 50-75% if there is ANY moisture in the air.  Our hair really does not &amp;#34;hang&amp;#34;, it just poofs out, and it&#x27;s very cottony &amp; soft. Our hair often looks dry too. Well, this Dominican product is awesome, and it&#x27;s true, the Rinse product really works magic! I can&#x27;t explain it...this product does have a distinct fragrance that seems like a green plant? Maybe something that grows in the Dominican? But it&#x27;s not bad at all, and I am extremely sensitive to those fake chemical smells that is found in most of our American hair products. Anyway, buy this. It&#x27;s reasonably priced, it works. This is the secret conditioner they use in the Dominican Salons when flat ironing, my hair did not revert! and it&#x27;s very hard to keep that from happening. I have raved before about Kanechecom &amp; Silicon Mix, but this is even better than that! as it adds loads of moisture and Kanechcom can make the hair feel like paper (but that makes for super fast flat ironing). Many people with Thyroid issues often have dry brittle hair, please try this before trying those expensive prescription shampoos. I also had a dry brittle crown as I age, and this seemed to take care of it.&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up if you like my review. I really enjoy giving my honest opinion about things. Add this product line to your hair regime, you won&#x27;t need anything else!</li>
            <li> It works, keeps your hair from falling out.  It will take a few weeks but you will notice a difference.</li>
            <li> Product as described , shipping as described, it was very fast and perfect condition, will buy again</li>
            <li> I have a THICK head of natural Afro hair and this gets it all clean. I have been using this for about a month and I have seen some growth. The shampoo was a little stripping to my hair so I do a pre-poo with so olive oil BEFORE using. That helps for sure. I do have the treatment and leave-in. Which I use all together. It also came with a hair clip. Not sure if I will use it but I appreciate it</li>
            <li> Love this product it really worked&lt;br /&gt;For me.. Also it has a nice small that leaves in your hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo and rinse about a month ago. My hair hasn&#x27;t been this healthy in years!&lt;br /&gt;Due to a thyroid condition my hair had begun to fall out. After getting my health back through medication&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to restore my hair to the way it was. This product has given me a good start.&lt;br /&gt;I already see new hair growth!! And wow, what shine and manageability!!! Works better than some&lt;br /&gt;more expensive products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo &amp; Rinse I use,my hair really grew out nice!</li>
            <li> Great product. It makes your hair grow and it also makes the hair super soft and silk. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Crece Pelo is spanish for &amp;#34;GROWS HAIR&amp;#34;. It doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This product worked well with my hair. You must use the shampoo and follow with the conditioner because they are suppose to work together. The shampoo felt like a clarifying shampoo but the conditioner replaced and added moisture and softness to my hair. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using them separately with another product. They may not have the same effect. I&#x27;m interested in their  conditioning  treatment because I was impressed with this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it smells really nice and the scent lasts for a couple of days; I&#x27;d say about 3-5 days, so basically until you&#x27;re ready to wash your hair again. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product if you have locks because it will soften your hair and cause slippage of your locks or unraveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side Note: The item wasn&#x27;t shipped as quickly as they stated but  I didn&#x27;t receive it too late either. Bottom line if you promise on Amazon a specific arrival time I expect to receive it at that time.</li>
            <li> Definitley recommend this brand. It&#x27;s one of my staple products that I have so far. Check out my YouTube review on Just Ebby</li>
            <li> This is the first shampoo and conditioner that has made a real difference in my daughters hair. Her hair was very fine and grew very slowly. After using this product for about eight months, there has been a significant change to her hair. It is stronger, fuller and growing! I now buy it for my three daughters and have recommended it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Simply Amazing Shampoo. This is the real deal. Highly recommend you try it. My wife swares by it. Helped her grow her hair longer faster and the scent is great.</li>
            <li> Awsome!! My hair is super healthy and clean</li>
