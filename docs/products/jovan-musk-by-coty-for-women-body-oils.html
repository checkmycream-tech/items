            <li>I always recieve so many compliments.  </li>
            <li>I found that if you pair Jovan Musk Oil with Coty Musk Spray it blends better than using the Jovan Musk Spray.</li>
            <li>Have used this for many years during the winter as I think it smells more like winter than summer.  </li>
            <li>And yes most men love it.</li>
            <li>I have to say that my mom and I love this perfume oil.  </li>

            <li>I used many years ago.&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find it any more.</li>
            <li>Will have to order more.</li>
            <li>The oil is much better and lasts longer than the spray.</li>
            <li>I was glad I found it on Amazon and saved myself some money.</li>
            <li>This is my mom&#x27;s favorite</li>
            <li>Nice light smell</li>
            <li>This is my favorite musk oil.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve yet to find a better alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>it can&#x27;t even be enjoyed by the person wearing it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of musk oil.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Jovan Musk Oil for many years and still love it.  </li>
            <li>I love Jovan Musk Oil</li>
            <li>Love the product and the price, you won&#x27;t find it any cheaper anywhere.</li>
            <li>love the oil</li>
            <li>I love the smell together</li>
            <li>I get more use from the oil than the spray.</li>
            <li>My all time favorite</li>
            <li>I know most of us wore this in the 70&#x27;s</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love this product and have used it for years.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love this scent.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite scents</li>
            <li>This has been a favorite of mines for years.  </li>
            <li>I love the oil, its heavenly</li>
            <li>I love musk</li>
            <li>the scent is perfect and I can&#x27;t get enough of it.  </li>
            <li>It was infinitely better than this krap.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume and I can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love Jovan.</li>
            <li>Wish she wore it more often.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my mother, as she told me she used to love Jovan Musk years ago.  </li>
            <li>It does not have a strong smell very light</li>
            <li>Yes, it has been that long, and I have tried others, but Jovan Musk Oil is the best perfume I have ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and mild.  </li>
            <li>they no longer make the original Skin oil perfume I have switched to Jovan Musk and it&#x27;s as close to the scent I&#x27;ve worn since being a teenager many many years ago...</li>
            <li>The scent is light, refreshing, &amp; it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>It was the most significant impulse buy I have ever made.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean, spicy and exotic.</li>
            <li>easy...</li>
            <li>I have a sensitivity to aromas and can wear this without smelling it to strongly.</li>
            <li>It is my work fragrance because it is not too strong and over bearing.  </li>
            <li>Classic sent always good</li>
            <li>This is not &amp;#34;musky&amp;#34; like patchouli but more of a sweet smell but not flowery.</li>
            <li>for me, the smell makes me sensual, soft and pleasant  </li>
            <li>Of all the ones that had were pleasant, it seems rather sadistic that this is the one still on the market, while others are asking that Coty Wild Musk and others be brought</li>
            <li>Such a great scent.  </li>
            <li>I wear it strictly for myself, it brings back happy memories of the 70s..</li>
            <li>I happily give the oil, the cologne and the body lotion five stars, wishing I could give them each ten!  </li>
            <li>When I found out it wasn&#x27;t available, I purchased this instead.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is Fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Jovan has kept the same formula, and not messed around with fads, giving me a mellow smellow that keeps on making me happy.</li>
            <li>I have used it for many years with no disappointment.</li>
            <li>this has a light smell that doesnt stay.</li>
            <li>, it is just fabulous still</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best one in my opinion, reminds me of my teenage years.</li>
            <li>Like alwas Amazon stood  be hind it and made sure everything was right</li>
            <li>It has a very clean smell and constantly people tell me how good I smell.</li>
            <li>Has a very distinct scent that I will recommend to others.</li>
            <li>None the less, it&#x27;s a great perfume/oil and love it.</li>
            <li>I still get compliments when I wear it, but I wish they would return to the original formula.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get this &amp;#34;Jovan Musk&amp;#34; in the package.  </li>
            <li>but It&#x27;s just not the original scent I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I did purchase the \\&quot;sold by Amazon\\&quot; product, and I received the original Jovan box as pictured.</li>
            <li>well it not, for I know what original musk oil is.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to give this to her, and she was so excited to receive it -- until she tried it on.  </li>
            <li>No perfume smell, just a clean smell</li>
            <li>I guess I would say it&#x27;s a clean fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love this musk oil because it&#x27;s not overpowering, but yet nice enough that I always get compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li>It even leaks when it falls over in my make-up box, which isn&#x27;t great, because it&#x27;s not really designed to stand up.</li>
            <li>I have always loved Jovan&#x27;s &#x27;White Musk&#x27; spray cologne as well as the body lotion.  </li>
            <li>I recalled that I always loved the scent of Jovan musk oil back in the seventies</li>
            <li>but it is a nice soft fragerance .  </li>
            <li>Believe me when I tell you it is true..</li>
            <li>Nice soft scent and has a stick to apply with and it</li>
            <li>I still love it, &amp; it&#x27;s much cheaper on Amazon than anywhere else.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a BAD scent, but it&#x27;s not what she remembered or wanted.  </li>
            <li>THE PRICE WAS RIGHT AND FIT INTO MY BUDGET.  </li>
            <li>The scent smells great without being overpowering like other scents.  </li>
            <li>But it quickly faded, because this &#x27;Musk Oil&#x27; has NO scent whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>Grandma Shirley loves this perfume and the oil really lasts a long time and she smells great in this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still pretty good in my opinion, but believe me, the formula has definitely changed.</li>
            <li>With the item I recieved bunch of samples!&lt;br /&gt;The oil smells awesome and last a long time!&lt;br /&gt;Great to get it as a gift.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I wanted and had no luck finding it here!</li>
            <li>The purchase was well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Still fresh smelling and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>If anyone has found a better alternative to Body Shop&#x27;s original White Musk, please respond to this message!</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t like musk, but this has a very light scent and is kind of airy.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s on the right track...</li>
            <li>I have used this perfume since the mid 1970&#x27;s, and it remains my true favorite .</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a very strong smell like back in the day!</li>
            <li>Wow, I opened this bottle and the smell took me straight back to the 70s when this was very popular.</li>
            <li>The amazing thing about this entire deal was the fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It smells the same and brings back a lot of great memories.    </li>
            <li>Soft, NEVER too strong, sensual &amp; attracting.</li>
            <li>I got it very fast.</li>
            <li>I bought 3 packages to give them as gifts and gave the first one to my wife.</li>
            <li>This is the only scent I have ever been able to wear (everything else gives me a headache), and I gave up wearing anything when I didn&#x27;t see it in stores anymore.  </li>
            <li>We got it and it smelled exactly as I remembered, and it was oil and the scent lingered all day.</li>
            <li>Outstanding fragrance  especially when paired with patchouilly oil......</li>
            <li>and I love wearing it daily to work!  </li>
            <li>This perfume is exactly like the musk oil from years ago.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve come up against this with Amazon</li>
            <li>So don&#x27; waste your money and more importantly your prestige by buying this item.</li>
            <li>And the price is sooooo much more reasonable here @ $9 a bottle ... that same bottle goes for $16 in the stores.  </li>
            <li>This order came fast and the perfume was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I use this in conjunction with the concentrated cologne, and it will last 18-24 hours, easy.  </li>
            <li>It must be super old.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a classic and will never go out of style!  </li>
            <li>Not so long ago this oil was strong enough to be enjoyed all day long, but now it is so light</li>
            <li>The origina Musk perfume that has a gentle though peasant fragrance that does not overwhelm.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>Yes - this is the real thing.  </li>
            <li>I have to repurchase another one again really soon.</li>
            <li>I really wanted her to use it.</li>
            <li>you have applied to much, and a scent should be a whisper, so don&#x27;t shout it out.  </li>
            <li>This was a gift for a very dear friend.</li>
            <li>it, looks of people ask me where it came from and how much i paid for it.</li>
            <li>Absolutely a fragrance that you can wear every day and not feel overpowered by the musk smell.  </li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>Goes very well with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn this perfume since I was in high school, &amp; I&#x27;m 58 now!  </li>
            <li>The only reason I gave this perfume 4 stars, instead of 5, is because I prefer the original, &#x27;roll-on&#x27; applicator&lt;br /&gt;to</li>
            <li>Seems to be very similar to the original product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this on and off for many years and will not wear any other perfume/oil.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other fragrances over the years, but always choose Musk as my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Favorite perfume, hands down.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s timeless and classic and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Classic.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to find the Jovan Mush Oil that I remembered from long ago....</li>
            <li>I used to wear this when I was in high school.  </li>
            <li>Highly recomend.</li>
            <li>It is a subtle, clean fragrance and does not aggravate even the most sensitive noses.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d go broke wearing this oil every day because it does require a lot more than just a little dab a day.</li>
            <li>Too bad because it used to be the best.</li>
            <li>, how can you go wrong, great price.</li>
            <li>It put a big smile on her face.</li>
            <li>Seems to be a good price since she only uses a small amount.</li>
            <li>Does not have the same fresh scent seems ..as if water was added to the Musk?</li>
            <li>This musk oil has been a favorite for a very long time and when I could not find the oil locally</li>
            <li>Very mild and not strong, I get quiet a few compliments as to how good I smell.</li>
            <li>I could not really remember how this smelled until opening it, then it was so familiar.</li>
            <li>Could it have a new recipe?</li>
            <li>My wife was looking for a new perfume for herself.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;ll need a new bottle around Christmas.</li>
            <li>Instead of using my Mom&#x27;s bottle, I decided to purchase a new bottle and keep hers as a remembrance of her.  </li>
            <li>The first purchase was beyond my expectations but this purchase was total waist of money.</li>
            <li>They are probably not aware of the original process that was used...</li>
            <li>But to me it&#x27;s the same scent as it was when I first started buying it.  </li>
            <li>But this new bottle smells NOTHING like the old stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She uses quite a few of the older perfumes like Shallimar and White Diamonds, but this Jovan Musk Oil is her favorite.</li>
            <li>Many reviewers have written that the scent is different, or doesn&#x27;t last as long.  </li>
            <li>She always has a hard time finding it in stores, so I&#x27;m glad to have found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>using it for years a soft scent that is not over powering</li>
            <li>This Musk oil last throughout  the whole day. .</li>
            <li>This is really the only musk oil I&#x27;ve ever smelled so can&#x27;t compare Musk scents.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t smell like I remembered it, maybe because it&#x27;s so old .</li>
            <li>but now it is much lighter than in recent years.</li>
            <li>This is one of my old favs that I plan on continuing to order in the years to come.</li>
            <li>I have used this musk for decades and was surprised by the change.</li>
            <li>I found an old bottle of Jovan Musk Oil in among my mom&#x27;s things after she passed away.  </li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m surprised by this also because of the way it was packaged and shipped since it&#x27;s deemed \\&quot;HAZARDOUS\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>love this scent, and it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find!</li>
            <li>Another classic gone forever, such a shame!</li>
            <li>Very good price - less expensive that some others.</li>
            <li>This is an unusual scent that lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>They can be divided into three major classes: aromatic nitro musk, polycyclic musk compounds, and macrocyclic musk.  </li>
            <li>Bring back the old scent!  </li>
            <li>, it is still there, only more subtle.  </li>
            <li>Since obtaining the deer musk requires killing the endangered animal, nearly all musk fragrance used in perfumery today is synthetic, sometimes called \\&quot;white musk\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also received bottles with barely any fragrance to it, just oil.</li>
            <li>I do hope they bring the old back.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this perfume and there&#x27;s barely a scent</li>
            <li>last , glad I found on Amazon because it&#x27;s hard to find anymore !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep buying it because I never get tired of the original musk!</li>

            <li> It is not over bearing &amp; makes for a nice scent.</li>

            <li> Love this perfume.</li>

            <li> Satisfied buyer.</li>

            <li> And I love the size,&lt;br /&gt;perfect to keep in your purse.  </li>
            <li> I always recieve so many compliments.  </li>
            <li> I found that if you pair Jovan Musk Oil with Coty Musk Spray it blends better than using the Jovan Musk Spray.</li>
            <li> Have used this for many years during the winter as I think it smells more like winter than summer.  </li>
            <li> And yes most men love it.</li>
            <li> I have to say that my mom and I love this perfume oil.  </li>
            <li> We love it.  </li>
            <li> I used many years ago.&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find it any more.</li>
            <li> Will have to order more.</li>
            <li> The oil is much better and lasts longer than the spray.</li>
            <li> I was glad I found it on Amazon and saved myself some money.</li>
            <li> This is my mom&#x27;s favorite</li>
            <li> Nice light smell</li>
            <li> This is my favorite musk oil.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve yet to find a better alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Jovan Musk Oil by Jovan For Women.  </li>

            <li> Love.</li>
            <li> Love.</li>
            <li> Love.</li>
            <li> it can&#x27;t even be enjoyed by the person wearing it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of musk oil.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Jovan Musk Oil for many years and still love it.  </li>
            <li> I love Jovan Musk Oil</li>
            <li> Love the product and the price, you won&#x27;t find it any cheaper anywhere.</li>
            <li> love the oil</li>
            <li> I love the smell together</li>
            <li> I get more use from the oil than the spray.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite</li>
            <li> I know most of us wore this in the 70&#x27;s</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it for years.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love this scent.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite scents</li>
            <li> This has been a favorite of mines for years.  </li>
            <li> I love the oil, its heavenly</li>
            <li> I love musk</li>
            <li> the scent is perfect and I can&#x27;t get enough of it.  </li>
            <li> It was infinitely better than this krap.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume and I can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love Jovan.</li>
            <li> Wish she wore it more often.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother, as she told me she used to love Jovan Musk years ago.  </li>
            <li> It does not have a strong smell very light</li>
            <li> Yes, it has been that long, and I have tried others, but Jovan Musk Oil is the best perfume I have ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and mild.  </li>
            <li> they no longer make the original Skin oil perfume I have switched to Jovan Musk and it&#x27;s as close to the scent I&#x27;ve worn since being a teenager many many years ago...</li>
            <li> The scent is light, refreshing, &amp; it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> It was the most significant impulse buy I have ever made.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clean, spicy and exotic.</li>
            <li> easy...</li>
            <li> I have a sensitivity to aromas and can wear this without smelling it to strongly.</li>
            <li> It is my work fragrance because it is not too strong and over bearing.  </li>
            <li> Classic sent always good</li>
            <li> This is not &amp;#34;musky&amp;#34; like patchouli but more of a sweet smell but not flowery.</li>
            <li> for me, the smell makes me sensual, soft and pleasant  </li>
            <li> Of all the ones that had were pleasant, it seems rather sadistic that this is the one still on the market, while others are asking that Coty Wild Musk and others be brought</li>
            <li> Such a great scent.  </li>
            <li> I wear it strictly for myself, it brings back happy memories of the 70s..</li>
            <li> I happily give the oil, the cologne and the body lotion five stars, wishing I could give them each ten!  </li>
            <li> When I found out it wasn&#x27;t available, I purchased this instead.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is Fabulous.  </li>
            <li> Jovan has kept the same formula, and not messed around with fads, giving me a mellow smellow that keeps on making me happy.</li>
            <li> I have used it for many years with no disappointment.</li>
            <li> this has a light smell that doesnt stay.</li>
            <li> , it is just fabulous still</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best one in my opinion, reminds me of my teenage years.</li>
            <li> Like alwas Amazon stood  be hind it and made sure everything was right</li>
            <li> It has a very clean smell and constantly people tell me how good I smell.</li>
            <li> Has a very distinct scent that I will recommend to others.</li>
            <li> None the less, it&#x27;s a great perfume/oil and love it.</li>
            <li> I still get compliments when I wear it, but I wish they would return to the original formula.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this &amp;#34;Jovan Musk&amp;#34; in the package.  </li>
            <li> but It&#x27;s just not the original scent I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> I did purchase the \\&quot;sold by Amazon\\&quot; product, and I received the original Jovan box as pictured.</li>
            <li> well it not, for I know what original musk oil is.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to give this to her, and she was so excited to receive it -- until she tried it on.  </li>
            <li> No perfume smell, just a clean smell</li>
            <li> I guess I would say it&#x27;s a clean fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love this musk oil because it&#x27;s not overpowering, but yet nice enough that I always get compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> It even leaks when it falls over in my make-up box, which isn&#x27;t great, because it&#x27;s not really designed to stand up.</li>
            <li> I have always loved Jovan&#x27;s &#x27;White Musk&#x27; spray cologne as well as the body lotion.  </li>
            <li> I recalled that I always loved the scent of Jovan musk oil back in the seventies</li>
            <li> but it is a nice soft fragerance .  </li>
            <li> Believe me when I tell you it is true..</li>
            <li> Nice soft scent and has a stick to apply with and it</li>
            <li> I still love it, &amp; it&#x27;s much cheaper on Amazon than anywhere else.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a BAD scent, but it&#x27;s not what she remembered or wanted.  </li>
            <li> THE PRICE WAS RIGHT AND FIT INTO MY BUDGET.  </li>
            <li> The scent smells great without being overpowering like other scents.  </li>
            <li> But it quickly faded, because this &#x27;Musk Oil&#x27; has NO scent whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> Grandma Shirley loves this perfume and the oil really lasts a long time and she smells great in this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still pretty good in my opinion, but believe me, the formula has definitely changed.</li>
            <li> With the item I recieved bunch of samples!&lt;br /&gt;The oil smells awesome and last a long time!&lt;br /&gt;Great to get it as a gift.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I wanted and had no luck finding it here!</li>
            <li> The purchase was well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Still fresh smelling and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> If anyone has found a better alternative to Body Shop&#x27;s original White Musk, please respond to this message!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like musk, but this has a very light scent and is kind of airy.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s on the right track...</li>
            <li> I have used this perfume since the mid 1970&#x27;s, and it remains my true favorite .</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a very strong smell like back in the day!</li>
            <li> Wow, I opened this bottle and the smell took me straight back to the 70s when this was very popular.</li>
            <li> The amazing thing about this entire deal was the fast delivery.</li>
            <li> It smells the same and brings back a lot of great memories.    </li>
            <li> Soft, NEVER too strong, sensual &amp; attracting.</li>
            <li> I got it very fast.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 packages to give them as gifts and gave the first one to my wife.</li>
            <li> This is the only scent I have ever been able to wear (everything else gives me a headache), and I gave up wearing anything when I didn&#x27;t see it in stores anymore.  </li>
            <li> We got it and it smelled exactly as I remembered, and it was oil and the scent lingered all day.</li>
            <li> Outstanding fragrance  especially when paired with patchouilly oil......</li>
            <li> and I love wearing it daily to work!  </li>
            <li> This perfume is exactly like the musk oil from years ago.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve come up against this with Amazon</li>
            <li> So don&#x27; waste your money and more importantly your prestige by buying this item.</li>
            <li> And the price is sooooo much more reasonable here @ $9 a bottle ... that same bottle goes for $16 in the stores.  </li>
            <li> This order came fast and the perfume was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with the concentrated cologne, and it will last 18-24 hours, easy.  </li>
            <li> It must be super old.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a classic and will never go out of style!  </li>
            <li> Not so long ago this oil was strong enough to be enjoyed all day long, but now it is so light</li>
            <li> The origina Musk perfume that has a gentle though peasant fragrance that does not overwhelm.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Yes - this is the real thing.  </li>
            <li> I have to repurchase another one again really soon.</li>
            <li> I really wanted her to use it.</li>
            <li> you have applied to much, and a scent should be a whisper, so don&#x27;t shout it out.  </li>
            <li> This was a gift for a very dear friend.</li>
            <li> it, looks of people ask me where it came from and how much i paid for it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely a fragrance that you can wear every day and not feel overpowered by the musk smell.  </li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> Goes very well with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this perfume since I was in high school, &amp; I&#x27;m 58 now!  </li>
            <li> The only reason I gave this perfume 4 stars, instead of 5, is because I prefer the original, &#x27;roll-on&#x27; applicator&lt;br /&gt;to</li>
            <li> Seems to be very similar to the original product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this on and off for many years and will not wear any other perfume/oil.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other fragrances over the years, but always choose Musk as my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Favorite perfume, hands down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s timeless and classic and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Classic.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to find the Jovan Mush Oil that I remembered from long ago....</li>
            <li> I used to wear this when I was in high school.  </li>
            <li> Highly recomend.</li>
            <li> It is a subtle, clean fragrance and does not aggravate even the most sensitive noses.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d go broke wearing this oil every day because it does require a lot more than just a little dab a day.</li>
            <li> Too bad because it used to be the best.</li>
            <li> , how can you go wrong, great price.</li>
            <li> It put a big smile on her face.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a good price since she only uses a small amount.</li>
            <li> Does not have the same fresh scent seems ..as if water was added to the Musk?</li>
            <li> This musk oil has been a favorite for a very long time and when I could not find the oil locally</li>
            <li> Very mild and not strong, I get quiet a few compliments as to how good I smell.</li>
            <li> I could not really remember how this smelled until opening it, then it was so familiar.</li>
            <li> Could it have a new recipe?</li>
            <li> My wife was looking for a new perfume for herself.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;ll need a new bottle around Christmas.</li>
            <li> Instead of using my Mom&#x27;s bottle, I decided to purchase a new bottle and keep hers as a remembrance of her.  </li>
            <li> The first purchase was beyond my expectations but this purchase was total waist of money.</li>
            <li> They are probably not aware of the original process that was used...</li>
            <li> But to me it&#x27;s the same scent as it was when I first started buying it.  </li>
            <li> But this new bottle smells NOTHING like the old stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She uses quite a few of the older perfumes like Shallimar and White Diamonds, but this Jovan Musk Oil is her favorite.</li>
            <li> Many reviewers have written that the scent is different, or doesn&#x27;t last as long.  </li>
            <li> She always has a hard time finding it in stores, so I&#x27;m glad to have found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> using it for years a soft scent that is not over powering</li>
            <li> This Musk oil last throughout  the whole day. .</li>
            <li> This is really the only musk oil I&#x27;ve ever smelled so can&#x27;t compare Musk scents.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t smell like I remembered it, maybe because it&#x27;s so old .</li>
            <li> but now it is much lighter than in recent years.</li>
            <li> This is one of my old favs that I plan on continuing to order in the years to come.</li>
            <li> I have used this musk for decades and was surprised by the change.</li>
            <li> I found an old bottle of Jovan Musk Oil in among my mom&#x27;s things after she passed away.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m surprised by this also because of the way it was packaged and shipped since it&#x27;s deemed \\&quot;HAZARDOUS\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> love this scent, and it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find!</li>
            <li> Another classic gone forever, such a shame!</li>
            <li> Very good price - less expensive that some others.</li>
            <li> This is an unusual scent that lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> They can be divided into three major classes: aromatic nitro musk, polycyclic musk compounds, and macrocyclic musk.  </li>
            <li> Bring back the old scent!  </li>
            <li> , it is still there, only more subtle.  </li>
            <li> Since obtaining the deer musk requires killing the endangered animal, nearly all musk fragrance used in perfumery today is synthetic, sometimes called \\&quot;white musk\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also received bottles with barely any fragrance to it, just oil.</li>
            <li> I do hope they bring the old back.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this perfume and there&#x27;s barely a scent</li>
            <li> last , glad I found on Amazon because it&#x27;s hard to find anymore !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep buying it because I never get tired of the original musk!</li>
            <li> I must have gotten a bad batch, because everyone else seems to be very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> is that once you place it on any part of your body it lasts all day long even until the next day.</li>
            <li> For an oil fragrance it should have long lasting smell</li>
            <li> The fragrance is not overpowering and is long lasting.</li>
            <li> The scent last as long as it always did IMO.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed and if Amazon is going to be the middle man for these sellers, I would expect them to expect more from their sellers for the sake of Loyal Customers like myself.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely loved Jovan Musk in the past but, as other reviewers have mentioned, the smell in this bottle is so faint</li>
            <li> Hard to describe really.</li>
            <li> I figured its been around so long, so I&#x27;ll give it a try.</li>
            <li> The scent lasts a long time, also.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this for a long time</li>
            <li> Oil stays on your skin for a long time without losing its scent.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this musk oil because it is not loud and can be worn throughout the day and night.  </li>
            <li> Heads up if you&#x27;re buying this stuff after a long time</li>
            <li> We were using other perfumes until we rediscovered this again recently.  </li>
            <li> Years ago, you only needed a little dab and it last all day/night.  </li>
            <li> Subtle and gentle fragrance lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read several negative comments saying that this is not the same product of some years back--this point is one I would know nothing about--and that the fragrance \\&quot;doesn&#x27;t last over five minutes\\&quot; as one writer put it.</li>
            <li> I do agree with others as to being watered down with oil which lessens the fragrance which is why I only gave 3 stars.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem as long lasting a scent as in the past.  </li>
            <li> But has been harder to find in stores</li>
            <li> I like musk even though it is really not the fragrance for today</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never returned it when there&#x27;s barely a scent so not sure about the return policy.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Other seventies nostalgics always recognize it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the other undertones.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews from other customers and from them there was no mention of Coty anywhere in their review as I had read in other Jovan Musk products descriptions and reviews.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You will never go wrong if you seek a soft, romantic, sensual fragrance!  </li>
            <li> The scent is a soft, subtle musk, not at all irritating to others who may be sensitive to scents.</li>
            <li> and it was not worth it</li>
            <li> Take a trip down memory lane ladies -</li>
            <li> bottle is small, but with musk oil, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s half gone already.</li>
            <li> 33 years ago in a small corner drugstore I picked up a bottle of Jovan Musk Oil only because I needed a small container of perfume for my purse.</li>
            <li> The application is a little drippy.</li>
            <li> And less expensive than other similarly priced brands.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to say if this is due to &amp;#34;cost saving&amp;#34; during the making, or the age of the bottle, or????.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a strong fragrance.  </li>
            <li> If anything, there&#x27;s a slight, EXTREMELY FAINT scent, similar to baby oil.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t smell like the Jovan Musk Oil that I have bought for the past 20 years.</li>
            <li> I have worn Jovan Musk Oil for the past 30+ years and always get compliments when I wear it.  </li>
            <li> Also I&#x27;ve used this for 20 yrs, Coty has always made it,so not sure why some have a issue with this since its always been that,way.</li>
            <li> usually I get it before the delivery date.</li>
            <li> She has had trouble getting it lately</li>
            <li> Jovan Musk Oil has become a disappointment in the last few years.  </li>
            <li> but, I&#x27;m disappointed, it doesn&#x27;t have much of an aroma....</li>
            <li> It is hard to find</li>
            <li> Its so hard to find this.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> i guess sometimes you get a bad or old one.</li>
            <li> at least it&#x27;s getting some use.</li>
            <li> As for myself, I have nothing negative to say about this product.  </li>
            <li> A blast from the past!</li>
            <li> Too bad it barely contains a scent and</li>
            <li> Jovan Musk Oil is so subtle and sensual and intensifies when you need it.</li>
            <li> Much less expensive on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Someone else commented that the smell is weak.  </li>
            <li> it is so weak it dissipates within minutes.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste the money even though it is inexpensive, it isnt the same product and you will be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this oil hardly contains any scent.  </li>
            <li> I decided to use it as a base oil for some of my essential oils..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind using a synthetic scent, it is unnecessary to kill an animal, just to use it&#x27;s scent glands.  </li>
            <li> Just something that you&#x27;ll never get tired of.</li>
            <li> Would give it a no start but was unable to get it to take it had to put  at least one star.</li>
            <li> It is very subtle and never overpowers.  </li>
            <li> It is either an imitation or it is so expired it is worthless.  </li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> It lasts for about 5 hours on me and then it is faint.  </li>
            <li> but it is either fake or expired fragrance.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately , my wife thought it smelled like cat urine.</li>
            <li> so knew I couldn&#x27;t go wrong with it giving it to her as a gift.</li>
            <li> It is a fake.</li>
            <li> I would have given this 5 stars but was unable to get it by my wife&#x27;s birthday.</li>
            <li> Disappointed :-/</li>
            <li> She loves musk oil and it is difficult to find them in name brand perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I was forced to buy it on line!!!!  </li>
            <li> I was rather disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> It is very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worthless.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s something there, but very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in my purchase.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
            <li> She was very disappointed as it seems to have been reformulated over the years.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Bought this as a gift, my friend loves it!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. Been wearing it for years.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely loved Jovan Musk in the past but, as other reviewers have mentioned, the smell in this bottle is so faint it&#x27;s worthless. It&#x27;s hard to say if this is due to &amp;#34;cost saving&amp;#34; during the making, or the age of the bottle, or????.  Too bad because it used to be the best. I decided to use it as a base oil for some of my essential oils.. at least it&#x27;s getting some use.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff, cheap and wonderfully smelling, the husband likes it too ;) Yea, You can&#x27;t beat that at all.</li>
            <li> The origina Musk perfume that has a gentle though peasant fragrance that does not overwhelm. The oil retains the ferfume for hours longer than alcohol based perfumes. This is the best one if you like Musk, and the size is handy for your purse if you want to freshen it up for an evening out after work.</li>
            <li> Nice product. Good smell.</li>
            <li> This was an extremely good deal on this perfume. I have worn it for over 30 years, and by far the best bargain. The amazing thing about this entire deal was the fast delivery. Record time!!</li>
            <li> Got it for my dog. They are supposed to like the smell.... So far, not really.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this perfume and the best thing is that once you place it on any part of your body it lasts all day long even until the next day.</li>
            <li> I have always loved Jovan Musk.  It&#x27;s a classic and will never go out of style!  I always get compliments when I wear it.  Definitley will buy again!  Seller was quick and great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the product and the price. thankyou</li>
            <li> I was above and beyond impressed with this order.  Arrived in about 2 days.  Thank you so much. Satisfied buyer.</li>
            <li> I was excited to find the Jovan Mush Oil that I remembered from long ago....but, I&#x27;m disappointed, it doesn&#x27;t have much of an aroma....nothing....just oil ....there&#x27;s something there, but very disappointed.  I will not purchase any more.  Sorry</li>
            <li> using it for years a soft scent that is not over powering</li>
            <li> Jovan Musk Oil has become a disappointment in the last few years.  I don&#x27;t think I will ever try again, to order it, in hopes it has gone back to what it used to be.  The smell is not the same and what is there disappears in no time.</li>
            <li> Yes - this is the real thing.  I used to wear this when I was in high school.  I am so glad I rediscovered it!  It smells the same and brings back a lot of great memories.    Someone else commented that the smell is weak.  I don&#x27;t think so.  It lasts for about 5 hours on me and then it is faint.  Such a great scent.  It&#x27;s clean, spicy and exotic.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave this perfume 4 stars, instead of 5, is because I prefer the original, &#x27;roll-on&#x27; applicator&lt;br /&gt;to this &#x27;stick&#x27; applicator. And I am not sure if it&#x27;s just me, but it seems to be watered-down compared to when&lt;br /&gt;it first came out. .  I wear it strictly for myself, it brings back happy memories of the 70s.. And I love the size,&lt;br /&gt;perfect to keep in your purse.  Note:  It is cheaper&lt;br /&gt;to buy here than it is at your local walmart or drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;I dream of a matching lotion.</li>
            <li> I have always loved Jovan&#x27;s &#x27;White Musk&#x27; spray cologne as well as the body lotion.  I&#x27;ve read several negative comments saying that this is not the same product of some years back--this point is one I would know nothing about--and that the fragrance \\&quot;doesn&#x27;t last over five minutes\\&quot; as one writer put it. Using the oil along with the spray and/or body lotion may help to intensify the fragrance and make it last longer.  As for myself, I have nothing negative to say about this product.  But, I have read that we all have different chemical makeups in our systems which can affect the way in which colognes and perfumes react on us individually.  Also, because our systems change over time and with age, what worked at one time may not work out for us now.   I happily give the oil, the cologne and the body lotion five stars, wishing I could give them each ten!  Susan R</li>
            <li> I was rather disappointed in this product. It was shipped in a timely manner but it didn&#x27;t smell like the Jovan Musk Oil that I have bought for the past 20 years. I was very disappointed. Did not even seem like the same product.                    Stacy Baugher</li>
            <li> I love this Oil!  It is so fragrant and lasts all day.  I always recieve so many compliments.  I found that if you pair Jovan Musk Oil with Coty Musk Spray it blends better than using the Jovan Musk Spray.</li>
            <li> Have used this for many years during the winter as I think it smells more like winter than summer.  But has been harder to find in stores so I ordered.  Doesn&#x27;t seem as long lasting a scent as in the past.  Could it have a new recipe?</li>
            <li> This fragrance is great for all day wear and a very mild clean scent.  And yes most men love it. I have a sensitivity to aromas and can wear this without smelling it to strongly.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a very strong smell like back in the day!</li>
            <li> Great price for this product!</li>
            <li> Always wore it. Always will</li>
            <li> Yes, it has been that long, and I have tried others, but Jovan Musk Oil is the best perfume I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;It lasts, smells wonderful, and amazingly, women and men like the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I do not buy the sprays, has to be the oil...&lt;br /&gt;If you have never tried this, you should...it is wonderful!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I buy fragrance from amazon. The first purchase was beyond my expectations but this purchase was total waist of money. I bought 3 packages to give them as gifts and gave the first one to my wife. Surprisingly, the smell is close to none. For an oil fragrance it should have long lasting smell but it is either fake or expired fragrance. So don&#x27; waste your money and more importantly your prestige by buying this item. There is no return so you are stuck.</li>
            <li> My mother always loved Coty Musk oil.  When I found out it wasn&#x27;t available, I purchased this instead.  It smells wonderful on her, and she was very pleased.</li>
            <li> use this product daily.</li>
            <li> I have to say that my mom and I love this perfume oil.  We were using other perfumes until we rediscovered this again recently.  She used perfume oils back in the day.  The scent smells great without being overpowering like other scents.  It&#x27;s nice and mild.  We love it.  I have to repurchase another one again really soon.</li>
            <li> This is the only scent I have ever been able to wear (everything else gives me a headache), and I gave up wearing anything when I didn&#x27;t see it in stores anymore.  It was wonderful to find it here and it is as good as it always was.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I wanted and had no luck finding it here!</li>
            <li> My wife was looking for a new perfume for herself. I recalled that I always loved the scent of Jovan musk oil back in the seventies (I think every man did). We got it and it smelled exactly as I remembered, and it was oil and the scent lingered all day. A little goes a long way. Unfortunately , my wife thought it smelled like cat urine. What a bummer. I really wanted her to use it. Believe me, it can turn things on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Jovan For Women since 1974. It&#x27;s still pretty good in my opinion, but believe me, the formula has definitely changed. I still get compliments when I wear it, but I wish they would return to the original formula. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.  I remember this scent from many years ago and how much I liked it.  Unfortunately, this oil hardly contains any scent.  The scent is gone before I even leave the house.  I must have gotten a bad batch, because everyone else seems to be very satisfied.  I tossed mine into the trash.</li>
            <li> This smells nothing like the Jovan Musk Oil of the 70&#x27;s....I don&#x27;t even know how to describe this...my daughter said I smelled like AC Moore! It smells \\&quot;old\\&quot; and stinky is all I can say. So sad, used to love this stuff, I guess they manufacture it differently now. Don&#x27;t waste the money even though it is inexpensive, it isnt the same product and you will be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I have used Jovan Musk for years......  CVS use to sell it as well as Walmart.....  Unfortunately both do not stock this item any more.  I was forced to buy it on line!!!!  Why do you no longer sell it in stores???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is Fabulous.  It is one of your best products.  No perfume smell, just a clean smell and I get complimented every time i wear it.Please put it back in the stores.</li>
            <li> I find that you can put it on and in 15 seconds it has no fragrance.  Not made like the Musk Oil I used many years ago.&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended.</li>
            <li> This order came fast and the perfume was exactly what I wanted. Sine they no longer make the original Skin oil perfume I have switched to Jovan Musk and it&#x27;s as close to the scent I&#x27;ve worn since being a teenager many many years ago...lol If your looking for a good musk perfume then this is the one!!</li>
            <li> A blast from the past!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Jovan Musk for years.  I love it!  It&#x27;s not a strong fragrance.  Many people have told me that I smell good.  In fact, someone told me yesterday.  I guess I would say it&#x27;s a clean fragrance.</li>
            <li> Always loved this. Can&#x27;t find it any more. Will have to order more. It&#x27;s half gone already.</li>
            <li> Outstanding fragrance  especially when paired with patchouilly oil......</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this &amp;#34;Jovan Musk&amp;#34; in the package.  But it quickly faded, because this &#x27;Musk Oil&#x27; has NO scent whatsoever.  If anything, there&#x27;s a slight, EXTREMELY FAINT scent, similar to baby oil. But even baby oil smells stronger than this stuff.  The box was sealed in shrink wrap, but it makes me wonder if this was something left over from the 1970&#x27;s. I&#x27;ve asked several people to smell it, and they all said the same thing . . . no scent or the slightest scent of baby oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t return it, because it&#x27;s classified as a &amp;#34;hazardous material,&amp;#34; but I doubt this stuff could kill anything . . .  Very disappointed. Won&#x27;t buy anything else from this source.</li>
            <li> This musk oil has been a favorite for a very long time and when I could not find the oil locally I check with amazon and its just as pleasant as ever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Jovan musk oil for years ,it&#x27;s the only thing I can use that doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies.The oil is much better and lasts longer than the spray.It has a very clean smell and constantly people tell me how good I smell.I was glad I found it on Amazon and saved myself some money.</li>
            <li> It came close but It&#x27;s just not the original scent I was looking for.  But it&#x27;s on the right track...</li>
            <li> This is my mom&#x27;s favorite so knew I couldn&#x27;t go wrong with it giving it to her as a gift. It is the reliable standby musk oil that lasts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s That good. I&#x27;ve been wearing since the 1970&#x27;s. Have people tell me all the time how good I smell. I like it myself too.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get it into nz</li>
            <li> This Musk oil last throughout  the whole day. . It is not to over powering.Nice light smell</li>
            <li> I like musk even though it is really not the fragrance for today but it is a nice soft fragerance .  I have seasonal asthma and this fragrance is not offensive and doesn&#x27;t trigger an asthma or allergy attack.</li>
            <li> I have used this perfume since the mid 1970&#x27;s, and it remains my true favorite . Jovan has kept the same formula, and not messed around with fads, giving me a mellow smellow that keeps on making me happy.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite musk oil.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is not overpowering and is long lasting. The application is a little drippy. Very good price - less expensive that some others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing the Body Shop&#x27;s white musk since 2000. I have no desire to change it. But, in 2006 they changed the formula to something weaker and different. Then, last year, they discontinued it all together. What am I to do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember Jovan as a wanna-be teenager in the mimd-80&#x27;s. I figured its been around so long, so I&#x27;ll give it a try. It&#x27;s good. It&#x27;s definitely a different scent than the Body Shop white musk, but it lasts longer than their weaker 2006 version and I&#x27;ve yet to find a better alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing: the packaging seems great for travel, but it leaks. It even leaks when it falls over in my make-up box, which isn&#x27;t great, because it&#x27;s not really designed to stand up. What&#x27;s a girl to do? This is good for now. If anyone has found a better alternative to Body Shop&#x27;s original White Musk, please respond to this message!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Jovan Musk Oil by Jovan For Women.  CVS use to sell this, but I can not find it there anymore. I am so happy to know that I can get it at Amazon and that the price is just right!  Thank you for making products avaiable that no one else seems to carry!  This is my all time favorite scent and I love wearing it daily to work!  It is my work fragrance because it is not too strong and over bearing.  Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> Many reviewers have written that the scent is different, or doesn&#x27;t last as long.  They are probably not aware of the original process that was used...Since obtaining the deer musk requires killing the endangered animal, nearly all musk fragrance used in perfumery today is synthetic, sometimes called \\&quot;white musk\\&quot;. They can be divided into three major classes: aromatic nitro musk, polycyclic musk compounds, and macrocyclic musk.  I don&#x27;t mind using a synthetic scent, it is unnecessary to kill an animal, just to use it&#x27;s scent glands.  This smells close to what I wore in the 70&#x27;s, it&#x27;s has the same \\&quot;musky\\&quot; scent.  A note to those who can&#x27;t smell the scent later in the day, it is still there, only more subtle.  If you can still smell a scent 5 hours after you have put it on,  you have applied to much, and a scent should be a whisper, so don&#x27;t shout it out.  I did purchase the \\&quot;sold by Amazon\\&quot; product, and I received the original Jovan box as pictured.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a very dear friend. It was a all time favorite. It put a big smile on her face.</li>
            <li> I have been using Jovan Musk oil for about 30 years  now and I still get compliments on how good I smell!!</li>
            <li> I have this scents for over 40 years. I still used it. Just something that you&#x27;ll never get tired of.</li>
            <li> Seems to be very similar to the original product.</li>
            <li> Order this item over and over. Superb! Takes me back to the wonderful seventies! Great price. Other seventies nostalgics always recognize it. Well loved scent.</li>
            <li> been looking for this for ever&lt;br /&gt;lov it, looks of people ask me where it came from and how much i paid for it. lov it!!</li>
            <li> 33 years ago in a small corner drugstore I picked up a bottle of Jovan Musk Oil only because I needed a small container of perfume for my purse. It was the most significant impulse buy I have ever made. Not a day goes buy that someone doesn&#x27;t compliment me or ask what scent I am wearing. My Granny always told me to pick one perfume and stay with it because whenever someone smells it they will think of you.  Believe me when I tell you it is true..Family...Friends...and Oh Yes...Lovers! Jovan Musk Oil is so subtle and sensual and intensifies when you need it. I believe it is the 8th wonder of the world. It is hard to find so I always order online at Amazon...easy...fast...and phenomenal service.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a friend. Much less expensive on Amazon. Now  we know why. It is a fake. She has been wearing Jovan musk for years. She noticed the difference. Buyer Beware.</li>
            <li> My wife use this product since many years ago, and she likes very much because it smell very good. I like the smell also</li>
            <li> This is the same Jovan Musk I wore as a teenage and am coming back to it again.  The only difference is that I seem to remember it lasting longer in those days.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> I would have given this 5 stars but was unable to get it by my wife&#x27;s birthday. Received 5 days after.</li>
            <li> Absolutely a fragrance that you can wear every day and not feel overpowered by the musk smell.  I love it!</li>
            <li> When I got it in and gave it to my wife she opened it. We found that there was no scent to it. I ordered 3 bottles and none of them was any good   Would give it a no start but was unable to get it to take it had to put  at least one star. The good thing is   there was no issue in getting a refund. Like alwas Amazon stood  be hind it and made sure everything was right</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with the concentrated cologne, and it will last 18-24 hours, easy.  I have people commenting on my scent all the time, and it is result of using the oil w/the cologne.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I love this one.</li>
            <li> I have worn Jovan Musk Oil for the past 30+ years and always get compliments when I wear it.  It is a subtle, clean fragrance and does not aggravate even the most sensitive noses.  I can not wear floral or overly potent perfumes as they give me a headache.  I can only hope that Jovan Musk Oil will be made for the next 30+ years.</li>
            <li> I got it very fast. With the item I recieved bunch of samples!&lt;br /&gt;The oil smells awesome and last a long time!&lt;br /&gt;Great to get it as a gift.</li>
            <li> I have stood in line at Starbucks and men and women have gone out of their way to ask what the fragrance was that I was wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will never go wrong if you seek a soft, romantic, sensual fragrance!  I would not buy anything else!</li>
            <li> This musk I love.....I been using it forever love it!!</li>
            <li> Amazon is where I found this product at a very low price. This is why I purchased 3 of them. The scent is light, refreshing, &amp; it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this scent for years.  I don&#x27;t like department store fragrances.  I was very happy to find this cologne on line and at a great price.</li>
            <li> Smells good. But as the discrition says (musk oil) well it not, for I know what original musk oil is.</li>
            <li> love this scent, and it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find!</li>
            <li> I love musk. Just not this brand. I don&#x27;t care for the other undertones.</li>
            <li> Wow, I opened this bottle and the smell took me straight back to the 70s when this was very popular. I could not really remember how this smelled until opening it, then it was so familiar. This is really the only musk oil I&#x27;ve ever smelled so can&#x27;t compare Musk scents. This is not &amp;#34;musky&amp;#34; like patchouli but more of a sweet smell but not flowery. Hard to describe really. But I love it.</li>
            <li> For over 50 years, my favorite!</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite fragrance. Great product.</li>
            <li> Favorite perfume, hands down. The only one I wear. Pleasant and non-offensive scent. Not overpowering at all. Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this on and off for many years and will not wear any other perfume/oil.  I do agree with others as to being watered down with oil which lessens the fragrance which is why I only gave 3 stars.  I&#x27;ve also received bottles with barely any fragrance to it, just oil. It is very disappointing.  Years ago, you only needed a little dab and it last all day/night.  I do hope they bring the old back.  None the less, it&#x27;s a great perfume/oil and love it. I will continue to purchase and wear occasionally. Thankfully the spray hasn&#x27;t changed otherwise I&#x27;d go broke wearing this oil every day because it does require a lot more than just a little dab a day.</li>
            <li> LOVE MY JAVON PERFUM OIL!  WON&#x27;T USE ANYTHING ELSE.  THE PRICE WAS RIGHT AND FIT INTO MY BUDGET.  wILL PURCHASE AGAIN AND AGAIN AS I NEED IT.  THANKS</li>
            <li> I love this. I have used it for many years with no disappointment. Highly recomend. Also I&#x27;ve used this for 20 yrs, Coty has always made it,so not sure why some have a issue with this since its always been that,way.</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragrance, lasts all day. Never offensive. I have been complimented on this many times. It&#x27;s Purse size container  is also a plus for travel.</li>
            <li> yes! I will buy another! for me, the smell makes me sensual, soft and pleasant  I like,Next time I&#x27;ll buy bigger</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Jovan Musk for years.  It is very subtle and never overpowers.  The scent lasts a long time, also.</li>
            <li> Have used Johan for years</li>
            <li> I love this scent so bought from this supplier before and it was ok. NOW nothing but oil. No scent. Total rip off knowing you can not return. Do not do business with this seller</li>
            <li> Something about this Musk Oil is not quite right,,,smell doesn&#x27;t last at all...maybe it is an imposter...not sure...would not purchase online again...</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite scent since I was 15 !  So happy Jovan is still making this. I love the scent and always receive compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife&#x27;s wish list.  She&#x27;s very happy with her gift.</li>
            <li> this has a light smell that doesnt stay. I have bought this at the drugstore and it was nothing like this. It is either an imitation or it is so expired it is worthless.  I ordered it for the price and it was not worth it</li>
            <li> Have loved this scent for years.  Subtle and gentle fragrance lasts all day.</li>
            <li> All was done properly. To be recommended</li>
            <li> Classic sent always good</li>
            <li> I love this perfume oil . Musk is  the no.1 note In my book&lt;br /&gt;I love love Jovan musk oil&lt;br /&gt;You may not smell the scent but everyone will</li>
            <li> Nice soft scent and has a stick to apply with and it last , glad I found on Amazon because it&#x27;s hard to find anymore !</li>
            <li> Came with NO SCENT!  I have been wearing this for a long time so I know what it smells like but this bottle arrived with no scent. I thought maybe it had expired but I couldnt find an expiration date. Disappointed :-/</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t smell like I remembered it, maybe because it&#x27;s so old .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Musk.  This is the absolute best one in my opinion, reminds me of my teenage years.</li>
            <li> she loves, I love it. period</li>
            <li> Love. Love. Love. Nothing sexier than musk.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great scent!! Soft, NEVER too strong, sensual &amp; attracting. It gets noticed without being overpowering. Have loved it for 30+ years!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  This perfume has no fragrance at all!  It must be super old.  Very disappointed in my purchase.  Never again!!</li>
            <li> Jovan Musk Oil reeks.  Of all the ones that had were pleasant, it seems rather sadistic that this is the one still on the market, while others are asking that Coty Wild Musk and others be brought back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave this one a try about a week ago, and it was overpowering and has/had zero appeal.</li>
            <li> Jovan Musk Oil still smells the same but now it is much lighter than in recent years. Not so long ago this oil was strong enough to be enjoyed all day long, but now it is so light it can&#x27;t even be enjoyed by the person wearing it. Another classic gone forever, such a shame!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s timeless and classic and lasts all day. I used to wear it in the 70&#x27;s and was happy to see it was still around. The scent is a soft, subtle musk, not at all irritating to others who may be sensitive to scents.</li>
            <li> este es un producto que uso hace mas de 35 años y todavia lo consigo y es mi olor favorito</li>
            <li> I love the smell of musk oil.  It does not have a strong smell very light and that is what I like about it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume.  I saw some reviews where posters stated it wasn&#x27;t the same as the oil in the 70&#x27;s.  I never used it back then.  But to me it&#x27;s the same scent as it was when I first started buying it.  And the price is sooooo much more reasonable here @ $9 a bottle ... that same bottle goes for $16 in the stores.  The scent last as long as it always did IMO.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Jovan Musk Oil for many years and still love it.  I&#x27;ve tried other fragrances over the years, but always choose Musk as my favorite.  People always compliment me on my fragance and want to know what I&#x27;m wearing.  I also use the cologne spray for everyday and save the oil for times when I really want it to stay with me because it is longlasting.</li>
            <li> I love Jovan Musk Oil I&#x27;ve been using it for years and I still have people ask what I&#x27;m wearing. Love the product and the price, you won&#x27;t find it any cheaper anywhere. Service is great usually I get it before the delivery date.</li>
            <li> This item was purchased for my mother as a Christmas gift. She loves musk oil and it is difficult to find them in name brand perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is small, but with musk oil, a little goes a long way. She loved her gift!</li>
            <li> Grandma Shirley loves this perfume and the oil really lasts a long time and she smells great in this, she looks forward to getting this every Chrismas!</li>
            <li> love the oil I mix with men aftershave  I love the smell together I get lots of complaints. I get more use from the oil than the spray.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite, how can you go wrong, great price.</li>
            <li> I have always loved the way this smells, before and after application! Like the oil too, have only used sprays before.</li>
            <li> This perfume is exactly like the musk oil from years ago. Oil stays on your skin for a long time without losing its scent.</li>
            <li> Take a trip down memory lane ladies - I know most of us wore this in the 70&#x27;s, it is just fabulous still</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this since 1978.  I get compliments all the time on how nice I smell.  :)</li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it for years. Goes very well with my body chemistry. Also have allergies and this is the only perfume I have found that does not set off my allergies. Very mild and not strong, I get quiet a few compliments as to how good I smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this perfume since I was in high school, &amp; I&#x27;m 58 now!  I still love it, &amp; it&#x27;s much cheaper on Amazon than anywhere else.  :)</li>
            <li> Great price. I love this scent.</li>
            <li> I love this musk oil because it&#x27;s not overpowering, but yet nice enough that I always get compliments when I wear it. This is one of my old favs that I plan on continuing to order in the years to come.</li>
            <li> When I was a teen my mother got me a Jovan bath set.&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo, talc, and a bar of soap.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly they no longer make these items.&lt;br /&gt;Happily there are &amp;#34;How to&amp;#34; recipes all over the net and I was able to make my own using the oil :-)</li>
            <li> my wife loves this perfume....She has had trouble getting it lately and she is now very happy.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this musk oil because it is not loud and can be worn throughout the day and night.  The purchase was well worth the price.</li>
            <li> My mom is heading towards 70. She thinks she&#x27;s 50. The perfume oil does seem to react well to her. I&#x27;ve been to the grocery store with her and heard people compliment and ask what she&#x27;s wearing. She uses quite a few of the older perfumes like Shallimar and White Diamonds, but this Jovan Musk Oil is her favorite. I usually don&#x27;t like musk, but this has a very light scent and is kind of airy. She always has a hard time finding it in stores, so I&#x27;m glad to have found it on Amazon. For those who haven&#x27;t tried it, you should give it a shot, she says her mom used it and she uses it, all of her sisters use it. Seems to be a good price since she only uses a small amount. She&#x27;ll need a new bottle around Christmas.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite scents but I wished they made White Musk oil.  It is not over bearing &amp; makes for a nice scent.</li>
            <li> I think this may have been diluted with a sweeter perfume.  Still has musk but not like the last one I purchased at a drug store.  I have used this musk for decades and was surprised by the change.</li>
            <li> Great Mother&#x27;s Day gift. Has a very distinct scent that I will recommend to others. Very easy to apply to your skin as well.</li>
            <li> This is the only fragrance I can use that does not bother my allergies.  Love the smell!  I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> This has been a favorite of mines for years.  Still fresh smelling and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I loved this scent. Too bad it barely contains a scent and it is so weak it dissipates within minutes.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I love the oil, its heavenly</li>
            <li> Wonderful and the price was great compared to where I normally buy it from!</li>
            <li> Does not have the same fresh scent seems ..as if water was added to the Musk?</li>
            <li> This is a great standby and I always get compliments when I wear it. I keep the oil and spray both on hand.</li>
            <li> Its so hard to find this. Ive used it for 30 years. had not seen it in the store for about 10 years. then found it on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,</li>
            <li> This is an unusual scent that lasts a long time.  It is hard to find in stores.  Will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I love musk but it&#x27;s hit or miss. I&#x27;ve bought this perfume and there&#x27;s barely a scent and then others times the scent is perfect and I can&#x27;t get enough of it.  I&#x27;ve never returned it when there&#x27;s barely a scent so not sure about the return policy. So beware...i guess sometimes you get a bad or old one. I&#x27;ll keep buying it because I never get tired of the original musk!</li>
            <li> I found an old bottle of Jovan Musk Oil in among my mom&#x27;s things after she passed away.  I had always loved the scent and wanted to wear it.  Instead of using my Mom&#x27;s bottle, I decided to purchase a new bottle and keep hers as a remembrance of her.  But this new bottle smells NOTHING like the old stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did they change it?  It&#x27;s definitely NOT what it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JOVAN - are you reading this?  Bring back the old scent!  It was infinitely better than this krap.</li>
            <li> Ordered this product on my Iphone and the description was incomplete. It said nothing saying it was a \\&quot;Coty\\&quot; product, but that it was Jovan Musk Oil by JOVAN. I read the reviews from other customers and from them there was no mention of Coty anywhere in their review as I had read in other Jovan Musk products descriptions and reviews. I opened the package when I received it and as soon as I saw it I knew it WAS NOT BY JOVAN! Didn&#x27;t even have to take it out of the box to know. Very disappointed and it&#x27;s catagorized as \\&quot;Hazardous Waste\\&quot; so it it non-returnable. And I&#x27;m surprised by this also because of the way it was packaged and shipped since it&#x27;s deemed \\&quot;HAZARDOUS\\&quot;. This is the first time I&#x27;ve come up against this with Amazon and I won&#x27;t stop ordering things from them, but I also won&#x27;t be ordering things like this through them. Very disappointed and if Amazon is going to be the middle man for these sellers, I would expect them to expect more from their sellers for the sake of Loyal Customers like myself.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume and I can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore. I love it.</li>
            <li> I love Jovan. And less expensive than other similarly priced brands. OIL!</li>
            <li> Classic.  Wish she wore it more often.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother, as she told me she used to love Jovan Musk years ago.  I was so excited to give this to her, and she was so excited to receive it -- until she tried it on.  She was very disappointed as it seems to have been reformulated over the years.  It&#x27;s not a BAD scent, but it&#x27;s not what she remembered or wanted.  Heads up if you&#x27;re buying this stuff after a long time -- it&#x27;s just not the same formula.</li>
