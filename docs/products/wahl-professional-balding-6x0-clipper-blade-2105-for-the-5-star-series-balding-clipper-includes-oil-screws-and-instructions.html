            <li>At this price, if you cut your own dogs hair, it is worth having a set of these on the shelf.  </li>
            <li>Gave the most comfortable cut that Ive had in three years, even better than the original blade that the Wahl Bald Fader came with.</li>

            <li>I put on the original blades again and again.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if these are original Wahl blades or not but</li>
            <li>but it does not work as well as the original.</li>

            <li>It works well and cuts cleanly.</li>
            <li>Glad I came upon this instead of being a whole need balding clipper.</li>
            <li>Sweet.</li>

            <li>Didn&#x27;t realize my current Wahl clippers were compatible, as I&#x27;m sure most are.</li>
            <li>The balding clipper replacement blade is a worthy investment in the life of your balding clippers.  </li>
            <li>i cut myself if i&#x27;m to handy with my hickory O_o</li>
            <li>I should have got these earlier, clippers are good as new again gives a clean cut</li>
            <li>I was nice to finally give a cut with them.</li>
            <li>Also, these blades seem to require more frequent cleaning with the brush while using them to keep them clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The package was easy to open and they were easy to install.</li>
            <li>8-10 not quite super pro but very close...</li>
            <li>It cut very very close with no nicks to the skin.</li>
            <li>It was better than I thought it would be, buzzed my head right down to the skin ( comfortably )</li>
            <li>Cuts hair like a hot knife to butter.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve bought replacement blades for my balding clipper.  </li>
            <li>and I noticed the blade extended higher than the guard, resulting in a rather severe irritation to my skin.</li>
            <li>I feel as I got ripped off for the first time</li>
            <li>And they cut like a hot knife thru butter.  </li>
            <li>The package came sooner than they said it would and was exactly what I ordered.&lt;br</li>
            <li>make sure you get the correct size this item didn&#x27;t quite fit my clipper, but I was able to work with the big half</li>

            <li>The item purchased has met all my expectations, and I would gladly purchase this item again in the very near future.</li>
            <li>nuff really said&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this &amp;#34;balding&amp;#34; blade for a standard 2 hole Wahl clipper, with the hope that is Would fit.</li>
            <li>The blades cut VERY close.</li>
            <li>Product delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>This is the only place I could find the blades that fit  the five star pro clippers</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and was what I exprcted</li>
            <li>These blades are to replace the original blades at a later time.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than buying a new clipper!</li>
            <li>Great buy to replace the old, dull blade!</li>
            <li>Now my clippers work like new!</li>
            <li>This clipper blade works great, much cheaper than buying those expensive $200+</li>
            <li>: These blades are slightly more sensitive to the bolt tightness compared to other Wahl blade sets.  </li>
            <li>Very High Graded Blade and will reccomend it to a professional who is looking for a relibile Wahl clipper blade</li>
            <li>Beats buying a new set of clippers.</li>
            <li>I purchased a new Wahl balding clipper and proceeded to drop it on my tile floor in the bathroom and chipped the blade.  </li>
            <li>But when I put on these new clippers I received from CBS Express.</li>
            <li>These replacement blades made it like new again.</li>
            <li>I was going to buy new clippers</li>
            <li>and I highly recommended to professional barber.</li>
            <li>professional clippers to get the short cut, worked right out of the package on my $15 Wahl clippers.</li>
            <li>Exactly the same blades that came with the hair clipper.</li>
            <li>I really needed this quickly but it indicated a week and a half to deliver.  </li>
            <li>Super sharp compared to the ones I replaced.&lt;br /&gt;FIt</li>
            <li>This blade went on seamlessly and was even pre-oiled.</li>
            <li>So far it has done the job and done it well.</li>
            <li>I finish with a soft close stubble.</li>
            <li>These have held up so far</li>
            <li>A must buy for the professional or home barber.</li>
            <li>we had to replace the blade and the local beauty store was too high price or did not have item.</li>
            <li>Easy to install only took a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Super sharp, adjust it all the way back</li>
            <li>I decided to purchase the Wahl 8110 balding clipper brand new because my previous 5 star wahl balding clipper made way too much noise and rattling with these blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shave was exactly what I wanted, as closed as you can get without using an actual razor.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed, my old blades got every dull and now my baldings look brand new.</li>
            <li>Obviously it is sharp so just be aware of that as I knicked myself several times while using it.</li>
            <li>does not cute, pinches, does not work right withe the clippers.  </li>

            <li> I really needed this quickly but it indicated a week and a half to deliver.  </li>
            <li> Super sharp compared to the ones I replaced.&lt;br /&gt;FIt</li>
            <li> This blade went on seamlessly and was even pre-oiled.</li>
            <li> So far it has done the job and done it well.</li>
            <li> I finish with a soft close stubble.</li>
            <li> These have held up so far</li>
            <li> A must buy for the professional or home barber.</li>
            <li> we had to replace the blade and the local beauty store was too high price or did not have item.</li>
            <li> Easy to install only took a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Super sharp, adjust it all the way back</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase the Wahl 8110 balding clipper brand new because my previous 5 star wahl balding clipper made way too much noise and rattling with these blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shave was exactly what I wanted, as closed as you can get without using an actual razor.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed, my old blades got every dull and now my baldings look brand new.</li>
            <li> Obviously it is sharp so just be aware of that as I knicked myself several times while using it.</li>
            <li> does not cute, pinches, does not work right withe the clippers.  </li>
            <li> The reason for this replacement was that the original rusted out pretty badly.</li>
            <li> Only strange thing is Amazon&#x27;s estimated shipping time.  </li>
            <li> Im a professional hairstylist and was a little worried about the blades being legit.  </li>
            <li> It is razor sharp, so be careful, but it definitely works!</li>
            <li> Paid a lot less than I did with last replacement set purchased in beauty store</li>
            <li> My old one had a broken tooth and was barely usable.</li>
            <li> minus the lack of cake and grilled cheese.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You do have to be careful however because it can cut you.</li>
            <li> sharp.</li>
            <li> But be very careful they are sharp as described.</li>
            <li> Blades are very sharp so be careful and pay attention when you are installing them and keeping them centered.</li>
            <li> Hard to find ESPECIALLY at this price.</li>
            <li> I am using it but not sure for how long.</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace my blades that are worn out from 5 years of use and they are very sharp.</li>
            <li> This blade is very sharp and cuts like a dream.  </li>
            <li> Very very sharp.</li>
            <li> It is very sharp but take caution if you plan on shaving with this blade being that it could cause itching and discomfort.</li>
            <li> It took less than a minute to swap them out.</li>
            <li> Did not fit my clipper</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a few months in after swapping this in to my Wahl 5 star clipper.  </li>
            <li> So for all those that have trouble adjusting, I am giving you the heads up the blades are defective its not your fault as the seller tried to blame it on my side.</li>
            <li> I really hate to give this a bad review considering the clippers were so great before I had to replace the blade.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how dull mine had gotten over a few years.  </li>
            <li> These came pre-oiled and they come with a small bottle of oil as well.</li>
            <li> it is you are not sure how to do this.</li>
            <li> there are no complaints of this in the past.</li>
            <li> Not sure why</li>
            <li> Again the same horrible Rattle and loud noise!!!!</li>
            <li> When I found out my Wahl color pro blades got dull, and need of sharpening it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure where the fault is, but when I replaced the blade to the balding clippers and proceeded to shave my head, it was very painful and my scalp got very tender and burned (on the verge of bleeding).</li>
            <li> The new blade is almost idiot proof with regards to installation.</li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to oil them up before you start cutting your hair.</li>
            <li> I dropped my clippers and the blade was actually cutting me.  </li>
            <li> and they weren&#x27;t to bad to adjust when they were installed</li>
            <li> Wrong blades were delivered!!</li>

            <li> Hard to find ESPECIALLY at this price. Cuts hair like a hot knife to butter.</li>
            <li> These blades are to replace the original blades at a later time. Can only rate them upon using them. That may be a while.</li>
            <li> These worked perfect for my wahl 5 star trimmer. Blades are very sharp so be careful and pay attention when you are installing them and keeping them centered.</li>

            <li> Good one for sure and I highly recommended to professional barber.</li>
            <li> we had to replace the blade and the local beauty store was too high price or did not have item. went on line found them it was perfect fit  will buy another set to have on standby.</li>
            <li> exactly what I ordered and works great</li>
            <li> closest shave I have found.  Just like the one that came with the device.  Very easy to install.</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly on my Wahl 5 star balding clippers.  This blade is very sharp and cuts like a dream.  Thank YOU for your wonderful product at such a great price.</li>
            <li> Not enough adjustment in the blades... it cuts skin. not bad, but it does.&lt;br /&gt;cuts hair but not as good as the original blade. (said it was a fit on the site)</li>
            <li> This clipper blade works great, much cheaper than buying those expensive $200+ professional clippers to get the short cut, worked right out of the package on my $15 Wahl clippers.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I dropped my clippers and chip blade. I had my clippers for 6 years and never once did I think to change the blades. These came pre-oiled and they come with a small bottle of oil as well.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Very very sharp. Align these correctly and enjoy!</li>
            <li> Great ! Very happy with my purchase !</li>
            <li> Very High Graded Blade and will reccomend it to a professional who is looking for a relibile Wahl clipper blade</li>
            <li> This blade worked out nicely.  Needed a zero gap blade for our Lithium Ion Cordless clipper set(http://www.amazon.com/Wahl-79600-2101-Lithium-Cordless-Clipper/dp/B0058SY1X6/ref&#x3D;sr_1_14?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1440265696&amp;sr&#x3D;1-14) and this was a perfect fit.  You do have to be careful however because it can cut you.</li>
            <li> This is a great set of bolding clipper replacement blades easy to exchange blades on clippers, and makes them just like new again.</li>
            <li> Fits perfect with Wahl Balding Clippers.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, fits perfectly.  Comes well oiled.  Would buy again.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve bought replacement blades for my balding clipper.  I had to after I dropped it and broke the edge.  I didn&#x27;t realize how dull mine had gotten over a few years.  Beats buying a new set of clippers.</li>
            <li> Did not fit my clipper</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace my blade on the balding clippers. This blade went on seamlessly and was even pre-oiled. So far it has done the job and done it well. Obviously it is sharp so just be aware of that as I knicked myself several times while using it. I will definitely purchase again when the time comes.</li>
            <li> I purchased a new Wahl balding clipper and proceeded to drop it on my tile floor in the bathroom and chipped the blade.  Thankfully this blade was available on Amazon for a great price shipping included.  Only strange thing is Amazon&#x27;s estimated shipping time.  I really needed this quickly but it indicated a week and a half to deliver.  Thankfully it really did take more like 4 days which worked great.</li>
            <li> I bought this &amp;#34;balding&amp;#34; blade for a standard 2 hole Wahl clipper, with the hope that is Would fit. It is good! You have to make sure to align the blades correctly.&lt;br /&gt;The blades provide the closest shave I have ever gotten. The blades cut VERY close. I finish with a soft close stubble. The way a razor shave feels on the second day.&lt;br /&gt;ALIGN THE BLADES CORRECTLY!&lt;br /&gt;YouTube it is you are not sure how to do this.</li>
            <li> very good and sen me in time thank you.</li>
            <li> Exellent product worked great totally happy. Completely satisfied with what I bought, definitely worth it four out of five stars.</li>
            <li> It fits my balding clippers perfectly. The reason for this replacement was that the original rusted out pretty badly. These have held up so far and it&#x27;s been several months of constant use.</li>
            <li> Exactly the same blades that came with the hair clipper. Paid a lot less than I did with last replacement set purchased in beauty store</li>
            <li> make sure you get the correct size this item didn&#x27;t quite fit my clipper, but I was able to work with the big half so I kept it and my clipper work fine.</li>
            <li> Quick service! Great product! Thank you</li>
            <li> so glad you guys have these no one else did. I use them for my dog who gets a cut every 4 weeks. I was nice to finally give a cut with them. The price is great and even the free shipping thank you thank you</li>
            <li> I bought these for my two screw head doggie clippers, and she was really happy.  At this price, if you cut your own dogs hair, it is worth having a set of these on the shelf.  I would imagine they would also work well on people.</li>
            <li> These work great.  I&#x27;m a few months in after swapping this in to my Wahl 5 star clipper.  I recommend it if you&#x27;re looking for a close shave</li>
            <li> The blade was just ok.  It is very sharp but take caution if you plan on shaving with this blade being that it could cause itching and discomfort.</li>
            <li> Great buy to replace the old, dull blade! This fit the clippers perfectly. It is razor sharp, so be careful, but it definitely works! Much cheaper than buying a new clipper!</li>
            <li> The item purchased has met all my expectations, and I would gladly purchase this item again in the very near future.</li>
            <li> I got these instead of sharpening my existing blades... (I don&#x27;t think they sharpen well since they are plated). These fit the Wahl Wahl Professional 8110 5-star Series Balding Clippers great!</li>
            <li> I really hate to give this a bad review considering the clippers were so great before I had to replace the blade. I&#x27;m not sure where the fault is, but when I replaced the blade to the balding clippers and proceeded to shave my head, it was very painful and my scalp got very tender and burned (on the verge of bleeding). I looked at the blade and I noticed the blade extended higher than the guard, resulting in a rather severe irritation to my skin. Assuming I did something wrong, I tried to redo the process of replacing the blade 3-4 more times only to get the same results. I had to stay in from work the next day because my scalp was irritated. I can&#x27;t figure out for the life of me how this could happen considering there are no complaints of this in the past. Just thought I&#x27;d share my story so everyone here can be cautious.</li>
            <li> My old one had a broken tooth and was barely usable. The new blade is almost idiot proof with regards to installation. It works well and cuts cleanly.</li>
            <li> Glad I came upon this instead of being a whole need balding clipper. Didn&#x27;t realize my current Wahl clippers were compatible, as I&#x27;m sure most are. The shave was exactly what I wanted, as closed as you can get without using an actual razor. Sweet.</li>
            <li> The balding clipper replacement blade is a worthy investment in the life of your balding clippers.  A must buy for the professional or home barber.</li>
            <li> Product delivery was fast. Clipper blade was easy to install and performed well. It cut very very close with no nicks to the skin.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed, my old blades got every dull and now my baldings look brand new. Easy to install only took a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Product as advertised on Amazon used it the same day. Lines up Perfect on the Wahl Bald Fader. Gave the most comfortable cut that Ive had in three years, even better than the original blade that the Wahl Bald Fader came with.</li>
            <li> 8-10 not quite super pro but very close...They have the adjustment screw on the side which I am not a fan of nor do any pro clipper have this ....</li>
            <li> This is the only place I could find the blades that fit  the five star pro clippers</li>
            <li> I bought some wireless wahl clippers and needed a closer cut, bought these balding blades and they do the job!</li>
            <li> After many hours of trying to adjust the blades and failed attempts. I decided to purchase the Wahl 8110 balding clipper brand new because my previous 5 star wahl balding clipper made way too much noise and rattling with these blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I recieved the new clipper it worked flawlessly and noise was a bear minimum. Great Clipper... But when I put on these new clippers I received from CBS Express. Again the same horrible Rattle and loud noise!!!! I put on the original blades again and again. No noise and perfect cut. This is how I realized that these blades are Flaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CBS Express declined to give a refund so I filed a Claim. I don&#x27;t know if these are original Wahl blades or not but either way they came out to be defective on my end. So for all those that have trouble adjusting, I am giving you the heads up the blades are defective its not your fault as the seller tried to blame it on my side.</li>
            <li> Pros: Nice close shave with no poking or cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: These blades are slightly more sensitive to the bolt tightness compared to other Wahl blade sets.  These are very easy to over-tighten.  Also, these blades seem to require more frequent cleaning with the brush while using them to keep them clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: These blades fit both my Wahl &#x27;two-bolt&#x27; trimmers, neither of which was a &#x27;Balding&#x27; trimmer (a Color Pro and a Home Pro).</li>
            <li> Wrong blades were delivered!!</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and was what I exprcted</li>
            <li> Not sure why but it does not work as well as the original. I am using it but not sure for how long.</li>
            <li> i dropped my clipper had a chipped the original blade.  These replacement blades made it like new again. It took less than a minute to swap them out.</li>
            <li> It was better than I thought it would be, buzzed my head right down to the skin ( comfortably )</li>
            <li> does not cute, pinches, does not work right withe the clippers.  I feel as I got ripped off for the first time</li>
            <li> When I found out my Wahl color pro blades got dull, and need of sharpening it didn&#x27;t work. So I decided to go &amp;#34;what the heck, so be it&amp;#34; ordered these 5 star Wahl balding blades and it works like magic. But be very careful they are sharp as described.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit, don&#x27;t buy a whole new razor just these. Super sharp, adjust it all the way back and you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Thanx I was looking for this item for months and I&#x27;m glad you had it in stock...looking forward to doing business with you again</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t listen to the others. They know nothing. Only Republicans would like another blade. Maybe they only like white blades or blades with male parts.</li>
            <li> I should have got these earlier, clippers are good as new again gives a clean cut and they weren&#x27;t to bad to adjust when they were installed</li>
            <li> It works great! I noticed that when I used my clippers it started to pull and I knew it could have been one of two issues, misaligned blade or worn out. I knew they were worn out because my neighbor who is a barber checked the blades and they were lined up properly. Now my clippers work like new!</li>
            <li> As described and works perfectly, replacing one I had with damaged teeth.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and packaged great.  I love these clippers for a close shave.  Would have like better installation instructions, but I figured it out ok.</li>
            <li> This purchase has been one of the best purchases that I have made this year.  The package was easy to open and they were easy to install.</li>
            <li> I bought the wahl 5 star balding clipper and it pulled skin , i tried many methods of fixing it but nothing worked, so i bought these new blades and it works perfect now</li>
            <li> No problems installing and the cut was great.  I dropped my clippers and the blade was actually cutting me.  I was going to buy new clippers but I was happy to find these online.  I would definitely recommend these blades as replacements if you have the Wahl Balding Clippers.</li>
            <li> How do you beat the best blades</li>
            <li> Super sharp compared to the ones I replaced.&lt;br /&gt;FIt great.</li>
            <li> Im a professional hairstylist and was a little worried about the blades being legit.  but as soon as i recieved them and put them on making sure they were balanced.  And they cut like a hot knife thru butter.  Im very greatful for the price, which is better than my pro discount in local beauty supply stores. But also I got them in 2 business days which was fabulous.  Thanks for the great product</li>
            <li> The package came sooner than they said it would and was exactly what I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades fit the razor perfectly and cut better than the worn ones I replaced with them.</li>
