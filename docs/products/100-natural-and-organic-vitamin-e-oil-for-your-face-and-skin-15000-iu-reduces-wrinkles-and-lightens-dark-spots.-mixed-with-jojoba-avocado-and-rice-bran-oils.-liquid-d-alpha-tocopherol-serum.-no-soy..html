            <li>my face is more smooth.  </li>
            <li>The oil arrived quickly and is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>im a pretty satisfied customer!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use &amp; is not sticky or tackie like some products.</li>
            <li>It comes out of the dropper easily</li>

            <li>you want a natural skin product where you can feel safe knowing every ingredient, this is really a good oil to try -- I recommend it</li>
            <li>I would love to see what special products they have for your eyes.</li>
            <li>Appears to be helping skin tone and fine lines.</li>
            <li>My skin looked firmer and fine lines &amp;#34;seemed to disappear&amp;#34; after 2-3 days.</li>
            <li>My fine lines are diminished as well.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly too!</li>

            <li>We have been using this product for about 2 months and it is making a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>Huge plus.</li>
            <li>it leaves my skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li>It goes on your skin so smooth and not sticky.</li>
            <li>stunning product and worth every penny</li>
            <li>This oil has more density than I am used to but it is absorbed in the skin quite rapidly.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine had only great things to say, which had already turned 40, and said if there was anything to add to my regimen</li>
            <li>and now I know why, because the others use cheap Vitamin E</li>
            <li>the good thing is, is that I have not had even one pimple and my face is extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>and it also helps that the sellers are very customer friendly, after I ordered they even called to make sure that everything was okay.....</li>
            <li>Thanks for making something clean and natural I can trust on my face to deliver incredible results.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and clear, and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>My laugh lines are gone, and this oil has done a continuously wonderful job of keeping the skin flaking properties of the Retin-A gel down to a minimum.</li>
            <li>Goes on nicely, doesn&#x27;t take too much to absorb quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed significant results since using this product.</li>
            <li>to top it off it has a really soothing scent!  </li>
            <li>The company even called us personally to make sure we were satisfied with the product!  </li>
            <li>In about three weeks, I have seen a significant improvement in my combination-type skin.</li>
            <li>Well worth it!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to read the list of ingredients in this product.</li>
            <li>It has a unique lavender odor to it that is quite soothing.  </li>
            <li>first time user of vitamin e oil, i love it.</li>
            <li>I have used it now for about two weeks consistently and am already seeing great results in the general health and tone of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I was amazed at how easily my skin absorbed it.</li>
            <li>Great product - after just a few days of using it on my face, my complexion looked better and skin smoother.  </li>
            <li>I love this oil, dark sports are almost gone , amazing !</li>
            <li>It softened the fine lines around my eyes and didn&#x27;t make my eyes burn as I have experienced with a lot of other under eye moisturizing products.</li>
            <li>love that it&#x27;s easy to apply and gets absorbed very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I put this on twice a day and makes my skin nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff, very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Upon submitting my review, the company gave me a full refund.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty dense in consistency and rich in color with a light herbal scent that doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the real deal and real Vitamin E is just better for you!</li>
            <li>My main concern was that adding more oil to my already oily skin would cause acne flare-ups, but that didn&#x27;t happen at all.</li>
            <li>I was given a bottle of this to try and I went through it so quickly.</li>
            <li>This seems to absorb quickly, and has sped up the healing on some damaged skin.  </li>
            <li>Years ago I used vitamin E oil on my belly when pregnant and NEVER got stretch marks.</li>
            <li>and luckily I didn&#x27;t breakout</li>
            <li>So far it has eased my fine lines!</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s all natural and no chemicals.</li>
            <li>They should consider making one for people that are more sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s all natural Vitamin E and</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the price</li>
            <li>Totally worth it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I finally found something natural and healthy and that goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>A bit pricey but worth it for the benefit to my skin.</li>
            <li>Soaks right in though.  </li>
            <li>it works right away.</li>
            <li>I use ir right after a shower to prevent my face from trying to produce excess oil.</li>
            <li>first time user of vitamin e oil, takes a few uses to get used to, my skin feels great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty penny but worth it.</li>
            <li>Thank you for the pure ingredients!</li>
            <li>I recently read that the natural form works twice as good as the synthetic</li>
            <li>Product is great, I currently have mine mixed with  organic Shea butter</li>
            <li>Consistency is good, not too thick, goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>A fantastic all natural moisturizer and anti-aging serum for my skin!</li>
            <li>you very much.</li>
            <li>I bought this product and after two weeks, this product had smoothed out my fine lines under my eyes brought on by two young kids, sun, and age.</li>
            <li>I cannot recommend this any higher.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s completely absorbed when I&#x27;m ready to do my makeup.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more of this</li>
            <li>So glad I finally figured out the difference and that I found this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>It really does work!</li>
            <li>and my skin just looks SOOOOO much healthier!</li>
            <li>I have since been using the oil on my entire face and love it.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>At first I was hestitant to use an oil on my face.</li>
            <li>I just did and I love the way it feels on my skin, it absorbs quickly (I have very dry skin).</li>
            <li>Otherwise it goes on slick and easy and after 30 to 40 minutes most of it is absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping, Quality product, I highly recommend</li>
            <li>I had given up hope of not having to wear foundation to hold my head up in public, but this dream is becoming a reality.</li>
            <li>It soaks in nicely and I enjoy the subtle lavender fragrance.</li>
            <li>It penetrates the skin fairly quickly, leaving it feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of like your face gets sanded and it reduces the depth of wrinkles, makes them less noticeable.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a pure, organic Vitamin E oil with NO soybean oil.  </li>
            <li>A pure grade.  </li>
            <li>that I&#x27;m a lot older than that!</li>
            <li>Very high quality oil.  </li>
            <li>It soaks right in to your skin leaving it very soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>Ships fast.</li>
            <li>i am very please this product.thank</li>
            <li>Much appreciated and</li>
            <li>I have VERY oily skin and thought this would be really oily</li>
            <li>, my skin is very oily and this too is oily when I put it on or it may be the Shea butter that&#x27;s oily</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Plus, since ordering the product, I&#x27;ve learned about the company, and I really like them.</li>
            <li>so much so that I decided to leave a review.  </li>
            <li>I bought this oil primarily because I recently had to have surgery.  </li>
            <li>I have not been&lt;br /&gt;disappointed and absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I find very soothing.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t want to use up this bottle too fast.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft, smooth and looks clear.  </li>
            <li>Not a major shift in your routine to get such amazing results.</li>
            <li>so he had some pretty rough scars but he has been using this oil 3 times a day for 2 months and the scars have lightened tremendously!</li>
            <li>I like the fact that they used other healthy oils with the vitamin e.</li>
            <li>I wish it came in a little bigger size though because I&#x27;ve heard vitamin E is good for your hair</li>
            <li>Your face glows and looks youthful and vibrant.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product and this company.</li>
            <li>Plus, it smells good, it glides on smooth, and the small drops go a long way, unlike vitamin e from by-mouth vitamin capsules you have to break open to apply.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more soft and silky feeling than other Vitamin E creams I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a very high quality, natural Vitamin&lt;</li>
            <li>Gentle on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with my Vitamin E oil; I received it a few weeks ago but did not have the chance to try it.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy, and it helps with lines, especially the smile lines around the eyes.</li>
            <li>When I use it, my face feels so soft and the dark areas under my eyes are even getting better.</li>
            <li>Not hard to put on, but noticeable.  </li>
            <li>and I no longer have dry spots and my face is smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I struggled a lot of years with acne until I stopped using all of those store products that had many hidden chemicals and went to a product that is all natural.</li>
            <li>The oil is fine, not thick and has a few other essential oils to it that works and smells nice.</li>
            <li>For the past years the only products that didn&#x27;t cause my acne to flair up was using dove sensitive skin bar soap to wash my face and then using aveeno&#x27;s face moisturizer and this worked perfectly, but I feel as though the aveeno has not been making my dark marks disappear as it once did</li>
            <li>It has helped heal my acne scars while helping to prevent new breakouts.  </li>
            <li>The only issue I have with it is cost and that since I use it so much I can see it going fast.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and I have eczema.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t get past the overwhelming smell of the lavender/palmarosa oil.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want any chemicals in the products and I prefer it to be made in the USA - and if by a small boutique shop that makes their products by hand all the better.  </li>
            <li>and when I saw they came out with a new all natural vitamin e oil, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li>So far, this is the only face oil that I&#x27;ve tried that really hydrates my skin &amp; doesn&#x27;t break me out!</li>
            <li>I really like the way it absorbs into my skin and leaves my face feeling soft with no dry areas.  </li>
            <li>I wanted this to diminish the look of a large scar from a recent surgery</li>
            <li>It works well with my sensitive skin, and</li>
            <li>so I decided to try a natural oil this time.  </li>
            <li>I bought 100% Natural and Organic Vitamin E Oil specifically to use with Retin-A 1% gel.</li>
            <li>Regardless, I&#x27;m rather sensitive to scents</li>
            <li>I was religiously washing my face, exfoliating, moisturizing, the whole nine yards without any results.  </li>
            <li>and so far I do not have any complaints</li>
            <li>I care about how I look and don&#x27;t want to look too old too soon.</li>
            <li>If you are a woman of color looking for a natural moisturizer to help eliminate acne scars, this product is for you.</li>
            <li>I put it on at night and in the morning, my skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li>still to early to tell if it&#x27;s making a difference in my&lt;br /&gt; skin appearance, but so far, I&#x27;m going to continue using&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also use it as an aftershave which has completely stopped the redness I get after shaving.</li>
            <li>It has to be the natural, instead of</li>
            <li>At first it was a little hard to apply it, but soon I found out that if I apply it on my wet face the oil goes more smoothly on my face.</li>
            <li>I love it and its only been a few days!</li>
            <li>My rating, obviously, shows the degree of satisfaction with the oil &amp; high recommendation with both the oil &amp; the company.</li>
            <li>I have found other natural organic vitamin e oils available through amazon that don&#x27;t have that slippery oily feeling left on your skin that doesn&#x27;t last all day but keeps skin moisturized.</li>
            <li>I occasionally mix this with pure coconut oil to use as a facial moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>so I decided to try something new, which is this vitamin E mixed with Shea butter</li>
            <li>This organic oil is very soothing on dry skin.</li>
            <li>And you only need 3 drops to deeply hydrate your whole face.</li>
            <li>Being the price seems much for the size it is, you&#x27;re only applying 3 drops on your face with your regular face cream in the morning and night.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about this product is the quality of it, I can tell apart from other drugstore brand that this is the real deal, try it &amp; you don&#x27;t be disappointed :)</li>
            <li>I replaced my moisturizer with this product; it has been essential in my search for clear skin!</li>
            <li>and I have notice a major difference in the tone of my skin...</li>
            <li>I mixed it in with my moisturizer because my skin was very dry at first, but still don&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think there would be such a difference between the natural (d-alpha tocopheryl) and the synthetic (dL-alpha tocopheryl</li>
            <li>it is completely organic and the body only relates to that which is organic as the body is made from organic dirt.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product after using an entire bottle of Jason&#x27;s and deciding I wanted a natural, organic product instead.</li>
            <li>I constantly get compliments on my complexion and even my adult jaw-line acne has all but vanished after using this product along with a reduction of lines around my lips and eyes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually spend above $20 for ANYTHING, but 100% Natural and Organic Vitamin E Oil from Health Priority Natural Products has been worth it for me.</li>
            <li>Our daughter had open heart surgery at 2.5 months old.  </li>
            <li>This is my 2nd week using this product on my face and so far I&#x27;m liking what I see.</li>
            <li>This product only had organic, natural ingredients in it.</li>
            <li>Finally found something natural    </li>
            <li>It only has organic and all natural ingredients in it</li>
            <li>I will definitely keep this on my frequent order list.</li>
            <li>I have used another similar product on Amazon, but after trying the Health Priority Natural Products Vitamin E Oil, I&#x27;m not going back to the old one.  </li>
            <li>To me, it&#x27;s worth the little extra money.</li>
            <li>I saw other Vitamin E oils selling for a lot less but that made me wonder why the others were so cheap -</li>
            <li>All I know is that the natural vitamin e must be the right thing for whatever skin type I have because after just a few short weeks, I can see a difference in some of the wrinkles I&#x27;ve have for the last several years.</li>
            <li>, I haven&#x27;t really noticed my dark spots lightening up yet</li>
            <li>I started to use less than the recommended amount of drops because my face was very oil.</li>
            <li>Plus all natural, no chemicals which was probably the reason for the dry spots.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It soaks into your skin really fabulously, and does not cause break-outs!</li>
            <li> I was rather oily when I went to bed, but I woke up with the smoothest, most supple skin.  </li>
            <li> but my skin has never looked or felt better.  </li>
            <li> I love that it is organic also.</li>
            <li> I will keep buying this and plan to purchase more for my mom and sisters as gifts.</li>
            <li> I love, love, lobe this vitamin e oil.</li>
            <li> but though it takes about 5 minutes it absorbs better in my skin...</li>

            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>

            <li> The oil arrived quickly and is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> im a pretty satisfied customer!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use &amp; is not sticky or tackie like some products.</li>
            <li> It comes out of the dropper easily</li>

            <li> you want a natural skin product where you can feel safe knowing every ingredient, this is really a good oil to try -- I recommend it</li>
            <li> I would love to see what special products they have for your eyes.</li>
            <li> Appears to be helping skin tone and fine lines.</li>
            <li> My skin looked firmer and fine lines &amp;#34;seemed to disappear&amp;#34; after 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> My fine lines are diminished as well.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also pleased with the company&#x27;s quick delivery of their product.  </li>
            <li> I am enjoying this product very much so!  </li>
            <li> Love this product, thanks!!</li>
            <li> We have been using this product for about 2 months and it is making a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> Huge plus.</li>
            <li> it leaves my skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li> It goes on your skin so smooth and not sticky.</li>
            <li> stunning product and worth every penny</li>
            <li> This oil has more density than I am used to but it is absorbed in the skin quite rapidly.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine had only great things to say, which had already turned 40, and said if there was anything to add to my regimen</li>
            <li> and now I know why, because the others use cheap Vitamin E</li>
            <li> the good thing is, is that I have not had even one pimple and my face is extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li> So far so good</li>
            <li> and it also helps that the sellers are very customer friendly, after I ordered they even called to make sure that everything was okay.....</li>
            <li> Thanks for making something clean and natural I can trust on my face to deliver incredible results.</li>
            <li> Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and clear, and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> My laugh lines are gone, and this oil has done a continuously wonderful job of keeping the skin flaking properties of the Retin-A gel down to a minimum.</li>
            <li> Goes on nicely, doesn&#x27;t take too much to absorb quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed significant results since using this product.</li>
            <li> to top it off it has a really soothing scent!  </li>
            <li> The company even called us personally to make sure we were satisfied with the product!  </li>
            <li> In about three weeks, I have seen a significant improvement in my combination-type skin.</li>
            <li> Well worth it!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to read the list of ingredients in this product.</li>
            <li> It has a unique lavender odor to it that is quite soothing.  </li>
            <li> first time user of vitamin e oil, i love it.</li>
            <li> I have used it now for about two weeks consistently and am already seeing great results in the general health and tone of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed at how easily my skin absorbed it.</li>
            <li> Great product - after just a few days of using it on my face, my complexion looked better and skin smoother.  </li>
            <li> I love this oil, dark sports are almost gone , amazing !</li>
            <li> It softened the fine lines around my eyes and didn&#x27;t make my eyes burn as I have experienced with a lot of other under eye moisturizing products.</li>
            <li> love that it&#x27;s easy to apply and gets absorbed very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I put this on twice a day and makes my skin nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff, very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Upon submitting my review, the company gave me a full refund.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty dense in consistency and rich in color with a light herbal scent that doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the real deal and real Vitamin E is just better for you!</li>
            <li> My main concern was that adding more oil to my already oily skin would cause acne flare-ups, but that didn&#x27;t happen at all.</li>
            <li> I was given a bottle of this to try and I went through it so quickly.</li>
            <li> This seems to absorb quickly, and has sped up the healing on some damaged skin.  </li>
            <li> Years ago I used vitamin E oil on my belly when pregnant and NEVER got stretch marks.</li>
            <li> and luckily I didn&#x27;t breakout</li>
            <li> So far it has eased my fine lines!</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s all natural and no chemicals.</li>
            <li> They should consider making one for people that are more sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s all natural Vitamin E and</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the price</li>
            <li> Totally worth it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I finally found something natural and healthy and that goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey but worth it for the benefit to my skin.</li>
            <li> Soaks right in though.  </li>
            <li> it works right away.</li>
            <li> I use ir right after a shower to prevent my face from trying to produce excess oil.</li>
            <li> first time user of vitamin e oil, takes a few uses to get used to, my skin feels great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty penny but worth it.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the pure ingredients!</li>
            <li> I recently read that the natural form works twice as good as the synthetic</li>
            <li> Product is great, I currently have mine mixed with  organic Shea butter</li>
            <li> Consistency is good, not too thick, goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> A fantastic all natural moisturizer and anti-aging serum for my skin!</li>
            <li> you very much.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and after two weeks, this product had smoothed out my fine lines under my eyes brought on by two young kids, sun, and age.</li>
            <li> I cannot recommend this any higher.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s completely absorbed when I&#x27;m ready to do my makeup.</li>
            <li> I will definitely order more of this</li>
            <li> So glad I finally figured out the difference and that I found this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> It really does work!</li>
            <li> and my skin just looks SOOOOO much healthier!</li>
            <li> I have since been using the oil on my entire face and love it.  </li>
            <li> It is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> At first I was hestitant to use an oil on my face.</li>
            <li> I just did and I love the way it feels on my skin, it absorbs quickly (I have very dry skin).</li>
            <li> Otherwise it goes on slick and easy and after 30 to 40 minutes most of it is absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, Quality product, I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I had given up hope of not having to wear foundation to hold my head up in public, but this dream is becoming a reality.</li>
            <li> It soaks in nicely and I enjoy the subtle lavender fragrance.</li>
            <li> It penetrates the skin fairly quickly, leaving it feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of like your face gets sanded and it reduces the depth of wrinkles, makes them less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a pure, organic Vitamin E oil with NO soybean oil.  </li>
            <li> A pure grade.  </li>
            <li> that I&#x27;m a lot older than that!</li>
            <li> Very high quality oil.  </li>
            <li> It soaks right in to your skin leaving it very soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Ships fast.</li>
            <li> i am very please this product.thank</li>
            <li> Much appreciated and</li>
            <li> I have VERY oily skin and thought this would be really oily</li>
            <li> , my skin is very oily and this too is oily when I put it on or it may be the Shea butter that&#x27;s oily</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Plus, since ordering the product, I&#x27;ve learned about the company, and I really like them.</li>
            <li> so much so that I decided to leave a review.  </li>
            <li> I bought this oil primarily because I recently had to have surgery.  </li>
            <li> I have not been&lt;br /&gt;disappointed and absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I find very soothing.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t want to use up this bottle too fast.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft, smooth and looks clear.  </li>
            <li> Not a major shift in your routine to get such amazing results.</li>
            <li> so he had some pretty rough scars but he has been using this oil 3 times a day for 2 months and the scars have lightened tremendously!</li>
            <li> I like the fact that they used other healthy oils with the vitamin e.</li>
            <li> I wish it came in a little bigger size though because I&#x27;ve heard vitamin E is good for your hair</li>
            <li> Your face glows and looks youthful and vibrant.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product and this company.</li>
            <li> Plus, it smells good, it glides on smooth, and the small drops go a long way, unlike vitamin e from by-mouth vitamin capsules you have to break open to apply.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more soft and silky feeling than other Vitamin E creams I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a very high quality, natural Vitamin&lt;</li>
            <li> Gentle on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my Vitamin E oil; I received it a few weeks ago but did not have the chance to try it.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy, and it helps with lines, especially the smile lines around the eyes.</li>
            <li> When I use it, my face feels so soft and the dark areas under my eyes are even getting better.</li>
            <li> Not hard to put on, but noticeable.  </li>
            <li> and I no longer have dry spots and my face is smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I struggled a lot of years with acne until I stopped using all of those store products that had many hidden chemicals and went to a product that is all natural.</li>
            <li> The oil is fine, not thick and has a few other essential oils to it that works and smells nice.</li>
            <li> For the past years the only products that didn&#x27;t cause my acne to flair up was using dove sensitive skin bar soap to wash my face and then using aveeno&#x27;s face moisturizer and this worked perfectly, but I feel as though the aveeno has not been making my dark marks disappear as it once did</li>
            <li> It has helped heal my acne scars while helping to prevent new breakouts.  </li>
            <li> The only issue I have with it is cost and that since I use it so much I can see it going fast.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and I have eczema.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t get past the overwhelming smell of the lavender/palmarosa oil.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want any chemicals in the products and I prefer it to be made in the USA - and if by a small boutique shop that makes their products by hand all the better.  </li>
            <li> and when I saw they came out with a new all natural vitamin e oil, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li> So far, this is the only face oil that I&#x27;ve tried that really hydrates my skin &amp; doesn&#x27;t break me out!</li>
            <li> I really like the way it absorbs into my skin and leaves my face feeling soft with no dry areas.  </li>
            <li> I wanted this to diminish the look of a large scar from a recent surgery</li>
            <li> It works well with my sensitive skin, and</li>
            <li> so I decided to try a natural oil this time.  </li>
            <li> I bought 100% Natural and Organic Vitamin E Oil specifically to use with Retin-A 1% gel.</li>
            <li> Regardless, I&#x27;m rather sensitive to scents</li>
            <li> I was religiously washing my face, exfoliating, moisturizing, the whole nine yards without any results.  </li>
            <li> and so far I do not have any complaints</li>
            <li> I care about how I look and don&#x27;t want to look too old too soon.</li>
            <li> If you are a woman of color looking for a natural moisturizer to help eliminate acne scars, this product is for you.</li>
            <li> I put it on at night and in the morning, my skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li> still to early to tell if it&#x27;s making a difference in my&lt;br /&gt; skin appearance, but so far, I&#x27;m going to continue using&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also use it as an aftershave which has completely stopped the redness I get after shaving.</li>
            <li> It has to be the natural, instead of</li>
            <li> At first it was a little hard to apply it, but soon I found out that if I apply it on my wet face the oil goes more smoothly on my face.</li>
            <li> I love it and its only been a few days!</li>
            <li> My rating, obviously, shows the degree of satisfaction with the oil &amp; high recommendation with both the oil &amp; the company.</li>
            <li> I have found other natural organic vitamin e oils available through amazon that don&#x27;t have that slippery oily feeling left on your skin that doesn&#x27;t last all day but keeps skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> I occasionally mix this with pure coconut oil to use as a facial moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> so I decided to try something new, which is this vitamin E mixed with Shea butter</li>
            <li> This organic oil is very soothing on dry skin.</li>
            <li> And you only need 3 drops to deeply hydrate your whole face.</li>
            <li> Being the price seems much for the size it is, you&#x27;re only applying 3 drops on your face with your regular face cream in the morning and night.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this product is the quality of it, I can tell apart from other drugstore brand that this is the real deal, try it &amp; you don&#x27;t be disappointed :)</li>
            <li> I replaced my moisturizer with this product; it has been essential in my search for clear skin!</li>
            <li> and I have notice a major difference in the tone of my skin...</li>
            <li> I mixed it in with my moisturizer because my skin was very dry at first, but still don&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think there would be such a difference between the natural (d-alpha tocopheryl) and the synthetic (dL-alpha tocopheryl</li>
            <li> it is completely organic and the body only relates to that which is organic as the body is made from organic dirt.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after using an entire bottle of Jason&#x27;s and deciding I wanted a natural, organic product instead.</li>
            <li> I constantly get compliments on my complexion and even my adult jaw-line acne has all but vanished after using this product along with a reduction of lines around my lips and eyes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually spend above $20 for ANYTHING, but 100% Natural and Organic Vitamin E Oil from Health Priority Natural Products has been worth it for me.</li>
            <li> Our daughter had open heart surgery at 2.5 months old.  </li>
            <li> This is my 2nd week using this product on my face and so far I&#x27;m liking what I see.</li>
            <li> This product only had organic, natural ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> Finally found something natural    </li>
            <li> It only has organic and all natural ingredients in it</li>
            <li> I will definitely keep this on my frequent order list.</li>
            <li> I have used another similar product on Amazon, but after trying the Health Priority Natural Products Vitamin E Oil, I&#x27;m not going back to the old one.  </li>
            <li> To me, it&#x27;s worth the little extra money.</li>
            <li> I saw other Vitamin E oils selling for a lot less but that made me wonder why the others were so cheap -</li>
            <li> All I know is that the natural vitamin e must be the right thing for whatever skin type I have because after just a few short weeks, I can see a difference in some of the wrinkles I&#x27;ve have for the last several years.</li>
            <li> , I haven&#x27;t really noticed my dark spots lightening up yet</li>
            <li> I started to use less than the recommended amount of drops because my face was very oil.</li>
            <li> Plus all natural, no chemicals which was probably the reason for the dry spots.</li>
            <li> , I will start using this along with other natural oils for my eyelashes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a raw foodist who really cares about what I put in and on my body.</li>
            <li> During a recent facial I was advised to get vitamin e capsules and poke a hole to apply the oil to the dry patches on my face.  </li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to see.</li>
            <li> This product lasts a long time because I only use a couple of drops in each area.</li>
            <li> and it looks like the bottle is going to last me a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have regular to dry skin &amp; I appy</li>
            <li> I bought it initially for my dry skin, scars and blemishes, but then started using it in concoctions for cellulite wraps and stretch mark</li>
            <li> but before I found this product, all I could find was the synthetic version or the pure version that was to thick.</li>
            <li> this review is long overdue.</li>
            <li> Just one drop goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This stuff really can be used for anything I use it for dark circles under my eyes along with coconut oil and the dark circles are almost gone!!</li>
            <li> I sometimes get dry skin, so I have tried it out on my face, neck and chest before bedtime.  </li>
            <li> You should have seen the smile on my face the other day when somebody thought I was in my late 20s!  </li>
            <li> This Vitamin E oil is all natural with very few ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I have acne scar hyper-pigmentation and both oily and dry skin (depending on a wide number of factors).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been about a week and a half</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to turn 40 in a few months and have been seeing some apparent signs of wrinkles... as expected.</li>
            <li> We also rub it on her cheeks to cure the Extreme chapped dry skin she got from the hospital.  </li>
            <li> I apply a few drops of the oil on my entire face at night (instead of my night cream)</li>
            <li> Carefully packages for delivery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very greasy, and has a&lt;br /&gt;wonderful fragrance.</li>
            <li> its really not for oil skin at all..</li>
            <li> My skin appears to be less dry.</li>
            <li> Less dry.</li>
            <li> This little bottle goes a long way too.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so despite it being in such a small bottle, it lasts a while.</li>
            <li> I use this to treat any scars I have and mix it with my other body care products.</li>
            <li> Other vitamin e products I had tried made my face break out, but not this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried some of the other products here on Amazon&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> the other companies try to sell.</li>
            <li> I have used other oils and they seem to sit there...</li>
            <li> At first, I thought this stuff was kinda expensive.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s not real oil and they mix the Vitamin E in a cheap oil like soybean oil (which I&#x27;ve also heard is bad for you).</li>
            <li> By adding a few drops to my leave-in hair conditioner, my dry hair behaves as it should.</li>
            <li> After a lengthy stint of bad skin--acne, flaky, fine</li>
            <li> and I can see my dark spots getting lighter and lighter.</li>
            <li> my shin glows like a worm in the dark.</li>
            <li> and it has lighted up my dark spots</li>
            <li> Also it seems to reduce some of the dark spots.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks and have seen some improvement in my dark spots</li>
            <li> I will buy this product and other products from them again!</li>
            <li> I then apply another small dap to the dry spots in the morning before applying my make up.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;not wasted my money on all that other stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed improved skin tone, tightened skin and less lines and puffiness.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks, once a day in the morning, and I already see improvements in my skin texture, and tone,and I got less brakeouts.</li>
            <li> Feel like it clogged my pores, I did see some slight improvements</li>
            <li> Almost a year and a half later...we still use it on our daughters chest scars.  </li>
            <li> My forehead wrinkles are getting less noticeable and I even put it on some of my post-pregnancy stretch marks</li>
            <li> It says not too thick, but I was surprised by how thick it is.  </li>
            <li> However I found that my make up used to clump a little after using it in the mornings</li>
            <li> Some of them have worked a little bit but never anything to write home about.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already noticed my dark spots are fading!</li>
            <li> where as when i cleaned my face then dried it, i used this vitamin E oil and it makes my skin not feel sticky</li>
            <li> The big companies always put chemicals and other bad ingredients in beauty products and I try to stay away from all those chemicals as much as possible.</li>
            <li> Problems of hair breakage and pesky split ends are in the past.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have an excessive amount of shine.....</li>
            <li> My dad and I have been using it for the past couple of months and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others in the past</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s and have had some wrinkle problems for a few years now.</li>
            <li> all of them have been too sticky and hard to get out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> be they&#x27;ve been too hard to use</li>
            <li> Under eye lines are disappearing and some blemishes I&#x27;ve had for years are slowly fading away.</li>
            <li> (In warmer weather, just a dab will do, and for dry skin from cold weather, you can use it generously.)</li>
            <li> I am a serious believer in this oil.  </li>
            <li> The scar is so faint.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of skincare products in the past and I&#x27;m usually disappointed.</li>
            <li> I want it to heal without leaving such a nasty scar.  </li>
            <li> I was desperate to figure out something to heal it.  </li>
            <li> it truly a life changer, my dad was in a bad truck accident and had to get surgery done on his face</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> My acne became worst..:</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product! Love how it makes my skin feel and look</li>
            <li> I cannot recommend this any higher. This stuff is fabulous! I&#x27;ve noticed significant results since using this product. I use it on my face and neck. I&#x27;ve noticed improved skin tone, tightened skin and less lines and puffiness.  I occasionally mix this with pure coconut oil to use as a facial moisturizer.  Love it.  This little bottle goes a long way too.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  Will never use anything else but this product on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product three times now. Ships fast. Very friendly and informative seller. I Love this oil, I put it on as soon as I get out of the shower and it&#x27;s completely absorbed when I&#x27;m ready to do my makeup. I enjoy the scent and light feel and most importantly the results! I&#x27;ve been recommending it to friends as well as family.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my Vitamin E oil; I received it&lt;br /&gt;only yesterday and have used it twice. I love the way&lt;br /&gt;it feels on my skin, it&#x27;s not greasy, It absorbs quickly,&lt;br /&gt;and it leaves my skin silky smooth. Delivery was prompt;&lt;br /&gt;I also received an e-mail informing me about the product&lt;br /&gt;and how to use it. I will definitely order more of this&lt;br /&gt;product in the future.</li>
            <li> i am very please this product.thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this product very much so!  It works well with my sensitive skin, and to top it off it has a really soothing scent!  A little goes a long way, so despite it being in such a small bottle, it lasts a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest...I didn&#x27;t think there would be such a difference between the natural (d-alpha tocopheryl) and the synthetic (dL-alpha tocopheryl) versions of Vitamin E...but there is!  I recently read that the natural form works twice as good as the synthetic so I decided to try a natural oil this time.  Now, I&#x27;ll never use the synthetic kind again!  I&#x27;ve been using this Vitamin E for several weeks now and I can see my dark spots getting lighter and lighter. It&#x27;s also working wonders on my crows feet. So glad I finally figured out the difference and that I found this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself some time and money and ditch the synthetic stuff :-)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good. I like it. I can see the difference even after two times only. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this......it smells great with the lavender oil in it, and I love that every ingredient is organic!  It says not too thick, but I was surprised by how thick it is.  Not hard to put on, but noticeable.  Soaks right in though.  I received this product in exchange for my unbiased review</li>
            <li> i used this product even on my scalp and in 1 month i noticed even my hair is growing like 4th of july fire works. my shin glows like a worm in the dark. you must have this product in your home. it is completely organic and the body only relates to that which is organic as the body is made from organic dirt.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after using an entire bottle of Jason&#x27;s and deciding I wanted a natural, organic product instead. I have been utterly wowed by the results. I do not wear makeup to work therefore I apply the product morning and night after my lotion. I constantly get compliments on my complexion and even my adult jaw-line acne has all but vanished after using this product along with a reduction of lines around my lips and eyes. I have been so impressed with the results, I&#x27;ll be keeping this product in stock in my medicine cabinet. Thanks for making something clean and natural I can trust on my face to deliver incredible results.</li>
            <li> This has a beautiful scent,&lt;br /&gt;I will be adding this to my homemade skin care products</li>
            <li> Love it. I&#x27;m placing an order for more.</li>
            <li> I love how my skin looks and feels after applying it. Your face glows and looks youthful and vibrant. Definitely a keeper!</li>
            <li> It really does work! And it workers at. The smell also is very pleasant. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I was looking for a pure, organic Vitamin E oil with NO soybean oil.  This Vitamin E oil is all natural with very few ingredients.  And what is in the bottle is all good!  I wanted this to diminish the look of a large scar from a recent surgery and I actually noticed a difference after using it just once.  Highly recommend this product and this company.</li>
            <li> I love this serum.  I have used it now for about two weeks consistently and am already seeing great results in the general health and tone of my skin.  I will be ordering more when I am done with this bottle.  A fantastic all natural moisturizer and anti-aging serum for my skin!</li>
            <li> This oil is a wonderful addition to my winter skincare routine! It&#x27;s pretty dense in consistency and rich in color with a light herbal scent that doesn&#x27;t linger. It seems like it would be greasy but it isn&#x27;t! after application, I allow it to absorb for about 5 minutes and follow it up with either an SPF in the morning or a night cream and it works amazingly well! No breakouts, irritation or redness, will consider purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my Vitamin E oil; I received it a few weeks ago but did not have the chance to try it. I just did and I love the way it feels on my skin, it absorbs quickly (I have very dry skin). This oil smells great and I love that the ingredients are organic! I just ordered another one!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Health Priority Natural Products for a great product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very rich oil and the customer service has been amazing. I&#x27;ve been away on a trip but the sellers did their best contacting me multiple times to get my feedback. Much appreciated and this review is long overdue. I use this to treat any scars I have and mix it with my other body care products. I also loved the thank you email with my purchase and the cute dog picture in it.</li>
            <li> first time user of vitamin e oil, takes a few uses to get used to, my skin feels great</li>
            <li> I have acne scar hyper-pigmentation and both oily and dry skin (depending on a wide number of factors). I bought 100% Natural and Organic Vitamin E Oil specifically to use with Retin-A 1% gel. It&#x27;s only been about a week and a half and my skin just looks SOOOOO much healthier! My laugh lines are gone, and this oil has done a continuously wonderful job of keeping the skin flaking properties of the Retin-A gel down to a minimum. My main concern was that adding more oil to my already oily skin would cause acne flare-ups, but that didn&#x27;t happen at all. I had given up hope of not having to wear foundation to hold my head up in public, but this dream is becoming a reality. I don&#x27;t usually spend above $20 for ANYTHING, but 100% Natural and Organic Vitamin E Oil from Health Priority Natural Products has been worth it for me. Plus, it smells good, it glides on smooth, and the small drops go a long way, unlike vitamin e from by-mouth vitamin capsules you have to break open to apply.</li>
            <li> I love it! it works right away. my sking felt smooth and healthy:) I will order more</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! And you only need 3 drops to deeply hydrate your whole face. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks, once a day in the morning, and I already see improvements in my skin texture, and tone,and I got less brakeouts.</li>
            <li> I am not for sure if this is organic but I have been using it for a week and it has lighted up my dark spots my face is more smooth.  I have VERY oily skin and thought this would be really oily but it is not.  I think my skin needed this oil to maintain a healthy glow.  I have acne on my cheeks and believe it or not it is helping with my acne as well.  It&#x27;s a pretty penny but worth it.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this project.  Shipped on time and seems to be helping with the smaller wrinkles.</li>
            <li> so far so good, love it!</li>
            <li> It softened the fine lines around my eyes and didn&#x27;t make my eyes burn as I have experienced with a lot of other under eye moisturizing products.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and I have eczema. This oil is wonderful on my skin. I absolutely love it. Love that it&#x27;s all natural and no chemicals.</li>
            <li> best quality, worth the money and the customer service&lt;br /&gt;was top notch</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. I like how my face feels after using it. The product was delivered on time and in great condition. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use this in my scar reduction recipe and just love it!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. I was amazed at how easily my skin absorbed it. I will purchase this product again and again!</li>
            <li> I love the stuff! I was given a bottle of this to try and I went through it so quickly. A little goes a long way but I was using it elbows my feet my knuckles my scars and all those items of my husband sister mother and niece lol. I love it! I&#x27;m so glad I was given an opportunity to review this. Otherwise I might not have even come across this wonderful autumn. Try it! As soon as it&#x27;s in the budget you better believe I&#x27;m buying it again!</li>
            <li> This vitamin E oil works well but I can&#x27;t get past the overwhelming smell of the lavender/palmarosa oil. I have had lotion with lavender oil and the smell didn&#x27;t bother me so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s just the lavender oil. I have never smelled palmarosa oil so maybe it&#x27;s that. Regardless, I&#x27;m rather sensitive to scents so maybe it wouldn&#x27;t bother anyone else. They should consider making one for people that are more sensitive to smells. The sharpness in the scent makes it so I can&#x27;t use it. But the product itself is good.</li>
            <li> Great Product and very quickly shipped! Thank you.</li>
            <li> Goes on nicely, doesn&#x27;t take too much to absorb quickly.  Has a pleasant fragrance.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> The oil was given to me by my sister as a gift. I started using it twice a day and saw an improvement in the texture of my skin. It became softer and clearer. However I found that my make up used to clump a little after using it in the mornings so now I used it once a day before going to bed.</li>
            <li> Feels great, smells divine.</li>
            <li> Very high quality oil.  I am more than satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Pleasant scent and really improved the look and feel of hip area post-surgery.</li>
            <li> Amazing... It has been 1 week that I started using it. From day 1 onwards, it gives skin, a wonderful smooth, silky feeling... Smells very nice, too. Would definately buy it again..</li>
            <li> Love this product, thanks!!</li>
            <li> so far so good!  This seems to absorb quickly, and has sped up the healing on some damaged skin.  It&#x27;s also been great to use around the eyes.</li>
            <li> My skin appears to be less dry. It&#x27;s easy to use &amp; is not sticky or tackie like some products. A little goes a long way.  I would love to see what special products they have for your eyes.</li>
            <li> Great product - after just a few days of using it on my face, my complexion looked better and skin smoother.  Smells great too. It has now been over a week and I see a big difference on my skin - it is glowing! Love love this oil.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin E product has to be the best oil I have ever used! It gives my skin a beautiful glow and I have notice a major difference in the tone of my skin... Since I have used this product I have been receiving many compliments, I&#x27;m very happy that I invested in this 100% PURE VITAMIN E OIL!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> Great product works very well in the face cream I make.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t stop making this oil!! I love it and its only been a few days! Smell is WONDERFUL and goes on smooth and gives my skin a beautiful glow!</li>
            <li> During a recent facial I was advised to get vitamin e capsules and poke a hole to apply the oil to the dry patches on my face.  Upon reading the reviews for this product I decided this would be easier than buying the capsules.  I have since been using the oil on my entire face and love it.  I apply a few drops of the oil on my entire face at night (instead of my night cream) but it doesn&#x27;t feel oily on my skin.  I then apply another small dap to the dry spots in the morning before applying my make up.  I have only been using this product for a couple of weeks and I no longer have dry spots and my face is smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Appears to be helping skin tone and fine lines.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this oil to be very effective. By adding a few drops to my leave-in hair conditioner, my dry hair behaves as it should. I mix about 10&lt;br /&gt;drops to my conditioner for my entire head of hair. Problems of hair breakage and pesky split ends are in the past. I am very pleased with this&lt;br /&gt;product.</li>
            <li> Great oil! Arrived quickly too!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:7c904f2037cb9fc180b90607783691f8]] After a lengthy stint of bad skin--acne, flaky, fine lines-- I was desperate to figure out something to heal it.  Before I found the Vitamin E Enhance I was religiously washing my face, exfoliating, moisturizing, the whole nine yards without any results.  I replaced my moisturizer with this product; it has been essential in my search for clear skin!</li>
            <li> I put this around the eyes. Just one drop goes a long way. I&#x27;m noticing youthful skin. Less dry. Also it seems to reduce some of the dark spots. I put it once before going to bed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many products over the years and absolutely love this oil! My skin looked firmer and fine lines &amp;#34;seemed to disappear&amp;#34; after 2-3 days. I use it daily and only at night. Years ago I used vitamin E oil on my belly when pregnant and NEVER got stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Carefully packages for delivery. I would buy again!</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for about a week and my skin looks and feels a lot better. At first it was a little hard to apply it, but soon I found out that if I apply it on my wet face the oil goes more smoothly on my face. I only  use it at night but still my skin feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> Product is great, I currently have mine mixed with  organic Shea butter and I use it as a body butter for my entire body and face, I haven&#x27;t really noticed my dark spots lightening up yet but I have only been using it for a week but the good thing is, is that I have not had even one pimple and my face is extremely sensitive. I struggled a lot of years with acne until I stopped using all of those store products that had many hidden chemicals and went to a product that is all natural. For the past years the only products that didn&#x27;t cause my acne to flair up was using dove sensitive skin bar soap to wash my face and then using aveeno&#x27;s face moisturizer and this worked perfectly, but I feel as though the aveeno has not been making my dark marks disappear as it once did so I decided to try something new, which is this vitamin E mixed with Shea butter and so far I do not have any complaints, my skin is very oily and this too is oily when I put it on or it may be the Shea butter that&#x27;s oily but after I rub it in really good I don&#x27;t have an excessive amount of shine.....This product is great and I will continue to purchase and it also helps that the sellers are very customer friendly, after I ordered they even called to make sure that everything was okay.....I definitely recommend this item!</li>
            <li> I love how this makes my skin feel!!!</li>
            <li> Very good product!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> I love this oil, dark sports are almost gone , amazing !</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for it. Feel like it clogged my pores, I did see some slight improvements but I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to see. I started to use less than the recommended amount of drops because my face was very oil. Just didn&#x27;t do it for me! I mixed it in with my moisturizer because my skin was very dry at first, but still don&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It is not greasy, and it helps with lines, especially the smile lines around the eyes. Other vitamin e products I had tried made my face break out, but not this one.</li>
            <li> Great product.  A pure grade.  Non-synthetic.</li>
            <li> I like it! Good product.</li>
            <li> Our daughter had open heart surgery at 2.5 months old.  The doctors recommended Vitamin E oil to help her scar heal and minimize redness.  We have been using this product for about 2 months and it is making a huge difference.  The oil arrived quickly and is very easy to use.  We also rub it on her cheeks to cure the Extreme chapped dry skin she got from the hospital.  Works like a charm.  The company even called us personally to make sure we were satisfied with the product!  Almost a year and a half later...we still use it on our daughters chest scars.  Every doctor we&#x27;ve seen since her surgery has said its the most beautiful healing they&#x27;ve ever seen.  The scar is so faint.  We owe the beautiful results to this oil!</li>
            <li> Might I say that this vitamin e oil is amazing! My dad and I have been using it for the past couple of months and it truly a life changer, my dad was in a bad truck accident and had to get surgery done on his face so he had some pretty rough scars but he has been using this oil 3 times a day for 2 months and the scars have lightened tremendously! This stuff really can be used for anything I use it for dark circles under my eyes along with coconut oil and the dark circles are almost gone!! I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this oil. I must state that I did receive this item at a discounted rate in return for my honest opinion of the product, and this is it my honest opinion is buy this!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Good quality oil.</li>
            <li> Gentle on sensitive skin. Great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This organic oil is very soothing on dry skin. It soaks in nicely and I enjoy the subtle lavender fragrance. I use it on my face and arms.</li>
            <li> Love this oil blend! I&#x27;m using it twice a day and will be using it to make an eye cream. Thank you for the pure ingredients!</li>
            <li> This product is so wonderful. It goes on your skin so smooth and not sticky. It soaks right in to your skin leaving it very soft and hydrated. I will definately buy again and again. Great moisturizer!</li>
            <li> This is a great oil. It soaks into your skin really fabulously, and does not cause break-outs! (In warmer weather, just a dab will do, and for dry skin from cold weather, you can use it generously.) It also is a lovely thing to add into your skin care ritual, because it smells delicious, and the oil feels good on your fingers and skin as you rub it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a natural skin product where you can feel safe knowing every ingredient, this is really a good oil to try -- I recommend it highly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, since ordering the product, I&#x27;ve learned about the company, and I really like them. And they have amazing customer service. I will buy this product and other products from them again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of skincare products in the past and I&#x27;m usually disappointed. Some of them have worked a little bit but never anything to write home about.  Now, this Vitamin e is a different story...so much so that I decided to leave a review.  All I know is that the natural vitamin e must be the right thing for whatever skin type I have because after just a few short weeks, I can see a difference in some of the wrinkles I&#x27;ve have for the last several years. They are much smaller than before.  I care about how I look and don&#x27;t want to look too old too soon. This product is definitely helping.</li>
            <li> So far so good! It&#x27;s not very greasy, and has a&lt;br /&gt;wonderful fragrance.</li>
            <li> Leaves an oily residue on your skin. I have found other natural organic vitamin e oils available through amazon that don&#x27;t have that slippery oily feeling left on your skin that doesn&#x27;t last all day but keeps skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any difference in my skin after using it for 3-4 weeks. And did not expect too so soon. I will continue to use and hope to see some changes in the future. Otherwise it goes on slick and easy and after 30 to 40 minutes most of it is absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, Quality product, I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I bought this oil primarily because I recently had to have surgery.  I want it to heal without leaving such a nasty scar.  I have been using it there and am healing nicely.  I sometimes get dry skin, so I have tried it out on my face, neck and chest before bedtime.  I was rather oily when I went to bed, but I woke up with the smoothest, most supple skin.  I only use it once a week but my skin has never looked or felt better.  I love that it is organic also. This product lasts a long time because I only use a couple of drops in each area. I will keep buying this and plan to purchase more for my mom and sisters as gifts.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a very high quality, natural Vitamin&lt;br /&gt;E Oil and chose this product based on Amazon&#x27;s and the&lt;br /&gt;seller&#x27;s website description of it. I have not been&lt;br /&gt;disappointed and absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love, love, lobe this vitamin e oil. It soaks into your skin and hair, does not just sit on surface.</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing.  I put this on twice a day and makes my skin nice and soft.  I bought this for a scar on my face heard it was good going to see how it does.  So far so good</li>
            <li> It Works really great, Highly recomendable!!! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I wanted.  The oil is fine, not thick and has a few other essential oils to it that works and smells nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried some of the other products here on Amazon&lt;br /&gt;but all of them have been too sticky and hard to get out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;This one is perfect.  It comes out of the dropper easily and I use just a&lt;br /&gt;few drops every day and I can tell that this bottle will last me some time.&lt;br /&gt;Plus - I love that it&#x27;s all natural Vitamin E and not that synthetic crap&lt;br /&gt;all the other companies try to sell. Just wish I had found this earlier and&lt;br /&gt;not wasted my money on all that other stuff.</li>
            <li> Been using this morning and night after washing my face for about a week and I can already see the difference in the mirror! I love it!</li>
            <li> Very nice! Feels great on my skin! Love it! Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> I have used other oils and they seem to sit there...where as when i cleaned my face then dried it, i used this vitamin E oil and it makes my skin not feel sticky but though it takes about 5 minutes it absorbs better in my skin...now i use it all the time...love it!</li>
            <li> stunning product and worth every penny</li>
            <li> Great value, well packed, fast shipped. Can&#x27;t do better than that!</li>
            <li> If you are a woman of color looking for a natural moisturizer to help eliminate acne scars, this product is for you. At first I was hestitant to use an oil on my face. But after reading the reviews, I decided to give it a try.  In about three weeks, I have seen a significant improvement in my combination-type skin. My skin has gotten smoother and clearer. Using a toner with this product has provided even better results! I have been using this product twice a day, and it does not leave my skin oily. It is definitely worth the price and I will purchase it again!</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd week using this product on my face and so far I&#x27;m liking what I see.</li>
            <li> Best Vitamin E oil I have used.  It penetrates the skin fairly quickly, leaving it feeling soft.  I&#x27;m also pleased with the company&#x27;s quick delivery of their product.  My rating, obviously, shows the degree of satisfaction with the oil &amp; high recommendation with both the oil &amp; the company.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it instead of a moisturaser day and night time and extremely happy with results. Didn&#x27;t expect that from something that didn&#x27;t come in a jar and didn&#x27;t cost hundreds of dollars. Just made my second purchase.</li>
            <li> Vitamin E is the only thing I&#x27;ve ever found that actually does reduce wrinkles. I&#x27;ve used different Vitamin E products over the years and they always make a difference in reducing wrinkles around my eyes especially. This product did that too. It&#x27;s kind of like your face gets sanded and it reduces the depth of wrinkles, makes them less noticeable. What&#x27;s different about this product is the consistency. It&#x27;s more soft and silky feeling than other Vitamin E creams I&#x27;ve used. Very moisturizing. This stuff works.</li>
            <li> Tried it and like it.</li>
            <li> When it comes to the products I put on my skin, there are two things I consider: chemicals and origin. I don&#x27;t want any chemicals in the products and I prefer it to be made in the USA - and if by a small boutique shop that makes their products by hand all the better.  Check and check with this product. I&#x27;ve been looking at all the cancer-causing chemicals found in skincare, beauty, and hair products and it makes me weary. This product only had organic, natural ingredients in it. Huge plus. I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks now and I love it. Under eye lines are disappearing and some blemishes I&#x27;ve had for years are slowly fading away. Consistency is good, not too thick, goes on smooth. I love it. The money back guarantee doesn&#x27;t hurt. I&#x27;m very happy that I found an effective chemical-free product.</li>
            <li> its really not for oil skin at all.. My acne became worst..:(</li>
            <li> I have used Vitamin E oil on my face for years. This oil has more density than I am used to but it is absorbed in the skin quite rapidly. It has a lovely lavender scent&lt;br /&gt;which I find very soothing.</li>
            <li> So far, this is the only face oil that I&#x27;ve tried that really hydrates my skin &amp; doesn&#x27;t break me out! I have regular to dry skin &amp; I appy this twice daily and it makes my skin GLOW. My favorite thing about this product is the quality of it, I can tell apart from other drugstore brand that this is the real deal, try it &amp; you don&#x27;t be disappointed :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to turn 40 in a few months and have been seeing some apparent signs of wrinkles... as expected. A friend of mine had only great things to say, which had already turned 40, and said if there was anything to add to my regimen this was it. I bought this product and after two weeks, this product had smoothed out my fine lines under my eyes brought on by two young kids, sun, and age. Being the price seems much for the size it is, you&#x27;re only applying 3 drops on your face with your regular face cream in the morning and night. Not a major shift in your routine to get such amazing results. Totally worth it and I can&#x27;t see myself stopping this anytime soon.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I have bought products from this company before and when I saw they came out with a new all natural vitamin e oil, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I&#x27;ve tried others in the past be they&#x27;ve been too hard to use so I eventually would give up. Not this time! This vitamin E goes on so smooth and more important is how I look and how it makes me feel.  My forehead wrinkles are getting less noticeable and I even put it on some of my post-pregnancy stretch marks and it&#x27;s working wonders! I wish it came in a little bigger size though because I&#x27;ve heard vitamin E is good for your hair but I don&#x27;t want to use up this bottle too fast. A bigger bottle would also help for my belly but I guess I&#x27;ll just have to buy more.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought this stuff was kinda expensive. I saw other Vitamin E oils selling for a lot less but that made me wonder why the others were so cheap - so I did a bunch of research and now I know why, because the others use cheap Vitamin E that&#x27;s not real oil and they mix the Vitamin E in a cheap oil like soybean oil (which I&#x27;ve also heard is bad for you). This stuff is the real deal and real Vitamin E is just better for you! When I use it, my face feels so soft and the dark areas under my eyes are even getting better. To me, it&#x27;s worth the little extra money.</li>
            <li> Finally found something natural    I&#x27;m a raw foodist who really cares about what I put in and on my body. I love vitamin e because of all its great properties but before I found this product, all I could find was the synthetic version or the pure version that was to thick. I&#x27;m so glad that I finally found something natural and healthy and that goes on smooth. I like the fact that they used other healthy oils with the vitamin e. I put it on at night and in the morning, my skin feels so soft. The wrinkles are going away as well. I love healthy and I love this product.  Well worth it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff! I am prone to acne so I was worried that it would break my skin out but it has done the opposite! My skin has been clear and beautiful! So far it has eased my fine lines! I&#x27;m 33 so I am starting to get wrinkles. I even got compliments on my skin! I put it on 1 to 2x a day at night and in the morning. I can ware makeup over it with no problem. Love love love it! The only issue I have with it is cost and that since I use it so much I can see it going fast. It says use 4-5 drops on face snd neck but you need more like 10. However, I guess thats the cost of getting quality NON-synthtic ingredients. Other than that im a pretty satisfied customer!</li>
            <li> Because I&#x27;m in healthcare, I always look to see what the ingredients are in anything I put on my face and skin. The big companies always put chemicals and other bad ingredients in beauty products and I try to stay away from all those chemicals as much as possible. I was so excited to read the list of ingredients in this product. It only has organic and all natural ingredients in it and it&#x27;s all stuff that&#x27;s great for my skin. I&#x27;ve tried it now for a couple of months and my crowsfeet and the wrinkles under my eyes look much better. You should have seen the smile on my face the other day when somebody thought I was in my late 20s!  Let&#x27;s just say...uh...that I&#x27;m a lot older than that! I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> Love it!!  feels great on my face, not too greasy.  love using under my eyes, and on my hands and nails.</li>
            <li> I have been suffer from acne and acne scars. This product does not get too oily on the face, feel like just like applying night cream.  My skin has improved and glowing. My skin feel great after I applied the oil on it. Will recommend people use it!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!  I bought it initially for my dry skin, scars and blemishes, but then started using it in concoctions for cellulite wraps and stretch mark creams-- and it&#x27;s working FANTASTICALLY!!!  I&#x27;m really happy with this product, so I&#x27;m buying more!  Plus the company is wonderful!!  Such GREAT people!</li>
            <li> Love the product! I&#x27;m using it on my face, neck and décolletage.  I&#x27;ve already noticed my dark spots are fading!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I use it on my face and my nails.  I will definitely keep this on my frequent order list.</li>
            <li> Amazing product saw a difference after the first week !</li>
            <li> Though the serum did not work on my skin; I am, however, satisfied with the customer service. Upon submitting my review, the company gave me a full refund. I also talked with one of the agents discussing how the serum made my skin oily. The agent even  promised to help me with my skin problem by researching what serum can potentially work on my skin type.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s what you left as feedback:&lt;br /&gt; I absolutely love this oil! The smell is amazing and&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m currently using it for for daily/nightly skin care&lt;br /&gt; routine. I love how supple my skin feels afterwards. It&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt; still to early to tell if it&#x27;s making a difference in my&lt;br /&gt; skin appearance, but so far, I&#x27;m going to continue using&lt;br /&gt; it till the bottle&#x27;s out, then order more.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this oil.  I have used another similar product on Amazon, but after trying the Health Priority Natural Products Vitamin E Oil, I&#x27;m not going back to the old one.  My skin is smooth and clear, and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> This is an great product....I have been using it on my face twice a day .my skin looks great and feels smooth....love it</li>
            <li> Okay...this stuff is amazing. I used it in a hair mask and a facial mask--left on for an hour and my hair is shiny and bouncy and my skin looks great. &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two weeks now.  I really like the way it absorbs into my skin and leaves my face feeling soft with no dry areas.  It has a unique lavender odor to it that is quite soothing.  I am now using only this oil on my face and I love it.  Plus all natural, no chemicals which was probably the reason for the dry spots.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks and have seen some improvement in my dark spots</li>
            <li> I am a serious believer in this oil.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and my skin has such a healthy fresh glow and has stayed moisturized and non-reactive to the cold.  Highly recommend.  For my face, I wouldn&#x27;t trust another Vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li> I love this product! My skin feels so soft, smooth and looks clear.  My fine lines are diminished as well. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products for my skin and this is by far the best product I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for my face and luckily I didn&#x27;t breakout so that was a plus, I will start using this along with other natural oils for my eyelashes hopefully I will get great results</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Noticed a difference just after a couple uses.  Perfect amount of thickness and the smell is amazing.  It has helped heal my acne scars while helping to prevent new breakouts.  Never thought I would have to worry about acne in my 30&#x27;s, and I am so glad that I have found this serum to help heal these annoyances.  Great for those wrinkles that are bound to happen.  Give it a try and see for yourself</li>
            <li> Brought a glow to my skin, and I saw my winter-chapped skin soften. Great product!</li>
            <li> This product is the perfect addition to my lotion bars!</li>
            <li> Very good quality and top-notch customer service.  The oil blend softens my skin and leaves it looking rested and younger.  A bit pricey but worth it for the benefit to my skin.</li>
            <li> This has become a staple for me. I use ir right after a shower to prevent my face from trying to produce excess oil. I also use it as an aftershave which has completely stopped the redness I get after shaving.</li>
            <li> first time user of vitamin e oil, i love it. takes a&lt;br /&gt;few uses to get used to, my skin feels great</li>
            <li> A fabulous product!  I love everything about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that every ingredient is organic&lt;br /&gt;I love that it smells heavenly.  It&#x27;s like walking into a high-end spa every morning and at night.&lt;br /&gt;I love that it&#x27;s just oils and no chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;I love that it&#x27;s easy to apply and gets absorbed very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I love the way my skin looks and feels after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, there is nothing I don&#x27;t like about this product.  I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample for review.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Shipping was fast.  I ordered it, for use on my face, but I had hand surgery 4 weeks ago, and I use this on the scars during the day, in between the use of my scar serum.  My physical therapist can not believe how my hand looks!!</li>
            <li> This product makes me look and feel like a million bucks!  I use about 5 or 6 drops every evening and it looks like the bottle is going to last me a long time.  After about a month now, I can definitely notice a difference. I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s and have had some wrinkle problems for a few years now. Nothing I tried before was helping but now I&#x27;ve finally found something that works.  My wrinkles are disappearing day by day. It has to be the natural, instead of synthetic, vitamin-e that&#x27;s doing the trick. I don&#x27;t know what it is...I just know it works and that&#x27;s all I care about.</li>
            <li> excellent service and product</li>
            <li> Love it On my face and neck scar.</li>
            <li> Does not seem to do any healing on skin - will not purchase again.</li>
    </ol>
