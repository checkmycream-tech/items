    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed with the body it gives his</li>
            <li>This is one of the best that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>This Dove gel works great for him.</li>
            <li>and I am still buying that product because it has a great feel and smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has good hold without feeling sticky at all.  </li>
            <li>He feels that it is good gel that is ruined by an overpowering fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is a good product that provides hold and the illusion of thickness.</li>
            <li>Good choice for a teenager as it&#x27;s forgiving in use and holds restyling well.</li>
            <li>This is a good hair styling gel with a lemon/lime/cedar/sweet scent.  </li>
            <li>Good hold.</li>
            <li>Some gels are like super glue in that they make my hands feel incredibly sticky and my hair feel crusty.  </li>
            <li>I really look good!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product held nicely and did not feel overly greasy.  </li>
            <li>Nice lighweight gel.</li>
            <li>The gel is lightweight, scented nicely and does not leave hair crunchy or greasy looking.</li>
            <li>It has a mild scent and a mild hold that works best on damp hair.</li>
            <li>Very light odor and texture.</li>
            <li>More of a guy&#x27;s scent.</li>
            <li>In my youth, though, I used styling gels a lot more often because...</li>
            <li>I had a lot more hair.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit more versatile and my hair stays styled longer throughout the day while using the gel.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>While not my favorite, it is not objectionable.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the appearance and it seemed to add some volume.</li>
            <li>This would be a better styling gel in a fragrance-free formula.</li>
            <li>Between fragranced soap, deodorant, hair products and cologne, there can just be too many clashing fragrances converging.</li>
            <li>- I guess to perk it up :)  </li>
            <li>It also seems a bit more resilient to movement</li>
            <li>(i.e. touching your hair, etc).  </li>
            <li>know caffeine is the latest ingredient to be added to men&#x27;s hair care products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can always add more -</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great product with a nice &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m finding it holds better when I comb the gel through with the fine side of the comb.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m finding it holds better when I comb the gel through with the fine side of the comb.</li>
            <li>very good product, especially for the money.</li>
            <li>, I think this stuff is a great value for what you get - assuming that you want a natural look.  </li>
            <li>I use this on my 7 year old&#x27;s hair and it works great.</li>
            <li>Best to put on wet hair</li>
            <li>It holds his hair well and smells great (more strong on hands than later on hair which is good).&lt;br /&gt;Smell is manly but fresh and nice.</li>
            <li>but it is easily 10 times stronger than it needs to be.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is very mild, by the way, in my estimation.</li>
            <li>The scent is very mild, by the way, in my estimation.</li>
            <li>It does dissipate somewhat after it dries but it still might be too much if you have your own favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>This hair styling gel for men has a moderately strong barbershop cologne smell that fades as it dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a somewhat strong spicy fragrance.</li>
            <li>This gel doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, so it&#x27;s something that can be used by both of us.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The first thing you will notice is the overpowering scent, which is too strong and seems to want to replace your own cologne.</li>
            <li>just a dab is fine.</li>
            <li>Works fine.  </li>
            <li>and I would describe it as a light to medium hold gel.</li>
            <li>Light rinse is all it needs to remove from my palms.</li>
            <li>I started using Dove Men + Care products solely because they were available as evaluation samples through the Amazon Vine program.</li>
            <li>This is very light, both in hold and scent, which was exactly what we were looking for.</li>
            <li>It is easy to dispense, and washes off quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have to agree, the smell is super strong.</li>
            <li>This is more of a classic gel, but even though it says it is a strong hold, it doesn&#x27;t make your hair crusty, yet still holds it.  </li>
            <li>and my son feels special</li>
            <li>Even ten minutes after application, if I ran my hand through my hair, my hand felt sticky afterward, so rather than my hair having a clean and lightweight feel, it had a sticky feel that didn&#x27;t smell good anymore.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are many cheaper products out there, but this one does a great job with a small amount, making it affordable.</li>
            <li>If I could get him to use this everday, it would be the perfect compromise At least the gel works.</li>
            <li>The smell is kind of musky and masculine, although it&#x27;s not overpowering and does mellow out after awhile.</li>
            <li>so while it&#x27;s nice, I&#x27;m not really sure what it is good</li>
            <li>It does have a strong smell at first</li>
            <li>It provides a nice sheen, and certainly settled his locks down a bit, but neither of us liked either the scent, which was a strong musky odor, or the way our hair felt on our hands.</li>
            <li>To be clear - the scent is not bad, just very strong so be prepared for that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do prefer the products that have a fresh, clean scent rather than a stronger, cologne-like fragrance, which describes this styling gel.</li>
            <li>For the most part, I like the new Dove Men + Care line of products.</li>
            <li>It makes it easy to take along when traveling and can stand upright in the bathroom without needing much space.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>The white hairs (or gray hairs, if you think that way) are more brittle and don&#x27;t stay in place that easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is mild and the price is right.</li>
            <li>Good price for a fairly large tube that should last awhile.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice, a little better than the run of the mills gel from drugstore.</li>
            <li>Neither of us found the gel to be particularly useful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easily applied to moist hair with moist hands and provides moderate to strong stiffening effects depending on the amount used.  </li>
            <li>Although made for men, I tried it on my own hair first and later on my son&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>Not bad at all, and it certainly doesn&#x27;t linger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not bad at all, and it certainly doesn&#x27;t linger.  </li>
            <li>If I comb it after applying, it will clump more into wider strands and will be more crusty, but still not as much as with some other products.</li>
            <li>If I comb it after applying, it will clump more into wider strands and will be more crusty, but still not as much as with some other products.</li>
            <li>The smell is not overpowering but it does give off a strong masculine flavor and speaks of the person being well groomed.  </li>
            <li>This is standard hair gel, the premium kind where you don&#x27;t have to use too much to get the style you want.</li>
            <li>I said;)</li>
            <li>I will get more of this in the future.</li>
            <li>I only use about a dime sized amount or at most a nickel sized amount if my hair grows out a bit.</li>
            <li>First off,</li>
            <li>Dove Men + Care styling paste which not only held better but did not leave his hair looking like it was glued into place.&lt;br</li>
            <li>really is a good gel with my own personal complaint being the overpowering fragrance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find it is a bit strong smelling but not overpowering like another brand out there that we have tried and can no longer use due to way too strong</li>
            <li>My husband normally uses pastes (his favorites are Old Spice&#x27;s Spiffy and Dove&#x27;s) but this is his new favorite because the gel is easier to apply (he often gets too much paste in his hair which results in dullness).</li>
            <li>It does not cause flakes and washes out easily in the following shampoo.</li>
            <li>I tried this on my own thinning graying straight hair, and then on my 11 year old son&#x27;s thick, curly, and easily tangled hair.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a pretty good light to medium hold hair gel, but I only recommend it for men who like some added fragrance and aren&#x27;t combining it with a bunch of other fragranced products.</li>
            <li>I got so much product in it&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>, it grows what seems like straight up and out.</li>
            <li>do not need to use much at all</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does not leave their hair sticky and they really like when they can get it spikey.</li>
            <li>Really controls what I want it to control...</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t make much sense, but it is convenient.  </li>
            <li>really like the tube container too.  </li>
            <li>Use too much &amp; you will look like the 1990s.  </li>
            <li>If you need to revive your style after combing, dampen your comb with water to refresh - but not too much</li>
            <li>Really????</li>
            <li>Really????</li>
            <li>With the right amount (subjective) your hair still looks natural.</li>
            <li>It helps add some stiffness and control to my hair without making it feel crusty or even sticky when I run my hands through it, and my hands don&#x27;t feel sticky after applying it (sure, I still wash my hands, but it&#x27;s nothing like some other gels).  </li>
            <li>Use more for a wet look (yo Adrian!).</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got very good results with this Dove gel the following way: After washing my hair (with Dove Men + Care 2 in 1 Shampoo + Conditioner &amp;#34;infused&amp;#34; with menthol and caffeine!--more on caffeine later), I towel-dry it and then use about a pea-sized glob of gel, rub it in my hands with just a few drops of water, and then massage outward from the scalp.</li>
            <li>It disappears quickly  and gives a hold equal to the paste.  </li>
            <li>My shampoo and conditioners already claim to do this, and I haven&#x27;t had the need particularly for my hair gel to also do this...</li>
            <li>It comes up as safe on a few websites, but, really, why do all these things exist in things we put in and on our bodies?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>It comes up as safe on a few websites, but, really, why do all these things exist in things we put in and on our bodies?  </li>
            <li>We found that during periods of high humidity, the gel lost its oomph.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve liked the other Dove Men + Care products including their soap and body wash, but this one left me unimpressed.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is the same in both the styling gel and the styling paste – very manly and not unpleasant but a little too strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in late middle age, have a pretty full set of gray hair that&#x27;s now mostly white, with thinning up top and a nice, shiny spot where the &amp;#34;bald spot&amp;#34; typically goes in men my age.</li>
            <li>My 13 year old son wants to grow his hair out</li>
            <li>I normally use mousse to style my hair because I don&#x27;t like the stiffness that comes with using gel.</li>
            <li>His normal gel is LA Looks.</li>
            <li>, it start to look more matte after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easily and helps hold my spiky short Asian hair up.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Obviously the type of hair and what is trying to be accomplished is a factor, but he much preferred this same brand</li>
            <li>The smell is nice (not overpowering, a subtle masculine scent).  </li>
            <li>He likes something that helps hold it down, give it a smooth finish but not shiny at all.</li>
            <li>I then quickly style it using only my hands--a pretty traditional men&#x27;s style with part on the side--and then go about my business, letting it dry</li>
            <li>The gel inside is clear, no coloring added.</li>
            <li>Clear and non-greasy.</li>
            <li>I use it on my 4.5 year old son.</li>
            <li>It offers additional control while still feeling natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can only really smell it when I put some on my hands and lift it to my nose -</li>
            <li>At my age, I like a natural look - and this gel provides it.</li>
            <li>On the whole, I feel I can definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>I just want my hair to look natural and stay in place.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I like the natural look of hand styling, so it&#x27;s not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I like the natural look of hand styling, so it&#x27;s not a problem.  </li>
            <li>With that gone, my hair still stays very much in place all day long (unless it rains!).</li>
            <li>We both have straight heavy hair, and this gel does a nice job of holding some style if applied to wet hair without weighing it down too much.</li>
            <li>The upside is that it&#x27;s not too messy to apply and clean up.</li>
            <li>You only need a little squirt and its easily ran through hair.</li>
            <li>As long as you don&#x27;t use too much product, it won&#x27;t give you a goopy/crunchy look.  </li>
            <li>first, it feels that this provides no real hold, but as it dries it does its job well and keeps your hair shaped as it should.  </li>
            <li>works better for them on damp hair and if it gets too hard they will sometimes go back and comb over it</li>
            <li>When applied to dry hair, it can be used to get some texture and lift to straight hair.</li>
            <li>can get different levels of hold depending on how much product you use and the gel easily washes out without leaving behind any residue.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>When I was younger, I liked the extra shine and stiff look of other products.  </li>
            <li>general comments out of the way now, let&#x27;s go to this &amp;#34;fortifying&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Only a small amount is needed for a light to medium hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried gels like LA Looks, of various hold intensities, and more recently I had some decent results with the very expensive Baxter soft water pomade.</li>
            <li>This clear gel may be applied to damp or dry hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure he gets it from me, as I have very thick, long and would-be poofy hair if I didn&#x27;t use a dozen hair products on it and flat iron</li>
            <li>If I want, I run my fingers through my hair a little, breaking up the &amp;#34;crustier&amp;#34; spots gently, and it feels softer and still says the same throughout the day.</li>

            <li> I have to agree, the smell is super strong.</li>
            <li> This is more of a classic gel, but even though it says it is a strong hold, it doesn&#x27;t make your hair crusty, yet still holds it.  </li>
            <li> and my son feels special</li>
            <li> Even ten minutes after application, if I ran my hand through my hair, my hand felt sticky afterward, so rather than my hair having a clean and lightweight feel, it had a sticky feel that didn&#x27;t smell good anymore.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are many cheaper products out there, but this one does a great job with a small amount, making it affordable.</li>
            <li> If I could get him to use this everday, it would be the perfect compromise At least the gel works.</li>
            <li> The smell is kind of musky and masculine, although it&#x27;s not overpowering and does mellow out after awhile.</li>
            <li> so while it&#x27;s nice, I&#x27;m not really sure what it is good</li>
            <li> It does have a strong smell at first</li>
            <li> It provides a nice sheen, and certainly settled his locks down a bit, but neither of us liked either the scent, which was a strong musky odor, or the way our hair felt on our hands.</li>
            <li> To be clear - the scent is not bad, just very strong so be prepared for that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do prefer the products that have a fresh, clean scent rather than a stronger, cologne-like fragrance, which describes this styling gel.</li>
            <li> For the most part, I like the new Dove Men + Care line of products.</li>
            <li> It makes it easy to take along when traveling and can stand upright in the bathroom without needing much space.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> The white hairs (or gray hairs, if you think that way) are more brittle and don&#x27;t stay in place that easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is mild and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Good price for a fairly large tube that should last awhile.</li>
            <li> The scent is nice, a little better than the run of the mills gel from drugstore.</li>
            <li> Neither of us found the gel to be particularly useful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is easily applied to moist hair with moist hands and provides moderate to strong stiffening effects depending on the amount used.  </li>
            <li> Although made for men, I tried it on my own hair first and later on my son&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> Not bad at all, and it certainly doesn&#x27;t linger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not bad at all, and it certainly doesn&#x27;t linger.  </li>
            <li> If I comb it after applying, it will clump more into wider strands and will be more crusty, but still not as much as with some other products.</li>

            <li> The smell is not overpowering but it does give off a strong masculine flavor and speaks of the person being well groomed.  </li>
            <li> This is standard hair gel, the premium kind where you don&#x27;t have to use too much to get the style you want.</li>
            <li> I said;)</li>
            <li> I will get more of this in the future.</li>
            <li> I only use about a dime sized amount or at most a nickel sized amount if my hair grows out a bit.</li>
            <li> First off,</li>
            <li> Dove Men + Care styling paste which not only held better but did not leave his hair looking like it was glued into place.&lt;br</li>
            <li> really is a good gel with my own personal complaint being the overpowering fragrance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find it is a bit strong smelling but not overpowering like another brand out there that we have tried and can no longer use due to way too strong</li>
            <li> My husband normally uses pastes (his favorites are Old Spice&#x27;s Spiffy and Dove&#x27;s) but this is his new favorite because the gel is easier to apply (he often gets too much paste in his hair which results in dullness).</li>
            <li> It does not cause flakes and washes out easily in the following shampoo.</li>
            <li> I tried this on my own thinning graying straight hair, and then on my 11 year old son&#x27;s thick, curly, and easily tangled hair.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a pretty good light to medium hold hair gel, but I only recommend it for men who like some added fragrance and aren&#x27;t combining it with a bunch of other fragranced products.</li>
            <li> I got so much product in it&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> , it grows what seems like straight up and out.</li>
            <li> do not need to use much at all</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not leave their hair sticky and they really like when they can get it spikey.</li>
            <li> Really controls what I want it to control...</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t make much sense, but it is convenient.  </li>
            <li> really like the tube container too.  </li>
            <li> Use too much &amp; you will look like the 1990s.  </li>
            <li> If you need to revive your style after combing, dampen your comb with water to refresh - but not too much</li>
            <li> Really????</li>
            <li> Really????</li>
            <li> With the right amount (subjective) your hair still looks natural.</li>
            <li> It helps add some stiffness and control to my hair without making it feel crusty or even sticky when I run my hands through it, and my hands don&#x27;t feel sticky after applying it (sure, I still wash my hands, but it&#x27;s nothing like some other gels).  </li>
            <li> Use more for a wet look (yo Adrian!).</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got very good results with this Dove gel the following way: After washing my hair (with Dove Men + Care 2 in 1 Shampoo + Conditioner &amp;#34;infused&amp;#34; with menthol and caffeine!--more on caffeine later), I towel-dry it and then use about a pea-sized glob of gel, rub it in my hands with just a few drops of water, and then massage outward from the scalp.</li>
            <li> It disappears quickly  and gives a hold equal to the paste.  </li>
            <li> My shampoo and conditioners already claim to do this, and I haven&#x27;t had the need particularly for my hair gel to also do this...</li>
            <li> It comes up as safe on a few websites, but, really, why do all these things exist in things we put in and on our bodies?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> It comes up as safe on a few websites, but, really, why do all these things exist in things we put in and on our bodies?  </li>
            <li> We found that during periods of high humidity, the gel lost its oomph.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve liked the other Dove Men + Care products including their soap and body wash, but this one left me unimpressed.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is the same in both the styling gel and the styling paste – very manly and not unpleasant but a little too strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in late middle age, have a pretty full set of gray hair that&#x27;s now mostly white, with thinning up top and a nice, shiny spot where the &amp;#34;bald spot&amp;#34; typically goes in men my age.</li>
            <li> My 13 year old son wants to grow his hair out</li>
            <li> I normally use mousse to style my hair because I don&#x27;t like the stiffness that comes with using gel.</li>
            <li> His normal gel is LA Looks.</li>
            <li> , it start to look more matte after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> It goes on easily and helps hold my spiky short Asian hair up.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously the type of hair and what is trying to be accomplished is a factor, but he much preferred this same brand</li>
            <li> The smell is nice (not overpowering, a subtle masculine scent).  </li>
            <li> He likes something that helps hold it down, give it a smooth finish but not shiny at all.</li>
            <li> I then quickly style it using only my hands--a pretty traditional men&#x27;s style with part on the side--and then go about my business, letting it dry</li>
            <li> The gel inside is clear, no coloring added.</li>
            <li> Clear and non-greasy.</li>
            <li> I use it on my 4.5 year old son.</li>
            <li> It offers additional control while still feeling natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can only really smell it when I put some on my hands and lift it to my nose -</li>
            <li> At my age, I like a natural look - and this gel provides it.</li>
            <li> On the whole, I feel I can definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I just want my hair to look natural and stay in place.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I like the natural look of hand styling, so it&#x27;s not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I like the natural look of hand styling, so it&#x27;s not a problem.  </li>
            <li> With that gone, my hair still stays very much in place all day long (unless it rains!).</li>
            <li> We both have straight heavy hair, and this gel does a nice job of holding some style if applied to wet hair without weighing it down too much.</li>
            <li> The upside is that it&#x27;s not too messy to apply and clean up.</li>
            <li> You only need a little squirt and its easily ran through hair.</li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t use too much product, it won&#x27;t give you a goopy/crunchy look.  </li>
            <li> first, it feels that this provides no real hold, but as it dries it does its job well and keeps your hair shaped as it should.  </li>
            <li> works better for them on damp hair and if it gets too hard they will sometimes go back and comb over it</li>
            <li> When applied to dry hair, it can be used to get some texture and lift to straight hair.</li>
            <li> can get different levels of hold depending on how much product you use and the gel easily washes out without leaving behind any residue.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> When I was younger, I liked the extra shine and stiff look of other products.  </li>
            <li> general comments out of the way now, let&#x27;s go to this &amp;#34;fortifying&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Only a small amount is needed for a light to medium hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried gels like LA Looks, of various hold intensities, and more recently I had some decent results with the very expensive Baxter soft water pomade.</li>
            <li> This clear gel may be applied to damp or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure he gets it from me, as I have very thick, long and would-be poofy hair if I didn&#x27;t use a dozen hair products on it and flat iron</li>
            <li> If I want, I run my fingers through my hair a little, breaking up the &amp;#34;crustier&amp;#34; spots gently, and it feels softer and still says the same throughout the day.</li>

            <li> With that gone, my hair still stays very much in place all day long (unless it rains!).es a very slight feel of stiffness.</li>
            <li> Does not leave hair feeling unnaturally stiff unless you use too much.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical about the product line, but after a while I really started to like the brand consistency of this line geared for men.</li>
            <li> The large tube will last at least a couple months of daily use.</li>
            <li> The adult male in the vicinity was the test subject.</li>
            <li> (207 ml) tube has a flip cap and should last a long while.</li>
            <li> hold lasts for a long time, enough so that I am no longer even thinking about whether my hair has gel in it after a while</li>
            <li> On the other hand, when it stopped holding due to humidity, we found that we needed only to run our fingers through it with some water to make it come alive again.  </li>
            <li> Finally, I would really like to know if Unilever and the other brand giants really HAVE to put all these weird sounding chemicals in these products.</li>
            <li> Same as the shine and wet look</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have long hair</li>
            <li> applied to wet hair, a tiny bit can be diluted in your hand and applied to your hair.  </li>
            <li> Plus, as a child of the sixties, I&#x27;ve been known to let a long time go between haircuts, and the sides just start flipping out and up</li>

            <li> Not overpowering like Axe products, but not feminine like several other brands.</li>
            <li> There is a faint scent to it that is like other gels that I&#x27;ve used, but not as strong.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s almost dry.</li>
            <li> It was applied to dry hair and then, as directed, allowed to dry undisturbed.</li>

            <li> The whiter my hair has gotten, the harder it&#x27;s been to keep it in place.</li>
            <li> final look is not shiny like old-fashioned pomades or overly stiff and crunchy like heavier styling products, but neat and inconspicuous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used a few other Dove products, like the similar deodorant</li>

            <li> only issue is the fragrance is stronger than I prefer and not particularly appealing.</li>
            <li> The small amount needed means the tube will last quite awhile.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a small dab &amp; it holds the hair.  </li>
            <li> As is usually found with this type of product, the clear gel leaves a sticky residue on hands and when dry is hard and crusty in hair.</li>
            <li> the smell ruins it.</li>
            <li> This one leaves his hair less crunchy but again...</li>
            <li> : it&#x27;s not something we would buy again unless they come out with an unscented or significantly less fragrant version.</li>
            <li> so I start with less than I need (or think I need.)  </li>
            <li> Run wet hands through your hair to get it damp, put small amount on your fingers, work into your hair.  </li>
            <li> It makes it a little crustier, but I find I can run my fingers through my hair in just a few seconds and it breaks down the crusty feel.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I tried this on my own thinning graying straight hair, and then on my 11 year old son&#x27;s thick, curly, and easily tangled hair. Neither of us found the gel to be particularly useful. It provides a nice sheen, and certainly settled his locks down a bit, but neither of us liked either the scent, which was a strong musky odor, or the way our hair felt on our hands. Even ten minutes after application, if I ran my hand through my hair, my hand felt sticky afterward, so rather than my hair having a clean and lightweight feel, it had a sticky feel that didn&#x27;t smell good anymore. I&#x27;ve liked the other Dove Men + Care products including their soap and body wash, but this one left me unimpressed.</li>
            <li> I use it on my 4.5 year old son. It holds his hair well and smells great (more strong on hands than later on hair which is good).&lt;br /&gt;Smell is manly but fresh and nice. No residue on her and my son feels special (gel is for grown up I said;)</li>
            <li> This hair gel is thick, but not glob like thick.  It sort of reminds me of liquid hand soap.  It goes on easily and helps hold my spiky short Asian hair up.  It gives it the spiked look, but not the hard &amp;#34;don&#x27;t touch my hair I got so much product in it&amp;#34; type look.  It almost looks like I have no product in my hair, which is the sort of look I like.  It is easy to dispense, and washes off quickly.  I will get more of this in the future.</li>
            <li> This is very light, both in hold and scent, which was exactly what we were looking for. My 13 year old son wants to grow his hair out and I want it out of his eyes. If I could get him to use this everday, it would be the perfect compromise At least the gel works.</li>
            <li> My son has hair that just isn&#x27;t meant to have any length to it. Anything longer than a medium buzz cut and he gets the poofiest hair you&#x27;ve ever seen. I&#x27;m sure he gets it from me, as I have very thick, long and would-be poofy hair if I didn&#x27;t use a dozen hair products on it and flat iron it after I&#x27;ve dried it. The sheer weight of my long hair helps tame it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my son, with short hair, it grows what seems like straight up and out. If we don&#x27;t get his hair cut every 3 weeks or so it&#x27;s gets unruly. So when he&#x27;s due for a cut, but he has some time before he can get in, he uses a styling gel on his hair. He likes something that helps hold it down, give it a smooth finish but not shiny at all. This Dove gel works great for him. It gives his hair some hold, but doesn&#x27;t make his hair shine. He also likes the scent of it. More of a guy&#x27;s scent. Not overpowering like Axe products, but not feminine like several other brands. A little goes a long way for him, so one bottle is lasting him a long time. He loves it!</li>
            <li> My husband normally uses pastes (his favorites are Old Spice&#x27;s Spiffy and Dove&#x27;s) but this is his new favorite because the gel is easier to apply (he often gets too much paste in his hair which results in dullness). It disappears quickly  and gives a hold equal to the paste.  I&#x27;m very impressed with the body it gives his hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is mild and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Even with short hair, styling gel comes in handy at times to keep it from looking all disheveled - especially if I go an extra week without cutting it.  In my youth, though, I used styling gels a lot more often because...well...I had a lot more hair.  :)  This is one of the best that I&#x27;ve tried.  It offers additional control while still feeling natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has good hold without feeling sticky at all.  Some gels are like super glue in that they make my hands feel incredibly sticky and my hair feel crusty.  This gel is nothing like that.  It helps add some stiffness and control to my hair without making it feel crusty or even sticky when I run my hands through it, and my hands don&#x27;t feel sticky after applying it (sure, I still wash my hands, but it&#x27;s nothing like some other gels).  Like I said above, my hair still feels natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is muted, too.  There is a faint scent to it that is like other gels that I&#x27;ve used, but not as strong.  I can only really smell it when I put some on my hands and lift it to my nose - I don&#x27;t smell it at all after I&#x27;ve applied it.  I also like that it doesn&#x27;t add a bunch of shine to my hair like some other products do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At (currently) $6 for a 7-ounce tube, I think this stuff is a great value for what you get - assuming that you want a natural look.  When I was younger, I liked the extra shine and stiff look of other products.  At my age, I like a natural look - and this gel provides it.</li>
            <li> I normally use mousse to style my hair because I don&#x27;t like the stiffness that comes with using gel. That being said, the Dove Men gel works just as well as mousse. It&#x27;s a bit more versatile and my hair stays styled longer throughout the day while using the gel. Also you can reduce the stiffness feel by applying to hair that&#x27;s almost dry. If you like the stiffness or need to style in a way where your hair stays up or spikey, apply a little water. I only use about a dime sized amount or at most a nickel sized amount if my hair grows out a bit. Overall, it&#x27;s a great product with a nice &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; male scent.</li>
            <li> This hair styling gel for men has a moderately strong barbershop cologne smell that fades as it dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easily applied to moist hair with moist hands and provides moderate to strong stiffening effects depending on the amount used.  It works with or without a hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final look is not shiny like old-fashioned pomades or overly stiff and crunchy like heavier styling products, but neat and inconspicuous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 7 oz. (207 ml) tube has a flip cap and should last a long while.</li>
            <li> I have used a few other Dove products, like the similar deodorant and I am still buying that product because it has a great feel and smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Similarly, this is hair gel definitely for men.  First off, the feel when using this is not overly greasy at all.  Slipping it onto your fingers, and then your hair, it goes on easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, it feels that this provides no real hold, but as it dries it does its job well and keeps your hair shaped as it should.  I love the smell.  The smell is not overpowering but it does give off a strong masculine flavor and speaks of the person being well groomed.  If you are looking for a neutral gel, this isn&#x27;t for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hold lasts for a long time, enough so that I am no longer even thinking about whether my hair has gel in it after a while (and I should mention the smell dissipates after a while so that I forget I even out the gel in my hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very good product, especially for the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my husband try this for the past week. He feels that it is good gel that is ruined by an overpowering fragrance. I have to agree, the smell is super strong. It would not be unpleasant if it was not so potent but it is easily 10 times stronger than it needs to be.  His normal gel is LA Looks. This one leaves his hair less crunchy but again... the smell ruins it. Bottom line: it&#x27;s not something we would buy again unless they come out with an unscented or significantly less fragrant version.</li>
            <li> The men in this household like this styling gel. It works well for holding their hair in the style that they want.&lt;br /&gt;You do not need to use much at all just a dab is fine. I find it is a bit strong smelling but not overpowering like another brand out there that we have tried and can no longer use due to way too strong smelling.&lt;br /&gt;This works better for them on damp hair and if it gets too hard they will sometimes go back and comb over it a little&lt;br /&gt;to help to soften up the look.&lt;br /&gt;It does not leave their hair sticky and they really like when they can get it spikey.</li>
            <li> This clear gel may be applied to damp or dry hair. It has a somewhat strong spicy fragrance. While not my favorite, it is not objectionable. It contains caffeine which is reputed to thicken hair and may actually stimulate hair regrowth. I know it provided me with manageable body and a medium hold.Initially my hair felt coated. It wasn&#x27;t sticky or crunchy and the feel was minimized by combing.I was pleased with the appearance and it seemed to add some volume. It does not cause flakes and washes out easily in the following shampoo. This is a good product that provides hold and the illusion of thickness.</li>
            <li> Really controls what I want it to control... My hair is curly, but it needs to straighten when I need it to lay back. This fortifying styling gel helps so well. I really look good!!!</li>
            <li> As is usually found with this type of product, the clear gel leaves a sticky residue on hands and when dry is hard and crusty in hair. The adult male in the vicinity was the test subject. He has thick straight hair. The lightweight hold was insufficient to maintain even the simplest control – like keeping the hair from falling over his forehead. It was applied to dry hair and then, as directed, allowed to dry undisturbed. But, although the hair looked and felt like it contained product, it moved as if it did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously the type of hair and what is trying to be accomplished is a factor, but he much preferred this same brand’s Dove Men + Care styling paste which not only held better but did not leave his hair looking like it was glued into place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After four days of use he’s done and refuses to continue walking around with floppy yet crunchy hair. The fragrance is the same in both the styling gel and the styling paste – very manly and not unpleasant but a little too strong.</li>
            <li> This Dove Men+ Care Fortifying Gel works well and I would describe it as a light to medium hold gel. It can be used on wet or dry hair. Although made for men, I tried it on my own hair first and later on my son&#x27;s hair.  We both have straight heavy hair, and this gel does a nice job of holding some style if applied to wet hair without weighing it down too much. When applied to dry hair, it can be used to get some texture and lift to straight hair. Only a small amount is needed for a light to medium hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is the fragrance is stronger than I prefer and not particularly appealing. The smell is kind of musky and masculine, although it&#x27;s not overpowering and does mellow out after awhile. This would be a better styling gel in a fragrance-free formula. Between fragranced soap, deodorant, hair products and cologne, there can just be too many clashing fragrances converging. Overall, this is a pretty good light to medium hold hair gel, but I only recommend it for men who like some added fragrance and aren&#x27;t combining it with a bunch of other fragranced products.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a gel for the boys that would not have Axe’s Larry the lounge lizard smell.  Alas.</li>
            <li> I got Dove Men + Care Fortyfying Styling Gel for my bathroom to share with my roommate.  Between the two of us, we use lots of styling gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product held nicely and did not feel overly greasy.  However, it did not stand up well to humidity.  We found that during periods of high humidity, the gel lost its oomph.  On the other hand, when it stopped holding due to humidity, we found that we needed only to run our fingers through it with some water to make it come alive again.  This didn&#x27;t make much sense, but it is convenient.  On the whole, I feel I can definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is standard hair gel, the premium kind where you don&#x27;t have to use too much to get the style you want. It smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy. The large tube will last at least a couple months of daily use. The gel inside is clear, no coloring added.</li>
            <li> Works fine.  It does have a strong smell at first but it disappears when it dries out.  Same as the shine and wet look, it start to look more matte after a few minutes.  This is not your windy day styling gel.  I don&#x27;t have long hair but you will had reshape my hair when I spend some time in the open.  I don&#x27;t know what caffeine has to do in the ingredient - I guess to perk it up :)  I also like that it is not sticky on my hands.  Light rinse is all it needs to remove from my palms.</li>
            <li> This gel doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, so it&#x27;s something that can be used by both of us.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the tube container too.  It makes it easy to take along when traveling and can stand upright in the bathroom without needing much space.&lt;br /&gt;When applied to wet hair, a tiny bit can be diluted in your hand and applied to your hair.  The small amount needed means the tube will last quite awhile.  I appreciate that fact that it controls without making your hair stiff and crunchy.&lt;br /&gt;There are many cheaper products out there, but this one does a great job with a small amount, making it affordable.</li>
            <li> Not as sticky as I was hoping. The &amp;#34;strong hold&amp;#34; was not particularly strong... it holds my hair for maybe 3-4 hours. The upside is that it&#x27;s not too messy to apply and clean up. The scent is nice, a little better than the run of the mills gel from drugstore. It&#x27;s a big bottle so gets your money&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;fortifying&amp;#34; properties will unfortunately take time to prove its worth. My shampoo and conditioners already claim to do this, and I haven&#x27;t had the need particularly for my hair gel to also do this... so while it&#x27;s nice, I&#x27;m not really sure what it is good for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would likely not be specifically looking for this when I need to buy, but I wouldn&#x27;t mind if I get stuck with it.</li>
            <li> Nice lighweight gel. Not too aggressively scented. Good choice for a teenager as it&#x27;s forgiving in use and holds restyling well.</li>
            <li> This is more of a classic gel, but even though it says it is a strong hold, it doesn&#x27;t make your hair crusty, yet still holds it.  It also seems a bit more resilient to movement (i.e. touching your hair, etc).  The smell is nice (not overpowering, a subtle masculine scent).  Good price for a fairly large tube that should last awhile.</li>
            <li> I use this on my 7 year old&#x27;s hair and it works great. He like it because it is &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; and I like it because it shapes how I want it to. The gel is lightweight, scented nicely and does not leave hair crunchy or greasy looking. You only need a little squirt and its easily ran through hair. Best to put on wet hair so it dries with the hair and holds the shape.</li>
            <li> This is a good hair styling gel with a lemon/lime/cedar/sweet scent.  It only takes a small dab &amp; it holds the hair.  As long as you don&#x27;t use too much product, it won&#x27;t give you a goopy/crunchy look.  Use too much &amp; you will look like the 1990s.  There is hold even if you comb your hair.  If you need to revive your style after combing, dampen your comb with water to refresh - but not too much water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The caffeine supposed to help prevent hair loss……research is still being done on that claim.  I would not buy this product based on that claim.</li>
            <li> Very light odor and texture. Clear and non-greasy. Does not leave hair feeling unnaturally stiff unless you use too much. Running hands though hair does not leave product on hands. Good hold. Use more for a wet look (yo Adrian!).</li>
            <li> I started using Dove Men + Care products solely because they were available as evaluation samples through the Amazon Vine program. At first I was skeptical about the product line, but after a while I really started to like the brand consistency of this line geared for men. If Dove/Unilever is reading this, I have to say, though, that I don&#x27;t even know how to say the product name. Is it &amp;#34;Dove Men Plus Care etc...?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With general comments out of the way now, let&#x27;s go to this &amp;#34;fortifying&amp;#34; styling gel. I&#x27;m in late middle age, have a pretty full set of gray hair that&#x27;s now mostly white, with thinning up top and a nice, shiny spot where the &amp;#34;bald spot&amp;#34; typically goes in men my age. The whiter my hair has gotten, the harder it&#x27;s been to keep it in place. The white hairs (or gray hairs, if you think that way) are more brittle and don&#x27;t stay in place that easily. Plus, as a child of the sixties, I&#x27;ve been known to let a long time go between haircuts, and the sides just start flipping out and up and I look weird and mad-scientist-like (eccentric genius, I like to think).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried gels like LA Looks, of various hold intensities, and more recently I had some decent results with the very expensive Baxter soft water pomade. All these were too stiff for my comfort, though. I don&#x27;t want spikes, and I don&#x27;t want hard hair. I just want my hair to look natural and stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got very good results with this Dove gel the following way: After washing my hair (with Dove Men + Care 2 in 1 Shampoo + Conditioner &amp;#34;infused&amp;#34; with menthol and caffeine!--more on caffeine later), I towel-dry it and then use about a pea-sized glob of gel, rub it in my hands with just a few drops of water, and then massage outward from the scalp. I then quickly style it using only my hands--a pretty traditional men&#x27;s style with part on the side--and then go about my business, letting it dry naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result is that my hair stays in place throughout the day and only gives a very slight feel of stiffness. If I want, I run my fingers through my hair a little, breaking up the &amp;#34;crustier&amp;#34; spots gently, and it feels softer and still says the same throughout the day. If I comb it after applying, it will clump more into wider strands and will be more crusty, but still not as much as with some other products. But I like the natural look of hand styling, so it&#x27;s not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical about the caffeine when I tried the shampoo originally, but I have read about some studies that link caffeine with slightly fuller hair growth. Using the shampoo and the gel, I get a double dose of what is probably a minuscule amount of caffeine. It&#x27;s the last item on the ingredients list, so there&#x27;s probably only a trace of it. I have no idea if it does anything about creating a fuller look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very mild, by the way, in my estimation. Not bad at all, and it certainly doesn&#x27;t linger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I would really like to know if Unilever and the other brand giants really HAVE to put all these weird sounding chemicals in these products. This stuff contains something called &amp;#34;dimethylaminoethylmethacrylate copolymer&amp;#34; in it. Really???? It comes up as safe on a few websites, but, really, why do all these things exist in things we put in and on our bodies?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit/Addition 8/4/15: My hair has gotten a little longer and I&#x27;m finding it holds better when I comb the gel through with the fine side of the comb. It makes it a little crustier, but I find I can run my fingers through my hair in just a few seconds and it breaks down the crusty feel. With that gone, my hair still stays very much in place all day long (unless it rains!).es a very slight feel of stiffness.

            <li> For the most part, I like the new Dove Men + Care line of products. I do prefer the products that have a fresh, clean scent rather than a stronger, cologne-like fragrance, which describes this styling gel. The first thing you will notice is the overpowering scent, which is too strong and seems to want to replace your own cologne. It does dissipate somewhat after it dries but it still might be too much if you have your own favorite cologne. To be clear - the scent is not bad, just very strong so be prepared for that.&lt;br /&gt;The gel itself does hold well, and does not include any alcohol so it&#x27;s not at all drying.&lt;br /&gt;I know caffeine is the latest ingredient to be added to men&#x27;s hair care products. I have no idea if it works or if the small amount in this gel would make a diffence anyway but it&#x27;s there for those who want to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;You can get different levels of hold depending on how much product you use and the gel easily washes out without leaving behind any residue.&lt;br /&gt;This really is a good gel with my own personal complaint being the overpowering fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;But that&#x27;s just me so everyone should try it out for themselves.</li>
            <li> It has a mild scent and a mild hold that works best on damp hair. Bed head?  Run wet hands through your hair to get it damp, put small amount on your fingers, work into your hair.  Brush into place. Done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can always add more - so I start with less than I need (or think I need.)  If you go overboard you will get the fake crispy/shiny look. With the right amount (subjective) your hair still looks natural.</li>
