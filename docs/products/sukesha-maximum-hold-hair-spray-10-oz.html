            <li>This spray is great - not too heavy, and still has great hold throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>Washes out easily.</li>
            <li>Came very quickly and I am going to order another...</li>
            <li>It is a strong holding hairspray.  </li>
            <li>I prefer a fine mist spray that has a strong hold.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair, but alot of it</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this product does the best job at holding my style without being stiff.  </li>
            <li>This hairspray is great for holding up-dos, especially if you have fly away ends that don&#x27;t get caught in the holder when you pull your hair back.  </li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent to it, and can be brushed out easy.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and packaged to prevent damage.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it works for me and my baby fine hair to keep it in place for as long as I need it to be.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s god super hold but can also be brushed out easily when it&#x27;s time for bed.</li>
            <li>It works better to shap short hair that any gel I have purchased.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light enough to spray and still use your fingers to fix your hair before it sets, also.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>I do like however that the smell is not as noticeable as many other sprays.</li>
            <li>to go back to BIG SEXY HAIR since they are similar.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sorry they are not making this product any more, it is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>Great hold, but a little stiff.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and it leaves my hair soft, yet it holds the style even in windy weather!</li>
            <li>natural and non sticky hold.....</li>
            <li>Love this hairspray, a little DOES GO A LONG WAY!!!!</li>
            <li>This spray comes out a bit to wet and heavy for my fine hair.</li>
