    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Jergens neither dries out nor causes skin to break out; neither clogs the sinuses nor causes them to drain; while working beautifully for every family member from youngest to oldest.</li>
            <li>jergens is a great bar soap.</li>
            <li>This soap is great if you have skin allergies.</li>
            <li>It is good for the family.</li>
            <li>so I was thrilled to find a good supply via Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately I can still buy it on Amazon!!</li>
            <li>Gentle and non drying and fragrance free which is perfect for allergy sufferers</li>
            <li>Jergens mild soap is a good choice for those of us who want soap that lathers up well in the shower or at the bathroom sink; and I suppose that you could use this at the kitchen sink as well if you wanted to do so.</li>
            <li>I use instead of shampoo which most men can do, and that saves me maybe $100 per year.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind buying so many bars.</li>
            <li>I love this soap -- no smell.</li>
            <li>LOVE THE SMELL.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I am allergic to most soaps and Jergens works well for me.  </li>
            <li>This soap doesn&#x27;t turn to mush in the shower and it rinses off easily.  </li>
            <li>ITS EASY ON THE SKIN AND DOESN&#x60;T MELT</li>
            <li>The soap is fine.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I have used this brand for many years, as it is mild and we don&#x27;t have any allergic issues from it.</li>
            <li>It is cheap, not scented.</li>
            <li>It used to be available in ALL stores.</li>
            <li>so I am very glad amazon.com offers it.</li>
            <li>It leaves me feeling clean and refreshed after every shower; that&#x27;s what I want</li>
            <li>The bar of soap is just the right size, too, which makes it easy to hold onto in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is an odourless soap, mild in action, keeps skin healthy and clean.</li>
            <li>Very mild and does not wash away too fast like some soaps.</li>
            <li>One of the only soaps that doesn&#x27;t give me any kind of skin reaction.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I really like Jergens mild bath soap.</li>
            <li>Very gentle.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous soap for people who have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It lathers up pretty good and the bars are reasonably long lasting.</li>
            <li>AS FAST.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The price was way too HIGH</li>
            <li>only potential downside is that there&#x27;s a somewhat mild yet noticeable \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; scent to this soap.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>I need that because some other brands are so strong they make me cough all day long.</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin and this is the only soap that never irritates my skin.</li>
            <li>Cleans as well as any soap I have ever used and does not dry my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a heavy duty moisturizer like Dove, yet it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry like Zest, Coast, or Safeguard.</li>

            <li> I use instead of shampoo which most men can do, and that saves me maybe $100 per year. It&#x27;s the ONLY soap I can do tha with.</li>
            <li> jergens is a great bar soap. not available in any stores in the north woods.</li>
            <li> Could not find in local groceries. Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This soap is great if you have skin allergies. Gentle and non drying and fragrance free which is perfect for allergy sufferers</li>
            <li> Hard to find. WalGreens stopped carriying it. At least it doesn&#x27;t go bad, so I don&#x27;t mind buying so many bars.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. Arrived in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> This soap cleans extremely well and doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering scent. I need that because some other brands are so strong they make me cough all day long. It&#x27;s not a heavy duty moisturizer like Dove, yet it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry like Zest, Coast, or Safeguard. It lathers up pretty good and the bars are reasonably long lasting. I shower every day and go through about one bar a month.</li>
            <li> One of the only soaps that doesn&#x27;t give me any kind of skin reaction. Very gentle. Hard to find in stores where I live so I am very glad amazon.com offers it.</li>
            <li> Jergens mild soap is a good choice for those of us who want soap that lathers up well in the shower or at the bathroom sink; and I suppose that you could use this at the kitchen sink as well if you wanted to do so. It leaves me feeling clean and refreshed after every shower; that&#x27;s what I want so it does the job well. The bar of soap is just the right size, too, which makes it easy to hold onto in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only potential downside is that there&#x27;s a somewhat mild yet noticeable \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; scent to this soap. If you are allergic to scented products or simply prefer unscented soap, keep looking for unscented bath soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like Jergens mild bath soap. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous soap for people who have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love this soap -- no smell.</li>
            <li> Hard to find this soap in local stores so I was thrilled to find a good supply via Amazon.  This soap doesn&#x27;t turn to mush in the shower and it rinses off easily.  I have sensitive skin and this soap does not bother me at all.</li>
            <li> It is cheap, not scented. With wrapper removed for storage lasts forever.  Cleans as well as any soap I have ever used and does not dry my skin.  Can no longer find it in stores. Removing the wrapper before storing prolongs life and makes it last longer while in use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Jergens for almost 30 years. It used to be available in ALL stores. Today, I can find it only at Dollar Tree or through Amazon. Jergens neither dries out nor causes skin to break out; neither clogs the sinuses nor causes them to drain; while working beautifully for every family member from youngest to oldest. In my life, Kirk&#x27;s Castile soap is for my face and hair. Jergens soap is for everything else.</li>
            <li> THIS IS PROBABLY MY SECOND OR THIRD ORDER AND ONLY MY SON USES IS. HE WAS USING PROACTIVE, BUT IT WAS EXPENSIVE, I STARTED BUYING JERGENS FOR HIM BECAUSE  ITS EASY ON THE SKIN AND DOESN&#x60;T MELT AS FAST.  IT  SEEMS TO LAST LONGER. LOVE THE SMELL.</li>
            <li> My product was what I ordered and came in the mail, what seemed like immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for what I wish all my orders were like.</li>
            <li> This is an odourless soap, mild in action, keeps skin healthy and clean. I love it. It is good for the family.</li>
            <li> The soap is fine.  The price was way too HIGH</li>
            <li> My husband and I have used this brand for many years, as it is mild and we don&#x27;t have any allergic issues from it. But starting about 3 or 4 years ago, the markets and pharmacies in our area quit carrying it. Fortunately I can still buy it on Amazon!!</li>
            <li> I have only used this soap for as long as I can remember - 30+ years.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and this is the only soap that never irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to most soaps and Jergens works well for me.  I have used it for over 30 years.  Hard to find in stores so I always order from Amazon.  Very mild and does not wash away too fast like some soaps.</li>
