    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I waited to review this product until I&#x27;ve used it for some time, and I can now say that I&#x27;m very happy with the results!</li>
            <li>When I came across this, it just seemed perfect, since it has all of those ingredients, and I can just spray and pray, and not have to touch my face.  </li>
            <li>No sticky feeling and works great.</li>
            <li>They need to update their sprayer, otherwise great product.</li>
            <li>Best salicylic acid product I&#x27;ve found yet though, smells nice with the menthol/peppermint.</li>
            <li>It also feels good on the skin and is not drying.  </li>
            <li>The quantity is good for the price, but that&#x27;s about it for me.</li>
            <li>He loved it and it worked</li>
            <li>but I feel like it was a good purchase.</li>
            <li>And it feels very refreshing on the skin, it also has peppermint oil in it</li>
            <li>I was very pleased to receive this product.</li>
            <li>the smell is pleasant and fades very quickly.</li>
            <li>I use another product that works great, but is alcohol based so it really stings.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice to have it available in a spray bottle.</li>
            <li>I had to pour it into a better spray bottle</li>
            <li>have had more luck with Glytone products...</li>
            <li>also, as others have noted, should be able to spray upside-down, in my opinion</li>
            <li>Works great, has a nice natural smell to it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product to add to your normal skincare routine.</li>
            <li>It has a nice mild scent and you feel it working in</li>
            <li>The spray makes it easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that natural products with clove, tea tree extract, and vinegar bases have helped a lot more, are better for me, and smell nice.</li>
            <li>I use this for body acne because its super easy to apply.</li>
            <li>love how much product you get in the bottle.</li>
            <li>for the actual using of the spray, the nozzle gives you really good even distribution, and it dries fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>Luckily the smell goes away when it dries.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a spray for a high concentration of Salicylic Acid to use on my body, and came across this product, and I love it.</li>
            <li>I bought this as an easier alternative to using Stridex wipes on my back, but it broke me out more than I was originally.</li>
            <li>right where my sports bra straps lie.  </li>
            <li>Just turn it right side up, pump the bottle, then try spraying again.  </li>
            <li>I use it often and I am still on my first bottle.</li>
            <li>and that can be pretty drying when I use it on my face and chest.</li>
            <li>Between this spray hot showers, and the supplements, it seems I&#x27;ve found a miracle cure for warts.  </li>
            <li>This does a really good job for body breakouts, the only reason I give it 4 stars is because it is made with grain ethanol (isn&#x27;t that the same thing in Everclear??)</li>
            <li>The downsides: It leaves your face really shiny, so it kinda looks grungy, and it makes your eyelids feel kinda sticky.  </li>
            <li>Much better than other salicylic spays out there.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a shot since everyone is different...</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t know if I can blame it on just this, as I&#x27;ve also been taking L-lysine and garlic supplements, and taking extremely hot showers (anything above 160° will kill viruses)</li>
            <li>Liked using it, but I am not sure if it worked?!?!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m already seeing the skin on my body clear up.</li>
            <li>Skin is sensitive to the pH values of products, and my guess is this one was just off.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have breakouts every now and then.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several products for my bacne and this is one of the least effective.</li>
            <li>Fantastic little product to have around!</li>
            <li>Within two days of starting this, all acne is completely gone.  </li>
            <li>I had been using Neutrogena Body Clear Body Spray, which was only a 4oz bottle, and I believe only .5 or 1% Salicylic acid.</li>
            <li>The spray bottle doesn&#x27;t work very well upside down, and it can be a bit tricky to get it to spray.  </li>
            <li>The peppermint fragrance seems absolutely unnecessary, but it&#x27;s kind of a nice touch until you get sick of smelling it.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Life-Flo Salicyclic acid spray and used it in the same exact way: a few sprays after showering.</li>

            <li> I recently had my face break out in flat warts.  </li>
            <li> Better concentration and works better on serious outbreaks, even the tiny red annoying cysts that runs in my pasty-white skin family.  </li>
            <li> The usual cure is salicylic acid, but the usual wart stuff is way too strong for your face.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste it or chance getting it in the air by spraying it directly on the skin.</li>
            <li> But it has not irritated my skin or made it dry.</li>
            <li> I tried a different cheaper brand out of a pressurized can and the stickiness after the product dried was a big issue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap, but the bottle is big and will last you.</li>
            <li> I use this almost daily for about two months and have well over half a bottle.</li>
            <li> The only con to this product is if you want to use this on your back, this sprayer stops after a few sprays when upside down.  </li>
            <li> Keep your eyes closed while using, and DO NOT let this drip into your eyes.  </li>
            <li> I used this as a body spray on my back and saw results within a few days of using.</li>
            <li> Seeing as I have OCD, it&#x27;s been really hard, as now in addition to all the other stuff I have been uncomfortable touching</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s working or not because I&#x27;m using a few different things at the same time,</li>
            <li> As such, I have been pretty desperate to get rid of them.  </li>
            <li> However, the pump does not spray upside down</li>
            <li> Also, because of where I need to spray this product it would be helpful for it to come equipped with the ability to spray it upside down.</li>
            <li> I typically have breakouts in my sports bra region.</li>
            <li> that your skin feels a little tight when it dries.</li>
            <li> and  refused to pump at all after just a few uses.  </li>
            <li> I also use it as a refresher/toner on my face- however for that I spray it on a cotton round and apply with that.</li>
            <li> I think by doing that I may have actually made things worse.</li>
            <li> This may have made a small improvement, but I&#x27;m not completely sure.</li>
            <li> Other remedies I&#x27;ve read are colloidal silver, (wtf?)  </li>
            <li> No, it&#x27;s not perfect.  </li>
            <li> It will burn like crazy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too bad though.  </li>

            <li> Much better than other salicylic spays out there. No sticky feeling and works great. I tried a different cheaper brand out of a pressurized can and the stickiness after the product dried was a big issue.</li>
            <li> The only con to this product is if you want to use this on your back, this sprayer stops after a few sprays when upside down.  They need to update their sprayer, otherwise great product.</li>
            <li> This stuff rocks!  Better concentration and works better on serious outbreaks, even the tiny red annoying cysts that runs in my pasty-white skin family.  Spray it on a cotton ball or cosmetic pad - don&#x27;t waste it or chance getting it in the air by spraying it directly on the skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on ingrown hairs after bikini waxing. I use another product that works great, but is alcohol based so it really stings. This product works on ingrown hairs and also on facial acne. The spray makes it easy to apply. I use it often and I am still on my first bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice to have it available in a spray bottle.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a spray for a high concentration of Salicylic Acid to use on my body, and came across this product, and I love it. I had been using Neutrogena Body Clear Body Spray, which was only a 4oz bottle, and I believe only .5 or 1% Salicylic acid. I needed something stronger, and the Life-Flo spray contains 2% acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now while this product doesn&#x27;t claim to be intended for treatment of acne, but for exfoliation, anyone who does their research would know that Salicylic Acid is also used for Acne treatment. It also contains Tea Tree Oil which is another ingredient used in a lot of acne treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how much product you get in the bottle. 8 oz is a lot! And it feels very refreshing on the skin, it also has peppermint oil in it so it cools off the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m already seeing the skin on my body clear up. I will be buying this product again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I like the scent of this spray.  It also feels good on the skin and is not drying.  However, the pump does not spray upside down and  refused to pump at all after just a few uses.  I had to pour it into a better spray bottle so I could use up the rest.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several products for my bacne and this is one of the least effective. The quantity is good for the price, but that&#x27;s about it for me. I&#x27;ve found that natural products with clove, tea tree extract, and vinegar bases have helped a lot more, are better for me, and smell nice. Also, because of where I need to spray this product it would be helpful for it to come equipped with the ability to spray it upside down.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me nor my partner... have had more luck with Glytone products... also, as others have noted, should be able to spray upside-down, in my opinion</li>
            <li> This may have made a small improvement, but I&#x27;m not completely sure. It&#x27;s worth a shot since everyone is different...</li>
            <li> I use this almost daily for about two months and have well over half a bottle. I use it as a body spray after workouts to combat any breakouts, as well as after waxing to avoid any ingrown hairs. I also use it as a refresher/toner on my face- however for that I spray it on a cotton round and apply with that. Works great, has a nice natural smell to it. Fantastic little product to have around!</li>
            <li> I bought this as an easier alternative to using Stridex wipes on my back, but it broke me out more than I was originally. Now I&#x27;m using Stridex again to fix the damage this product did. Skin is sensitive to the pH values of products, and my guess is this one was just off.</li>
            <li> I found this at a local health food store and gave it a try. I have sensitive skin and have breakouts every now and then. This does a really good job for body breakouts, the only reason I give it 4 stars is because it is made with grain ethanol (isn&#x27;t that the same thing in Everclear??) and that can be pretty drying when I use it on my face and chest. Best salicylic acid product I&#x27;ve found yet though, smells nice with the menthol/peppermint.</li>
            <li> I waited to review this product until I&#x27;ve used it for some time, and I can now say that I&#x27;m very happy with the results! I typically have breakouts in my sports bra region. After showering I always used to (wrongfully) spray scented body sprays on my shoulders and upper back thinking that the alcohol content was enough and/or would help control breakouts. I think by doing that I may have actually made things worse. I bought the Life-Flo Salicyclic acid spray and used it in the same exact way: a few sprays after showering. It has a nice mild scent and you feel it working in that your skin feels a little tight when it dries. But it has not irritated my skin or made it dry. It&#x27;s a great product to add to your normal skincare routine.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son who has acne issues on his back.  He loved it and it worked so well I bought it a second time and will probably continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I have back acne right where my sports bra straps lie.  Within two days of starting this, all acne is completely gone.  I had no issues with sensitivity of my skin and the smell is pleasant and fades very quickly.</li>
            <li> I recently had my face break out in flat warts.  Seeing as I have OCD, it&#x27;s been really hard, as now in addition to all the other stuff I have been uncomfortable touching, I get to add my face to that list.  As such, I have been pretty desperate to get rid of them.  I read online several things that help remove warts.  The usual cure is salicylic acid, but the usual wart stuff is way too strong for your face.  Other remedies I&#x27;ve read are colloidal silver, (wtf?)  L-lysine, and tea tree oil among others.  When I came across this, it just seemed perfect, since it has all of those ingredients, and I can just spray and pray, and not have to touch my face.  Now I don&#x27;t know if I can blame it on just this, as I&#x27;ve also been taking L-lysine and garlic supplements, and taking extremely hot showers (anything above 160° will kill viruses) but i&#x27;m only almost done with one bottle, and it&#x27;s made a 100% improvement.  The smaller ones just kinda went away, and the bigger ones have been flaking off layer by layer.  Between this spray hot showers, and the supplements, it seems I&#x27;ve found a miracle cure for warts.  It doesn&#x27;t rid you of acne entirely, but it does help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the actual using of the spray, the nozzle gives you really good even distribution, and it dries fairly quickly.  The peppermint fragrance seems absolutely unnecessary, but it&#x27;s kind of a nice touch until you get sick of smelling it.  Luckily the smell goes away when it dries.  I&#x27;ve accidentally gotten a bit of peppermint taste in my mouth.  It&#x27;s not too bad though.  The downsides: It leaves your face really shiny, so it kinda looks grungy, and it makes your eyelids feel kinda sticky.  Keep your eyes closed while using, and DO NOT let this drip into your eyes.  It will burn like crazy.</li>
            <li> I used this as a body spray on my back and saw results within a few days of using. It&#x27;s not cheap, but the bottle is big and will last you.</li>
            <li> I use this for body acne because its super easy to apply. It smells minty and not chemically!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s working or not because I&#x27;m using a few different things at the same time, but I feel like it was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Liked using it, but I am not sure if it worked?!?!</li>
            <li> This product has worked well for me this summer.  My back acne has definitely improved since I started using it.  No, it&#x27;s not perfect.  The spray bottle doesn&#x27;t work very well upside down, and it can be a bit tricky to get it to spray.  That&#x27;s not a big deal though, and seems unavoidable.  Just turn it right side up, pump the bottle, then try spraying again.  I will buy this again!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to receive this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for a while, and it works as well as products three times the price.</li>
