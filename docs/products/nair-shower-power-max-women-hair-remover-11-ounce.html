            <li>and I was very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve very glad</li>
            <li>1st let me say that I used this product EXACTLY how the directions said and it worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li>It works amazing</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still burning, and stuff is still coming out of them, to be honest, they kind of look like</li>
            <li>Very strong smell</li>
            <li>but this one has been the best by far.</li>
            <li>My lower legs tends to be coarser, but my thighs are very fine.</li>
            <li>I should have known anything that could disolve my hair was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective at removing hair but its really, really strong.</li>
            <li>it comes time to wash off the formula, and you&#x27;re not feeling the sponge because let&#x27;s be honest: it just collects all the hair and breaks apart easily.</li>
            <li>Well, I gladly threw this out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried in on my legs.</li>
            <li>the chemicals took out the top layer of skin on most of my leg and my fingers i was using the product with.</li>
            <li>Follow the lead of most women.</li>
            <li>Anyways, after having a kid, my body decided to produce more leg and underarm hair.</li>
            <li>probably OK if you havent.  </li>
            <li>So I said, ok I won&#x27;t give up on the product just yet.  </li>
            <li>It came off like magic ...</li>
            <li>I would also suggest you do not use this product more than once a week.</li>
            <li>This bottle contains many Brazilian \\&quot;waxes\\&quot; - you will not run out</li>
            <li>Wipe in one direction, each time rinsing the sponge, until you remove most all of cream.  </li>
            <li>I wish they could&#x27;ve made it with better material, but it is what it is.</li>
            <li>Once you try it, I promise you&#x27;ll run around ask all your friends and family to touch your smooth legs, arms or wherever it is you&#x27;ve used Nair Shower Power Max on! :</li>
            <li>I wish they could&#x27;ve made it with better material, but it is what it is.</li>
            <li>Once you try it, I promise you&#x27;ll run around ask all your friends and family to touch your smooth legs, arms or wherever it is you&#x27;ve used Nair Shower Power Max on! :-)</li>
            <li>, the hair is off, along with what appears to be the top layer or two of skin.  </li>
            <li>I went to school and most the day it hurt</li>
            <li>and then it turns into more like hives....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disappointed I was bleeding most the day.</li>
            <li>I think it is way better since it is a chemical</li>
            <li>the better.</li>
            <li>If you are using one that works good right now, don&#x27;t buy this one because of the shower hoax.  </li>
            <li>but as of now, my legs have never felt more smooth.</li>
            <li>far it&#x27;s worked great.</li>
            <li>Applying it with the sponge was easy.  </li>
            <li>It works great last longer than shaving now u love showing my legs</li>
            <li>It still has a strong smell, but nothing soap and water cannot handle</li>
            <li>It worked perfectly fine for me.</li>
            <li>It come off in huge clumps and if you keep buffing our skin with it all the hair is removed.  </li>
            <li>My legs to feel really smooth</li>
            <li>My skin feels just as smooth as when I use the buffing pads.</li>
            <li>I think the people who have had this stuff burn them probably rubbed it in, just smooth light paint strokes.  </li>
            <li>completely smooth</li>
            <li>I was rubbing the sponge in a circular motion, again like I was instructed, it either completely filled up with the cream, or it started folding into itself because it was so flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Perfect for people with coarse hair as it does an amazing job with hair removal from the body especially in that area.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not stupid, I know 2-3 mins is not going to work on me.</li>
            <li>I dont think it should be applied again before that because im pretty sure it will cause irritation.  </li>
            <li>Only try this at your own risk!)</li>
            <li>but I got a clean shave in 3 minutes so it is worth it!</li>
            <li>hair growth is huge while pregnant, mine went into remission (except for the hair on my head...</li>
            <li>/&gt;The \\&quot;specially designed\\&quot; sponge is just the cheapest foam they could find.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t give a full review</li>
            <li>and he had NO bad reaction.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it it worked pretty good left les very smooth.</li>
            <li>I hope they come up with a more natural way to rid yourself of hair quick and easy.</li>
            <li>I hope they come up with a more natural way to rid yourself of hair quick and easy.</li>
            <li>but this product, huge mistake, will take a month or more to clear up that acne and to get rid of post-inflammatory hyper-pigmentation.</li>
            <li>Overall though the product manage to get the job done though I think it works best for legs, but beware of your skin type before doing it so as it says in the item try it before putting it over an entire area.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very pleased with this product as it removed 98% of the hairs on my leg, even with me not truly knowing what i was doing.  </li>
            <li>I did first under the shower water and lightly using the bumpy side of the sponge</li>
            <li>I also used it along my bikini line, and the amount of pain I experienced was not worth it.</li>
            <li>Applicator sponge is great for my wife to apply and doesn&#x27;t get her all messy.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;ll be worth it to me.</li>
            <li>I know it says not to touch it with your fingers, but if you&#x27;re not afraid</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth every cent.)</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth every cent.)</li>
            <li>My legs feel like they would about 12 hours after a fresh shave.</li>
            <li>I had no results worth making this purchase worth it.</li>
            <li>Was it worth the pain?</li>
            <li>I used the sponge and to my surprise the hair was coming right off.</li>
            <li>, maybe this is it sinking in and doing it&#x27;s job, right?</li>
            <li>right before a date tonight.  </li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>As it turned out, only the areas that started burning (the first areas I covered) had any effective hair removal.</li>
            <li>I think a bottle lasts me 3-4 months depending on how fast the hair grows and how clean I want my legs to look (ie.</li>
            <li>Hell I&#x27;ve fallen in love with the product so much, that if I really need it to prepare for an event I just hit up a local pharmacy and purchase it there (a couple of dollars more</li>
            <li>Hell I&#x27;ve fallen in love with the product so much, that if I really need it to prepare for an event I just hit up a local pharmacy and purchase it there (a couple of dollars more</li>
            <li>Your hair-catch will be full of semi-dissolved hair; it&#x27;s super gross and it takes some scrubbing to clean.</li>
            <li>I have very very course hair</li>
            <li>first problem I encountered was that the cream smells like horse piss, which added to the unpleasantness of the experience.  </li>
            <li>, there were exactly zero fewer hairs on my body after I&#x27;d finished the agonizing process.  </li>
            <li>I did EXACTLY</li>
            <li>the first time you use this on your legs it works.</li>
            <li>and it left me skin soft and mostly hair free.</li>
            <li>In any case, this product is mediocre at best.</li>
            <li>In any case, this product is mediocre at best.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly</li>
            <li>I used the opposite side of the sponge in a circular motion and removed most of the hairs.  </li>
            <li>but if it burns me like it did the first time, I won&#x27;t use it again.</li>
            <li>This was the first depilatory I ever used and it turned me off of them forever.</li>
            <li>I left it on for about 1 more minute after doing both legs (meaning the first leg had already had two minutes</li>
            <li>Ladies, make sure not to get it inside your private parts, as it will burn.  </li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m okay with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Just be sure you rinse off any extra once you&#x27;ve finished applying the amount to your desired area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>I applied the cream to my legs first.</li>
            <li>At first everything appeared to be going</li>
            <li>put the product on his upper arms, butt, lower back and upper legs and it worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li>At first it worked , removing all the hair not burning me</li>
            <li>(This was my first hair removal of the spring</li>
            <li>I first applied it</li>
            <li>Save your money and just invest in a few good razors and shave gel instead.</li>
            <li>After purchasing Nair, for at least the third time now: I finally feel confident in giving a review on this wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although, it didn&#x27;t do as good a job as I&#x27;d hoped (considering I&#x27;ve almost gone through 1/3 of the bottle and only gotten moderate results for $9.</li>
            <li>Although, it didn&#x27;t do as good a job as I&#x27;d hoped (considering I&#x27;ve almost gone through 1/3 of the bottle and only gotten moderate results for $9.</li>
            <li>but I have sensitive skin, so I did the patch test as it instructed (did it for 10 minutes, on the underside of my arm, as that&#x27;s the most sensitive area</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have course or light hair, I would say I&#x27;m right in the middle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 20yo girl, first real time using a product like this</li>
            <li>Everyone should definitely use it my full recommendation!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so important to check your legs first prior to putting this on!&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve done this a couple of times, fingers are still perfectly fine sometimes just left with the scent)</li>
            <li>and i had huge red marks on my skin</li>
            <li>I used the product as directed on my legs and removed the product when I could remove a couple hairs by gently scraping with my fingernail (after 8 minutes).  </li>
            <li>They have been doing this practically their whole lives.</li>
            <li>I bought the Nair Max because I have very course hair.</li>
            <li>so I figured it was ready.</li>
            <li>This product really exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>The egg crate sponge they included made it so much</li>
            <li>stuff is fast.  </li>
            <li>and I noticed the hair was already shriveled and ready to come</li>
            <li>very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is all thanks to the fact that I deal with PCOS.</li>
            <li>After removing the Nair, your skin feels completely smooth and it&#x27;s left smelling fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t leave this on longer, or I really might have had to take it to the hospital.  </li>
            <li>I also smell, even after very thoroughly washing off.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for NOTHING Nair</li>
            <li>It took the entire bottle but both my legs are now hair free from the ankles to my bikini area.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I was hesitant to try this because I have very coarse hair on my legs, like man hair coarse.</li>
            <li>My face and neck are red, warm to the touch, and have red sores all over.</li>
            <li>I got more hair off than first encounter, but STILL had to use a razor, albeit a moderate to lesser extent than before.</li>
            <li>I got more hair off than first encounter, but STILL had to use a razor, albeit a moderate to lesser extent than before.</li>
            <li>Razors have improved so much over the years that I can shave both legs in much less time than this goop &amp; get better results.</li>
            <li>I used warm water and the sponge in small circular motions and it got everything off.</li>
            <li>I tend to avoid depilatories as a rule on myself, as I have found that, on my upper body, they work, but, for whatever reason, not one has worked on my legs, and I, more often than not, have the same irritation issue on my legs as most previous reviewers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very convenient for the busy people out there!</li>
            <li>It may be a good product if you leave it on long enough, i left it on for like two mins and it took off the majority just for a test run.</li>
            <li>Even though have a high level of a pain thresh hold, I was in pain.</li>
            <li>Just because you are rinsing the hair off your body does not mean the product still is not on your skin so remove it with soap and a wash</li>
            <li>I bought this product and the first time i tried it, nothing major has happened.</li>
            <li>For the most part (I still have a little stubble here and there).</li>
            <li>I figured that was normal.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gonna burn, or it&#x27;s not going to work, those are pretty much your only options if you don&#x27;t want to shave, pluck or wax it away.</li>
            <li>But, it takes longer &amp; is more trouble than just shaving.  </li>
            <li>But apparently a small section wasn&#x27;t a good enough indication.     </li>
            <li>So I applied this to where it was thickest so as I get in the shower I feel irritation on my legs and figure it&#x27;s just like a normal irritation</li>
            <li>and then I just did my normal routine</li>
            <li>finished me normal showering routine and got out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not hard to apply it, although the sponge that comes along with hair remover is quite flimsy: it&#x27;s still managable.</li>
            <li>The third problem is that using a piece of glorified sandpaper on legs that already feel like they&#x27;re been torched causes a kind of agony that I can&#x27;t express without stringing together half a dozen curse words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When the product is placed, the smell is very strong and not very pleasant.</li>
            <li>She has very sensitive skin though and</li>
            <li>have to warn you that this does smell, so if you have a very sensitive nose and dislike chemical smells, this is not for you.</li>
            <li>yet cuz I only did a test spot first on my wrist area.</li>
            <li>Product worked well the first time &amp; second time on LIMBS!</li>
            <li>I was used to shaving maybe two times a week, or every other week if I was lucky.</li>
            <li>For everyone else: steer clear.</li>
            <li>is just slowly growing back which is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>This does not work please do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li>I have coarse hair and after much debate</li>
            <li>As the directions stated, I did not let the shower spray hit my legs directly</li>
            <li>I suggest you do not leave it on pass 7 minutes if your skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li>Use it on my 11 year old...</li>
            <li>Around sensitive areas, I use fingers rather than the sponge.  </li>
            <li>I wait one minute (sometimes 1.5 minutes), then get in the shower and make an effort not to stand directly under the water.  </li>
            <li>I think people with really sensitive skin will get a reaction out of almost anything</li>
            <li>I have the sensitive version as well, and it did nothing.</li>
            <li>Do not use if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Follow the directions closely to not get sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>have to sleep between two soft towels because I can&#x27;t stand the feeling of the sheets on my legs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Today, the day after I used it, my legs are a complete mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 25, and I been shaving my legs since I was around 14 years old.</li>
            <li>Also if you want to try this product make sure you wait a few days or a week from your last shave.  </li>
            <li>First let me say that I normally do not shave, wax or exfoliate my legs.  </li>
            <li>this product on a small part of my leg, and it seemed fine.</li>
            <li>Since I hadn&#x27;t shaved in a few days, I decided to go ahead and get the more expensive one ( but the one that seemed to take the most hair away ), Nair:</li>
            <li>Despite NOT having my legs in direct contact with the shower head water (it trickled from my upper torso, down) as per the bottle, the stuff was coming right off.</li>
            <li>legs are not in much better condition, they are bright pink (like I have a bad sunburn), have red splotches on them, and the same red spots that are on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;There maybe a few straggling hairs left, wait a couple hours to clean those up.  </li>
            <li>It says it \\&quot;even works on coarse hair,\\&quot; which is a complete lie.  </li>
            <li>As a female, of course it had caused me to deal with self-esteem issues as well as the feeling to just never want to get near people, in fear of them judging me for how hairy my arms or my legs would look.</li>
            <li>so I am left in questions as to how some sensitive skin people can use this with no reaction.</li>
            <li>He is a red head, semi sensitive skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;After barely being in the shower, I noticed that where I had applied the cream was burning.</li>
            <li>no hair, but day 2 was about the same amount as I normally get, however, it was in patches (likely because the water washing away some of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how the other versions work, but this one worked really well OUT OF THE SHOWER.  </li>
            <li>I put it on both my legs, exactly as instructed; not 5 minutes later, as I was about to get into the shower, I noticed some dark spots appearing in the cream.</li>
            <li>I hurried to wash it off (almost slipping several times in the process, thanks to this stuff)</li>
            <li>When I first applied the cream, my skin started tingling and to burn a little.</li>
            <li>I may try this again for major hair removal, but next time with gloves.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done this multiple times (less now though) since my first experience and each time</li>
            <li>This product may not remove every single hair if you don&#x27;t leave it on for the right amount of time, so I normally leave it on for a few extra minutes (five to ten, and my skin is never harmed by it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to anyone who really has self-esteem issues due to their hair problems.</li>

            <li>The second time however it did not remove my hair in certain areas, (left stubble on legs) yet burned the skin completlety off in other areas</li>
            <li>and when i removed it I was left with burn marks, which are not very cute and burns so much!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another tip, if you have sensitive skin (I do) use Benadryl lotion on your skin immediately after you dry yourself off.  </li>
            <li>Anyways, it&#x27;s worth a try for hard to remove hair.</li>

            <li> and I was very pleased.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve very glad</li>
            <li> 1st let me say that I used this product EXACTLY how the directions said and it worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li> It works amazing</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still burning, and stuff is still coming out of them, to be honest, they kind of look like</li>
            <li> Very strong smell</li>
            <li> but this one has been the best by far.</li>
            <li> My lower legs tends to be coarser, but my thighs are very fine.</li>
            <li> I should have known anything that could disolve my hair was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effective at removing hair but its really, really strong.</li>
            <li> it comes time to wash off the formula, and you&#x27;re not feeling the sponge because let&#x27;s be honest: it just collects all the hair and breaks apart easily.</li>
            <li> Well, I gladly threw this out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried in on my legs.</li>
            <li> the chemicals took out the top layer of skin on most of my leg and my fingers i was using the product with.</li>
            <li> Follow the lead of most women.</li>
            <li> Anyways, after having a kid, my body decided to produce more leg and underarm hair.</li>
            <li> probably OK if you havent.  </li>
            <li> So I said, ok I won&#x27;t give up on the product just yet.  </li>
            <li> It came off like magic ...</li>
            <li> I would also suggest you do not use this product more than once a week.</li>
            <li> This bottle contains many Brazilian \\&quot;waxes\\&quot; - you will not run out</li>
            <li> Wipe in one direction, each time rinsing the sponge, until you remove most all of cream.  </li>
            <li> I wish they could&#x27;ve made it with better material, but it is what it is.</li>
            <li> Once you try it, I promise you&#x27;ll run around ask all your friends and family to touch your smooth legs, arms or wherever it is you&#x27;ve used Nair Shower Power Max on! :</li>

            <li> , the hair is off, along with what appears to be the top layer or two of skin.  </li>
            <li> I went to school and most the day it hurt</li>
            <li> and then it turns into more like hives....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disappointed I was bleeding most the day.</li>
            <li> I think it is way better since it is a chemical</li>
            <li> the better.</li>
            <li> If you are using one that works good right now, don&#x27;t buy this one because of the shower hoax.  </li>
            <li> but as of now, my legs have never felt more smooth.</li>
            <li> far it&#x27;s worked great.</li>
            <li> Applying it with the sponge was easy.  </li>
            <li> It works great last longer than shaving now u love showing my legs</li>
            <li> It still has a strong smell, but nothing soap and water cannot handle</li>
            <li> It worked perfectly fine for me.</li>
            <li> It come off in huge clumps and if you keep buffing our skin with it all the hair is removed.  </li>
            <li> My legs to feel really smooth</li>
            <li> My skin feels just as smooth as when I use the buffing pads.</li>
            <li> I think the people who have had this stuff burn them probably rubbed it in, just smooth light paint strokes.  </li>
            <li> completely smooth</li>
            <li> I was rubbing the sponge in a circular motion, again like I was instructed, it either completely filled up with the cream, or it started folding into itself because it was so flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Perfect for people with coarse hair as it does an amazing job with hair removal from the body especially in that area.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not stupid, I know 2-3 mins is not going to work on me.</li>
            <li> I dont think it should be applied again before that because im pretty sure it will cause irritation.  </li>
            <li> Only try this at your own risk!)</li>
            <li> but I got a clean shave in 3 minutes so it is worth it!</li>
            <li> hair growth is huge while pregnant, mine went into remission (except for the hair on my head...</li>
            <li> /&gt;The \\&quot;specially designed\\&quot; sponge is just the cheapest foam they could find.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t give a full review</li>
            <li> and he had NO bad reaction.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it it worked pretty good left les very smooth.</li>
            <li> I hope they come up with a more natural way to rid yourself of hair quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I hope they come up with a more natural way to rid yourself of hair quick and easy.</li>
            <li> but this product, huge mistake, will take a month or more to clear up that acne and to get rid of post-inflammatory hyper-pigmentation.</li>
            <li> Overall though the product manage to get the job done though I think it works best for legs, but beware of your skin type before doing it so as it says in the item try it before putting it over an entire area.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very pleased with this product as it removed 98% of the hairs on my leg, even with me not truly knowing what i was doing.  </li>
            <li> I did first under the shower water and lightly using the bumpy side of the sponge</li>
            <li> I also used it along my bikini line, and the amount of pain I experienced was not worth it.</li>
            <li> Applicator sponge is great for my wife to apply and doesn&#x27;t get her all messy.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll be worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I know it says not to touch it with your fingers, but if you&#x27;re not afraid</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth every cent.)</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth every cent.)</li>
            <li> My legs feel like they would about 12 hours after a fresh shave.</li>
            <li> I had no results worth making this purchase worth it.</li>
            <li> Was it worth the pain?</li>
            <li> I used the sponge and to my surprise the hair was coming right off.</li>
            <li> , maybe this is it sinking in and doing it&#x27;s job, right?</li>
            <li> right before a date tonight.  </li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> As it turned out, only the areas that started burning (the first areas I covered) had any effective hair removal.</li>
            <li> I think a bottle lasts me 3-4 months depending on how fast the hair grows and how clean I want my legs to look (ie.</li>
            <li> Hell I&#x27;ve fallen in love with the product so much, that if I really need it to prepare for an event I just hit up a local pharmacy and purchase it there (a couple of dollars more</li>
            <li> Hell I&#x27;ve fallen in love with the product so much, that if I really need it to prepare for an event I just hit up a local pharmacy and purchase it there (a couple of dollars more</li>
            <li> Your hair-catch will be full of semi-dissolved hair; it&#x27;s super gross and it takes some scrubbing to clean.</li>
            <li> I have very very course hair</li>
            <li> first problem I encountered was that the cream smells like horse piss, which added to the unpleasantness of the experience.  </li>
            <li> , there were exactly zero fewer hairs on my body after I&#x27;d finished the agonizing process.  </li>
            <li> I did EXACTLY</li>
            <li> the first time you use this on your legs it works.</li>
            <li> and it left me skin soft and mostly hair free.</li>
            <li> In any case, this product is mediocre at best.</li>
            <li> In any case, this product is mediocre at best.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly</li>
            <li> I used the opposite side of the sponge in a circular motion and removed most of the hairs.  </li>
            <li> but if it burns me like it did the first time, I won&#x27;t use it again.</li>
            <li> This was the first depilatory I ever used and it turned me off of them forever.</li>
            <li> I left it on for about 1 more minute after doing both legs (meaning the first leg had already had two minutes</li>
            <li> Ladies, make sure not to get it inside your private parts, as it will burn.  </li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m okay with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Just be sure you rinse off any extra once you&#x27;ve finished applying the amount to your desired area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> I applied the cream to my legs first.</li>
            <li> At first everything appeared to be going</li>
            <li> put the product on his upper arms, butt, lower back and upper legs and it worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li> At first it worked , removing all the hair not burning me</li>
            <li> (This was my first hair removal of the spring</li>
            <li> I first applied it</li>
            <li> Save your money and just invest in a few good razors and shave gel instead.</li>
            <li> After purchasing Nair, for at least the third time now: I finally feel confident in giving a review on this wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although, it didn&#x27;t do as good a job as I&#x27;d hoped (considering I&#x27;ve almost gone through 1/3 of the bottle and only gotten moderate results for $9.</li>
            <li> Although, it didn&#x27;t do as good a job as I&#x27;d hoped (considering I&#x27;ve almost gone through 1/3 of the bottle and only gotten moderate results for $9.</li>
            <li> but I have sensitive skin, so I did the patch test as it instructed (did it for 10 minutes, on the underside of my arm, as that&#x27;s the most sensitive area</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have course or light hair, I would say I&#x27;m right in the middle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 20yo girl, first real time using a product like this</li>
            <li> Everyone should definitely use it my full recommendation!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so important to check your legs first prior to putting this on!&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve done this a couple of times, fingers are still perfectly fine sometimes just left with the scent)</li>
            <li> and i had huge red marks on my skin</li>
            <li> I used the product as directed on my legs and removed the product when I could remove a couple hairs by gently scraping with my fingernail (after 8 minutes).  </li>
            <li> They have been doing this practically their whole lives.</li>
            <li> I bought the Nair Max because I have very course hair.</li>
            <li> so I figured it was ready.</li>
            <li> This product really exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li> The egg crate sponge they included made it so much</li>
            <li> stuff is fast.  </li>
            <li> and I noticed the hair was already shriveled and ready to come</li>
            <li> very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is all thanks to the fact that I deal with PCOS.</li>
            <li> After removing the Nair, your skin feels completely smooth and it&#x27;s left smelling fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t leave this on longer, or I really might have had to take it to the hospital.  </li>
            <li> I also smell, even after very thoroughly washing off.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for NOTHING Nair</li>
            <li> It took the entire bottle but both my legs are now hair free from the ankles to my bikini area.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I was hesitant to try this because I have very coarse hair on my legs, like man hair coarse.</li>
            <li> My face and neck are red, warm to the touch, and have red sores all over.</li>
            <li> I got more hair off than first encounter, but STILL had to use a razor, albeit a moderate to lesser extent than before.</li>
            <li> I got more hair off than first encounter, but STILL had to use a razor, albeit a moderate to lesser extent than before.</li>
            <li> Razors have improved so much over the years that I can shave both legs in much less time than this goop &amp; get better results.</li>
            <li> I used warm water and the sponge in small circular motions and it got everything off.</li>
            <li> I tend to avoid depilatories as a rule on myself, as I have found that, on my upper body, they work, but, for whatever reason, not one has worked on my legs, and I, more often than not, have the same irritation issue on my legs as most previous reviewers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very convenient for the busy people out there!</li>
            <li> It may be a good product if you leave it on long enough, i left it on for like two mins and it took off the majority just for a test run.</li>
            <li> Even though have a high level of a pain thresh hold, I was in pain.</li>
            <li> Just because you are rinsing the hair off your body does not mean the product still is not on your skin so remove it with soap and a wash</li>
            <li> I bought this product and the first time i tried it, nothing major has happened.</li>
            <li> For the most part (I still have a little stubble here and there).</li>
            <li> I figured that was normal.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gonna burn, or it&#x27;s not going to work, those are pretty much your only options if you don&#x27;t want to shave, pluck or wax it away.</li>
            <li> But, it takes longer &amp; is more trouble than just shaving.  </li>
            <li> But apparently a small section wasn&#x27;t a good enough indication.     </li>
            <li> So I applied this to where it was thickest so as I get in the shower I feel irritation on my legs and figure it&#x27;s just like a normal irritation</li>
            <li> and then I just did my normal routine</li>
            <li> finished me normal showering routine and got out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hard to apply it, although the sponge that comes along with hair remover is quite flimsy: it&#x27;s still managable.</li>
            <li> The third problem is that using a piece of glorified sandpaper on legs that already feel like they&#x27;re been torched causes a kind of agony that I can&#x27;t express without stringing together half a dozen curse words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When the product is placed, the smell is very strong and not very pleasant.</li>
            <li> She has very sensitive skin though and</li>
            <li> have to warn you that this does smell, so if you have a very sensitive nose and dislike chemical smells, this is not for you.</li>
            <li> yet cuz I only did a test spot first on my wrist area.</li>
            <li> Product worked well the first time &amp; second time on LIMBS!</li>
            <li> I was used to shaving maybe two times a week, or every other week if I was lucky.</li>
            <li> For everyone else: steer clear.</li>
            <li> is just slowly growing back which is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> This does not work please do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I have coarse hair and after much debate</li>
            <li> As the directions stated, I did not let the shower spray hit my legs directly</li>
            <li> I suggest you do not leave it on pass 7 minutes if your skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li> Use it on my 11 year old...</li>
            <li> Around sensitive areas, I use fingers rather than the sponge.  </li>
            <li> I wait one minute (sometimes 1.5 minutes), then get in the shower and make an effort not to stand directly under the water.  </li>
            <li> I think people with really sensitive skin will get a reaction out of almost anything</li>
            <li> I have the sensitive version as well, and it did nothing.</li>
            <li> Do not use if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions closely to not get sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> have to sleep between two soft towels because I can&#x27;t stand the feeling of the sheets on my legs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Today, the day after I used it, my legs are a complete mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 25, and I been shaving my legs since I was around 14 years old.</li>
            <li> Also if you want to try this product make sure you wait a few days or a week from your last shave.  </li>
            <li> First let me say that I normally do not shave, wax or exfoliate my legs.  </li>
            <li> this product on a small part of my leg, and it seemed fine.</li>
            <li> Since I hadn&#x27;t shaved in a few days, I decided to go ahead and get the more expensive one ( but the one that seemed to take the most hair away ), Nair:</li>
            <li> Despite NOT having my legs in direct contact with the shower head water (it trickled from my upper torso, down) as per the bottle, the stuff was coming right off.</li>
            <li> legs are not in much better condition, they are bright pink (like I have a bad sunburn), have red splotches on them, and the same red spots that are on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;There maybe a few straggling hairs left, wait a couple hours to clean those up.  </li>
            <li> It says it \\&quot;even works on coarse hair,\\&quot; which is a complete lie.  </li>
            <li> As a female, of course it had caused me to deal with self-esteem issues as well as the feeling to just never want to get near people, in fear of them judging me for how hairy my arms or my legs would look.</li>
            <li> so I am left in questions as to how some sensitive skin people can use this with no reaction.</li>
            <li> He is a red head, semi sensitive skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;After barely being in the shower, I noticed that where I had applied the cream was burning.</li>
            <li> no hair, but day 2 was about the same amount as I normally get, however, it was in patches (likely because the water washing away some of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how the other versions work, but this one worked really well OUT OF THE SHOWER.  </li>
            <li> I put it on both my legs, exactly as instructed; not 5 minutes later, as I was about to get into the shower, I noticed some dark spots appearing in the cream.</li>
            <li> I hurried to wash it off (almost slipping several times in the process, thanks to this stuff)</li>
            <li> When I first applied the cream, my skin started tingling and to burn a little.</li>
            <li> I may try this again for major hair removal, but next time with gloves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done this multiple times (less now though) since my first experience and each time</li>
            <li> This product may not remove every single hair if you don&#x27;t leave it on for the right amount of time, so I normally leave it on for a few extra minutes (five to ten, and my skin is never harmed by it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to anyone who really has self-esteem issues due to their hair problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to anyone who really has self-esteem issues due to their hair problems.</li>
            <li> The second time however it did not remove my hair in certain areas, (left stubble on legs) yet burned the skin completlety off in other areas</li>
            <li> and when i removed it I was left with burn marks, which are not very cute and burns so much!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another tip, if you have sensitive skin (I do) use Benadryl lotion on your skin immediately after you dry yourself off.  </li>
            <li> Anyways, it&#x27;s worth a try for hard to remove hair.</li>
            <li> Apparently, I&#x27;m not the only one who has had that problem (with the burning, anyway).</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because i dont know if the sponge will last as long as the value size bottle will.</li>
            <li> AT ALL!!!!!!    So, for all of my life I have been shaving, but, I don&#x27;t know about you, but shaving takes me such a long time, so I decided to try something different for once.</li>
            <li> This product ultimately gave me a little hope at first, but slapped me down in the end.</li>

            <li> recommends that you apply and remove their cream in a small area on your body before using it for real.  </li>
            <li> How long it took for the hair to come back.</li>
            <li> My biggest concern is how long it will last.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s left on for too long, it will burn.</li>
            <li> I know now that I don&#x27;t have to leave it on for as long next time</li>
            <li> You smear on the cream with the flat side.  </li>
            <li> It removes thick body hair pretty well.</li>
            <li> Afterwards it burns slightly but nothing major!</li>
            <li> I called up the company and also found out that not all nair products are the same and have different active and inactive ingredients.</li>
            <li> I wound up shaving right after (and of course the stupid hair came right back the next day.)</li>
            <li> The second problem with the sponging-off process is that as soon as I began rubbing the stuff off, the sponge quickly became saturated with the lather, so I had to keep rinsing and squeezing it out - difficult to do, because I was trying to keep the sponge low in the shower to prevent any of the Napalm-esque formula from splashing back at any other body parts</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too expensive, and it&#x27;s pain free.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too expensive, and it&#x27;s pain free.</li>
            <li> I have used the Nair for facial hair before, and it removed all of the hair on my chin, except the dark coarse stuff I wanted to get off.</li>
            <li> unless you have inch long hair</li>
            <li> and I did not use the product on to long.</li>
            <li> I am not a sensitive skinned person</li>
            <li> It remains to be seen how long they stay even semi-smooth.</li>
            <li> Then the hair&#x27;s grew back thicker and harder to get rid of.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, this has kept me from constantly shaving my legs and having rough hair or ingrown hair grow on my legs.</li>
            <li> I left it on the full 10 mins and used a very thin layer.</li>
            <li> really want to stress that the only faulty thing with this product, the only reason why I won&#x27;t give it a five star review... is simply because the darn sponge is just so useless.</li>

            <li> but it was a Very long time ago</li>
            <li> However, I am very careful, and have only had that happen once.  </li>
            <li> burn my legs and make them itch like crazy without really removing much hair.</li>
            <li> THAT&#x27;S DIFFICULT TO CLEAN in your tub.</li>
            <li> I was really lookng forward to this product because I am tired of shaving every day and was looking for a longer lasting alternative.</li>
            <li> Single.</li>
            <li> I have never had sensitive skin in the past.  </li>
            <li> Can only say average.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a sponge with egg-crate bumps on one side, and flat on the other.  </li>
            <li> an hour a later, once I was sure that I had all of this Satan-cream off of my body (which was difficult, because you have to apply a \\&quot;thick, even layer\\&quot;)</li>
            <li> I am a halfie, half Mexican, and half White.</li>
            <li> Whether staying dry or getting wet makes a difference.</li>
            <li> It was messy and you had to stand around naked smelling like rotten eggs for 15 minutes and then only half the hair came off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it left a little sting for me but in the end</li>
            <li> Once I started to put on my lotion, I noticed these little scratch-like things all over my legs with blood and a white pus coming out of them.</li>
            <li> I had left Veet on for 2 minutes, 5 minutes, and 10 minutes and honestly, waste of 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> THE ONE I USED WAS PINK CAPPED.)\\</li>
            <li> If it will last a few days longer than shaving</li>
            <li> I have tried nair products a few times over the last 15 years</li>
            <li> Let me start this review by saying I only give it a 1 star because 0 is not an option...applying the patch test was a waste of time as I had no issues with this.</li>
            <li> It is a few hours later</li>
            <li> Absolutely NOT.</li>
            <li> weird right?)</li>
            <li> I went to the pool with some friends the 5th day after, thinking that the rash had died down enough &amp; was getting less bothersome.</li>
            <li> however the next day i noticed some serious acne on my butt and back.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions exactly as stated, and after the max amount of time on, it itched very badly, but didn&#x27;t remove that much hair, especially not around my knees.</li>
            <li> if all looks well I&#x27;ll use it on the rest of my arms and the other areas as well.</li>
            <li> Over the past 3 years, this is my third attempt at a Nair product.  </li>
            <li> I have found that other creams still leave stray hairs and hairs on the feet.</li>
            <li> Then I did the other leg.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;DO NOT USE THIS ON YOUR FACE if you are using glycolic products (or any other exfoliating products).  </li>
            <li> Other than that, Nair Shower Power Max has worked miracles for me.</li>
            <li> Other than that, Nair Shower Power Max has worked miracles for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Nair products</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the past four years and, unless I have my hair removed permanently, do not plan to go back to the razor anytime soon.</li>
            <li> Areas that I was CERTAIN that I had spread enough product on proved me wrong by stubbornly retaining hair!</li>
            <li> It was the first and only time I had a chemical burn, and I worked as a lab technician for two years and took various lab classes that used irritating chemicals, but I had never had such a bad experience as when I used this</li>
            <li> I did it EXACTLY as it described on the outside, and my skin reacted badly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not able to wear a long sleeve shirt without the pain on my arms.</li>
            <li> My underarms got extremely irritated and red, and my legs still itch like mad several hours later.</li>
            <li> so I had wooly mammoth winter legs) but probably not worth the time for just a bit of stubble.</li>
            <li> i also saw the number of negative reviews on amazon after buying the product and wished i saw them prior to the purchase.</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY THICK AND COARSE HAIR.</li>
            <li> I said, \\&quot;I hate Nair\\&quot; out loud when I first saw the damage.    </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m talking my thick coarse hair,</li>
            <li> I bought the max because I&#x27;ve found regular Nair just doesn&#x27;t handle my amount of thick hair.</li>
            <li> THUMBS DOWN</li>
            <li> This stuff got rid of all my body hair, even &#x27;down there&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a product like this before, I wasn&#x27;t alarmed by the slight tingling on my knees.  </li>
            <li> I bought this item thinking that it would be easier than shaving and would take less time.</li>
            <li> i waited about 1 week to 1 and a half weeks and decided to use it again.</li>
            <li> If you notice a slight itching or burning of our skin, use soap and remove the product.  </li>
            <li> Immediately after applying, I felt a slight burning sensation, but it was negligible.</li>
            <li> but I get out of the shower and look at my leg and its like little cut marks that you get when you fall down in gravel</li>
            <li> stuff MAKES A MESS</li>
            <li> Or worse, I once had a thinner skin on my legs due to dryness and scratching and it caused an open wound.</li>
            <li> The sponge and the pump make things less messy.  </li>
            <li> Throughout the years I&#x27;ve always dealt with thick, coarse and excessive hair.</li>
            <li> After getting home and putting it on for as long as the time requested, i started to use the weird sponge thing to get it off, big mistake.</li>
            <li> Nails are made of the same stuff as hair and when I was done, I had to trim all my fingernails down to stubs because the tips had become so thin and brittle from exposure to the cream.</li>
            <li> , they burn, they hurt, and little to no hair came off.</li>
            <li> , they burn, they hurt, and little to no hair came off.</li>
            <li> There was a little bit of warming sensation but you are using chemicals, you can&#x27;t expect to feel nothing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little worried about how well it will work on my coarser bikini area</li>
            <li> it actually does: not remove hair, burns your body in every place it touches, and burns away your will to live, leaving you in a still-hairy, shocked state of terror and disgust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I got over it, because it is worth it to not have to \\&quot;spread &#x27;em\\&quot; and experience a painful Brazilian wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money &amp; don&#x27;t risk the reaction.</li>
            <li> Avoid pools for a few days after trying it.</li>
            <li> Looks like another waste of money.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.  </li>
            <li> I do use a heavily smelling soap after product is off in order not to smell like the nair product.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had read reviews before burning $10 at Rite-Aid on this smelly, ineffective, messy junk.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money on this.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> was in Wally-World a few days ago and while looking through the shaving aisle, saw this product.</li>
            <li> I do have a few stragglers which probably came from an uneven application, but I will reapply the nair again in a few days.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll end up using half the bottle for both legs!  </li>
            <li> As I said before, I use it on other delicate areas with no troubles, but my microdermabrased and exfoliated skin couldn&#x27;t handle it.</li>
            <li> And pretty bad ones at that.</li>
            <li> It doesnt have to be real thick just enough to cover the hairs.  </li>
            <li> i use this on my underarms and left them red and painful (like a sunburn)</li>
            <li> its a little hard for me to believe people start bleeding after 4 mins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t have super-sensitive skin, I thought to myself, \\&quot;Aw, that&#x27;s a waste of time!  </li>
            <li> , I was anxious to try something that made it to where I didn&#x27;t have to shave every.</li>
            <li> and I have used nair products in the past without incident</li>
            <li> and i was never satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Then bathe as usual.  </li>
            <li> I have had razor burn in the past shaving my arms, so I decided to try this.</li>
            <li> After no more than 4 minutes on my legs, they started stinging and spots of blood appeared - hair is still there, but I have chemical burns in places.  </li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> Product was on some areas for too long because it is very difficult to apply, and application took a long time.</li>
            <li> That led me to press hard with the sponge to try to remove the hair, which caused burning pain; the sponge ripped to shreds by the time I was done; and the HAIR STILL DIDN&#x27;T COME OFF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed that a lot of the product went into the sponge and it was hard to get an \\&quot;even, thick layer\\&quot; like the instructions told me to.</li>
            <li> Its just this product sucks.</li>
            <li> but I was too late.</li>
            <li> I use this at least once or twice a month.</li>
            <li> With all of the negative reviews, it should frankly be taken off the shelves.</li>
            <li> but I absolutely hate shaving as my hair grows ridiculously fast.</li>
            <li> but I have thick leg hair</li>
            <li> I hate using high amounts of chemicals.</li>
            <li> I hate using high amounts of chemicals.</li>
            <li> Frankly, I am extremely unsatisfied to very annoyed.</li>
            <li> After getting in the shower, I at first used the provided sponge to remove the product, but that was very painful, so I opted for a wash</li>
            <li> and now look and feel like I just got seriously sunburned.  </li>
            <li> After I tried the product the second time, i got horrible cystic acne on my back and pimples on my butt and thighs.</li>
            <li> Not only did it badly burn me, but it did not remover the hair like it said it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;User</li>
            <li> I waited a few minutes, feeling increasingly uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> but they are painful and red.  </li>
            <li> A LITTLE blood from the underarms and legs, but by far worst decision was using it on my underarms.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE blood from the underarms and legs, but by far worst decision was using it on my underarms.</li>
            <li> My legs were hurting so bad I couldn&#x27;t even wear long pants or use a blanket without it hurting.</li>
            <li> dont use this it is dangerous and not worth it.</li>
            <li> If you skip the smelly soap step then you will smell the nair until your next shower :(      </li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t even have thick leg hair!  </li>
            <li> I was left very uncomfortable and angry</li>
            <li> Itched worse than poison ivy.</li>
            <li> After applying a thin coat to my legs</li>
            <li> Leaves a bit of hair behind have to apply and reapply about 3 times before all hair is removed</li>
            <li> Works really well but smells terrible when you get in the shower</li>
            <li> I was confused for a moment, then realized it was blood.</li>
            <li> And to make matters worse, none of the hair had come off.</li>
            <li> The product does work but it still leaves behind some hair.</li>
            <li> This is ridiculous!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had reactions to depilatories in the past - at worst, just some minor irritation that went away after a couple of hours -</li>
            <li> It burned so incredibly bad, my skin was raw for a week.</li>
            <li> I was completely wrong.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t do anything wrong</li>
            <li> I actually used this product about four years ago, but I still remember what a horrible experience it was.</li>
            <li> It does a terrible job of applying the product and removing the product because it is not abrasive enough.</li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> I went in to this skeptically.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, by the time I was done applying it, the damage had been done.</li>
            <li> It was so uncomfortable that the slightest touch of anything against my legs afterwards would elicit stinging, distracting pain.</li>
            <li> I thought I had a bad experience, then I talked with my friends about it; one of them wanted to go to the hospital because she was so uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It was rather disappointing.</li>
            <li> It was rather disappointing.</li>
            <li> Yes, it stinks, like all hair-removal creams that I have found.  </li>
            <li> this terrible product left behind was about six or seven bleeding, raised blotches on both legs that stung horribly.</li>
            <li> My legs weren&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> My legs weren&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> and they stung bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had bad experience with hair removal creams, they never work for me until I purchased this.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, my skin was bleeding after using this and it burned really badly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never worked with a chemical that smelled as badly as this product, and it had a toxic effect on me.</li>
            <li> and it gave me a  bad rash for 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> The burning feeling became so bad I had to get the cream off</li>
            <li> This hair remover was painful for my daughter and is frightened to use it again.  </li>
            <li> and although we&#x27;re always disappointed w/ this stuff...</li>
            <li> It burned like crap and started to stink badly.</li>
            <li> Let me start off that I hate to buy something &amp; end up throwing it away &amp; wasting it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate the sponge tho.</li>
            <li> If you are like me you hate shaving during winter</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, I hate shaving.</li>
            <li> My underarms got the worst of it</li>
            <li> My underarms got the worst of it</li>
            <li> It smells awful -</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst purchases I have ever made.</li>
            <li> Worst thing I have ever exposed my skin to.</li>
            <li> I followed all the instructions to a T, and still had horrible repercussions.</li>
            <li> I know that a severe allergic reaction does not happen to everybody, but just beware of this terrible product, I&#x27;m never using it again.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the brief review.&lt;br /&gt;What you think this product will do: remove hair from your legs.&lt;br /&gt;What it actually does: not remove hair, burns your body in every place it touches, and burns away your will to live, leaving you in a still-hairy, shocked state of terror and disgust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And here&#x27;s the longer version.&lt;br /&gt;Nair recommends that you apply and remove their cream in a small area on your body before using it for real.  Since I don&#x27;t have super-sensitive skin, I thought to myself, \\&quot;Aw, that&#x27;s a waste of time!  I&#x27;ll be fine.\\&quot;  This was an unwise decision.  So, I put the stuff on outside the shower, as per the instructions.  I&#x27;ve never used a product like this before, I wasn&#x27;t alarmed by the slight tingling on my knees.  I figured that was normal.  I got into the shower.  I waited a few minutes, feeling increasingly uncomfortable.  My skin was beginning to burn.  Then I started in with that tiny sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first problem I encountered was that the cream smells like horse piss, which added to the unpleasantness of the experience.  The second problem with the sponging-off process is that as soon as I began rubbing the stuff off, the sponge quickly became saturated with the lather, so I had to keep rinsing and squeezing it out - difficult to do, because I was trying to keep the sponge low in the shower to prevent any of the Napalm-esque formula from splashing back at any other body parts (I shudder to think of the havoc this could wreak on one&#x27;s.. unmentionables).  The third problem is that using a piece of glorified sandpaper on legs that already feel like they&#x27;re been torched causes a kind of agony that I can&#x27;t express without stringing together half a dozen curse words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Half an hour a later, once I was sure that I had all of this Satan-cream off of my body (which was difficult, because you have to apply a \\&quot;thick, even layer\\&quot;), I got out of the shower.  It was easier, then, to see the enormous splotches that had formed on my legs.I&#x27;m not talking quarter-sized.  It looked (and felt!) like someone had thrown acid on my legs from three feet away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adding insult to (literal) injury, there were exactly zero fewer hairs on my body after I&#x27;d finished the agonizing process.  And I don&#x27;t even have thick leg hair!  Why, Nair, WHY?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to masochists.  For everyone else: steer clear.</li>
            <li> Let me start off that I hate to buy something &amp; end up throwing it away &amp; wasting it. Well, I gladly threw this out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried in on my legs. It didn&#x27;t remove any of the hair. My lower legs tends to be coarser, but my thighs are very fine. It didn&#x27;t remove either. Instead, it left my legs in an itching, red, bumpy rage. Itched worse than poison ivy. Lotions and anti itch creams did nothing to stop it, not even CalAGel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the rash it gave me, I couldn&#x27;t shave either for several days because the shave cream would just burn. I went to the pool with some friends the 5th day after, thinking that the rash had died down enough &amp; was getting less bothersome. The second I hit the water it started all over again. I didn&#x27;t even think about the fact that chemicals from the nair would only be amplified by the pool chemicals and cause further reaction (even 5 days later).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice? Don&#x27;t waste your money &amp; don&#x27;t risk the reaction. If you have already bought it, return it. If you used it once &amp; want to try  again, don&#x27;t. Avoid pools for a few days after trying it. This product just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I used the product as directed on my legs and removed the product when I could remove a couple hairs by gently scraping with my fingernail (after 8 minutes).  Now I have blisters on my legs.  I have never had sensitive skin in the past.  Do not use this product.</li>
            <li> I tried this in the shower and it came off, just like soap.  I don&#x27;t know how the other versions work, but this one worked really well OUT OF THE SHOWER.  If you are using one that works good right now, don&#x27;t buy this one because of the shower hoax.  My legs to feel really smooth and I did use it on my belly button and underarms.  My under arms did burn for like 24 hours when they came into contact with soap and legs and underarms do feel softer and look nicer then when I use my razor.  BUT IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK IN THE SHOWER!  I have very very course hair and it worked in about 5 minutes for me.  I did follow the directions and use the sponge to put the cream on and used it in a circular motion to wipe it off.  I even used the sponge in a circular motion in the shower and then I pumped some liquid soap ( on the sponge) and washed my legs and arm pits off with it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this item thinking that it would be easier than shaving and would take less time. I was completely wrong. I did EXACTLY what the directions said to do and I still have massive amounts of hair left on my legs and knees. This does not work please do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> i use this on my underarms and left them red and painful (like a sunburn) so i didnt use it again. the first time you use this on your legs it works. it left a little sting for me but in the end i thought i had great results and it left me skin soft and mostly hair free. i waited about 1 week to 1 and a half weeks and decided to use it again. the product literally ate my skin. the chemicals took out the top layer of skin on most of my leg and my fingers i was using the product with. i had to go to the ER and they told me the chemicals caused my skin to burn off. unless you have inch long hair the product will eventually cause this to happen to your skin. dont use this it is dangerous and not worth it.</li>
            <li> Junk,horrible product. All this did was burn my legs and make them itch like crazy without really removing much hair. Avoid this at all cost. The only way to rid your self of unwanted hair is with a razor or wax. Follow the lead of most women.They have been doing this practically their whole lives. All of the women I know advised me not to do this, but I ingored them and paid the price</li>
            <li> ***UPDATE! UPDATE! UPDATE!*** Let me start off with a description. I am a halfie, half Mexican, and half White. I have EXTREMELY THICK AND COARSE HAIR. I am NOT kidding when I say this. (I went to the salon to get my hair thinned, three weeks later it was back to it&#x27;s regular thickness.) I had a kid and for some people hair growth is huge while pregnant, mine went into remission (except for the hair on my head...weird right?) Anyways, after having a kid, my body decided to produce more leg and underarm hair. Shoot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I was anxious to try something that made it to where I didn&#x27;t have to shave every. Single. Day. I tried Veet and it didn&#x27;t work at all. I had left Veet on for 2 minutes, 5 minutes, and 10 minutes and honestly, waste of 10 minutes. I wound up shaving right after (and of course the stupid hair came right back the next day.) So I decided, \\&quot;What the Hell. Let&#x27;s try Nair Shower Power Max (I DID NOT USE THE PURPLE CAPPED ONE. THE ONE I USED WAS PINK CAPPED.)\\&quot; I made an escape to the bathroom and applied generously. I waited MAYBE 2-3 minutes before I hopped in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing I noticed? Despite NOT having my legs in direct contact with the shower head water (it trickled from my upper torso, down) as per the bottle, the stuff was coming right off. Well Damn. Looks like another waste of money. Or, so I had thought. I used the sponge and to my surprise the hair was coming right off. Granted, it was splotchy (likely because the water ruined it) but as of now, my legs have never felt more smooth. When I have to use it again, I&#x27;m going to stay out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WILL update this with three things: 1. How long it took for the hair to come back. 2. Whether staying dry or getting wet makes a difference. 3. Whether I feel any discomfort or allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE! UPDATE! UPDATE!***&lt;br /&gt;Time for the update. So, last I wrote this was 2 days ago. Day 1 no hair, but day 2 was about the same amount as I normally get, however, it was in patches (likely because the water washing away some of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, I used it on my underarms, my legs, and around my groin. I let it sit for about 4-6 minutes OUTSIDE THE SHOWER. Regrettably. My underarms got the worst of it, they burn, they hurt, and little to no hair came off. A LITTLE blood from the underarms and legs, but by far worst decision was using it on my underarms. My legs weren&#x27;t too bad. I got more hair off than first encounter, but STILL had to use a razor, albeit a moderate to lesser extent than before. Groin area, probably the best place to have used it. I didn&#x27;t put a lot on, but the hair was falling off, THANKFULLY. Although, it didn&#x27;t do as good a job as I&#x27;d hoped (considering I&#x27;ve almost gone through 1/3 of the bottle and only gotten moderate results for $9. I&#x27;ve downgraded my rating to a 2.5-3 star. This product ultimately gave me a little hope at first, but slapped me down in the end. It was rather disappointing. I hope they come up with a more natural way to rid yourself of hair quick and easy. I hate using high amounts of chemicals. In any case, this product is mediocre at best. My legs are still itchy even after application of two types of lotions. What a bummer!get, however, it was in patches (likely because the water washing away some of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, I used it on my underarms, my legs, and around my groin.

            <li> This hair remover was painful for my daughter and is frightened to use it again.  She has very sensitive skin though and probably OK if you havent.  Can only say average.</li>
            <li> I just bought this product today because after reading the ingredients on both the nair and Veet almost all of the ingredients were the same. I bought the Nair Max because I have very course hair. I have used Nair before but it was a Very long time ago but I absolutely hate shaving as my hair grows ridiculously fast. I plan to use it on my bikin area, arms and lower tummy area. I&#x27;m not planning on using it on my legs cuz I think I would need a miracle cream. I&#x27;ve used nads and buffing with the sand paper pads which work well on my arms but it&#x27;s a lot of work on areas that have creases, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t give a full review yet cuz I only did a test spot first on my wrist area. I&#x27;m not stupid, I know 2-3 mins is not going to work on me. I left it on the full 10 mins and used a very thin layer. I noticed towards the end of the 10 mins the hairs looked like they were shriveling up so I figured it was ready. I used warm water and the sponge in small circular motions and it got everything off. My skin feels just as smooth as when I use the buffing pads. There was a little bit of warming sensation but you are using chemicals, you can&#x27;t expect to feel nothing. its a little hard for me to believe people start bleeding after 4 mins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far it&#x27;s worked great. Tomorrow if all looks well I&#x27;ll use it on the rest of my arms and the other areas as well. I&#x27;m a little worried about how well it will work on my coarser bikini area but we&#x27;ll see. My biggest concern is how long it will last. If it will last a few days longer than shaving it&#x27;ll be worth it to me.</li>
            <li> This product burned my skin off. The first time I used it it worked pretty good left les very smooth. The second time however it did not remove my hair in certain areas, (left stubble on legs) yet burned the skin completlety off in other areas and I did not use the product on to long. THUMBS DOWN and I have used nair products in the past without incident</li>
            <li> I tend to avoid depilatories as a rule on myself, as I have found that, on my upper body, they work, but, for whatever reason, not one has worked on my legs, and I, more often than not, have the same irritation issue on my legs as most previous reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;That said, for body use, this works, and well. It removes thick body hair pretty well. Now, keep in mind, this is a depilatory. You are putting chemicals on your skin to open your pores and take the hair away. It&#x27;s gonna burn, or it&#x27;s not going to work, those are pretty much your only options if you don&#x27;t want to shave, pluck or wax it away.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.  It says it \\&quot;even works on coarse hair,\\&quot; which is a complete lie.  I used this on my legs and bikini area.  Not one hair was removed.  I put it on as instructed, but two minutes short.  It was as if nothing happened.  I imagined it would all wash away.  So I said, ok I won&#x27;t give up on the product just yet.  The next day i tried it again but for the extra two minutes as instructed.  No hair was washed away in my bikini area.  It started stinging and i had no idea why.  Later I realized it was burning my skin.  There were dabs of blood, and now I have red scars.  I said, \\&quot;I hate Nair\\&quot; out loud when I first saw the damage.    I know there used to be those \\&quot;who wears short shorts\\&quot; ads in the 70s.  My mom used to talk about &#x27;em.  I&#x27;m 24.  My question is... How has Nair managed to stay in business all of these years???  None of their products work.  Over the past 3 years, this is my third attempt at a Nair product.  I read \\&quot;Nair MAX\\&quot; and \\&quot;even for coarse hair\\&quot; and was fooled again.  I think that they stay in business, riding on our hope to never have to shave again...  and although we&#x27;re always disappointed w/ this stuff... we keep hoping the next Nair product will actually work.</li>
            <li> First let me say that I normally do not shave, wax or exfoliate my legs.  I have coarse hair and after much debate I decided to try this product.  I followed the directions exactly and I was very pleased.  After applying a thin coat to my legs I stepped into the shower.  As the directions stated, I did not let the shower spray hit my legs directly, actually I turned the shower head against the curtain.  I did drizzle some water on my legs and found that the cream stayed put.  I used the opposite side of the sponge in a circular motion and removed most of the hairs.  I do have a few stragglers which probably came from an uneven application, but I will reapply the nair again in a few days.  I dont think it should be applied again before that because im pretty sure it will cause irritation.  Overall I am very pleased with this product as it removed 98% of the hairs on my leg, even with me not truly knowing what i was doing.  I have tried nair products a few times over the last 15 years and i was never satisfied.  This product really exceeded my expectations.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because i dont know if the sponge will last as long as the value size bottle will. I plan on adding this to my regular routine.</li>
            <li> i had seen the commercials for this and wanted to try it. I dont shave my legs i wax them but shave my underarms. On the bottle it says for your body. I used this and when i took it off no hair had come off and i had huge red marks on my skin and they stung bad. I didn&#x27;t do anything wrong i fallowed the instructions. Its just this product sucks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product three times.  Have not had the severe reactions others have mentioned.  And it does remove hair.  But, it takes longer &amp; is more trouble than just shaving.  Razors have improved so much over the years that I can shave both legs in much less time than this goop &amp; get better results.</li>
            <li> This works like a charm. I suggest you do not leave it on pass 7 minutes if your skin is sensitive. It still has a strong smell, but nothing soap and water cannot handle</li>
            <li> My wife uses this stuff. It works wonderfully well. I appreciate the effort that she takes to look and feel beautiful for me. From a man&#x27;s point of view . . . this stuff is great. She says that she has had no adverse effects from the use of this product using it on a weekly basis. She uses it not in the shower, but sitting before the bathroom sink. She says that a 10 minute application is sufficient time for hair removal before wiping/rinsing the product off.</li>
            <li> 1st let me say that I used this product EXACTLY how the directions said and it worked perfectly.  I have found that other creams still leave stray hairs and hairs on the feet. This doesn&#x27;t on me.  It is a bit pricey but I have also found that I go longer between uses.  I start to get stubbles on day 7 or 8. Not too smelly either.  I do use a heavily smelling soap after product is off in order not to smell like the nair product.  This works well for the odor. If you skip the smelly soap step then you will smell the nair until your next shower :(      The only flaw.....In order for you to get good coverage you&#x27;ll end up using half the bottle for both legs!  It looks like a lot because it&#x27;s the biggest nair product on the shelf but don&#x27;t let that fool you!  It is good for 2 uses maybe you could get it to last 3 uses if you only do your lower legs.  I do the entire leg so maybe thats why I am only getting 2 uses. Anyways, it&#x27;s worth a try for hard to remove hair.</li>
            <li> Very happy with product... Use it on my 11 year old... It came off like magic ...we left it on for 4 minutes and all of her hair came off...</li>
            <li> Leaves a bit of hair behind have to apply and reapply about 3 times before all hair is removed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had bad experience with hair removal creams, they never work for me until I purchased this. It&#x27;s effective at removing hair but its really, really strong. If it&#x27;s left on for too long, it will burn. I am african american so I have really coarse hair. This stuff got rid of all my body hair, even &#x27;down there&#x27;. I know now that I don&#x27;t have to leave it on for as long next time but if it burns me like it did the first time, I won&#x27;t use it again.</li>
            <li> This was the first depilatory I ever used and it turned me off of them forever. I actually used this product about four years ago, but I still remember what a horrible experience it was. It was the first and only time I had a chemical burn, and I worked as a lab technician for two years and took various lab classes that used irritating chemicals, but I had never had such a bad experience as when I used this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually DID patch test this product on a small part of my leg, and it seemed fine. The depilatory melted the hairs off my leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when I used this for my bikini area, I followed the instructions step by step. Nevertheless, my skin was bleeding after using this and it burned really badly. I only applied it to my hair and not my skin, but I was in agony. The egg crate sponge they included made it so much worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product should not even be in the market. It smells awful - I&#x27;ve never worked with a chemical that smelled as badly as this product, and it had a toxic effect on me. It doesn&#x27;t even remove all the hair, as it purports to do.</li>
            <li> I have tried Nair for Men and it did not work. It was messy and you had to stand around naked smelling like rotten eggs for 15 minutes and then only half the hair came off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is fast.  Applying it with the sponge was easy.  You simply paint the stuff on you.  It doesnt have to be real thick just enough to cover the hairs.  The sponge and the pump make things less messy.  DO NOT RUB THIS STUFF IN JUST PAINT IT ON. I think the people who have had this stuff burn them probably rubbed it in, just smooth light paint strokes.  I left it on for about 1 more minute after doing both legs (meaning the first leg had already had two minutes and I noticed the hair was already shriveled and ready to come off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hoped into the shower, placing the leg I did first under the shower water and lightly using the bumpy side of the sponge began rubbing the hair off.  It come off in huge clumps and if you keep buffing our skin with it all the hair is removed.  Then I did the other leg.  Same thing.  If you notice a slight itching or burning of our skin, use soap and remove the product.  Just because you are rinsing the hair off your body does not mean the product still is not on your skin so remove it with soap and a wash cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another tip, if you have sensitive skin (I do) use Benadryl lotion on your skin immediately after you dry yourself off.  Just rub it in and it will prevent any redness or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There maybe a few straggling hairs left, wait a couple hours to clean those up.  That way you do not irritate the skin any further.  I would also suggest you do not use this product more than once a week. Also if you want to try this product make sure you wait a few days or a week from your last shave.  I also do not recommend exfoliating before using this product.  The product will do the exfoliating for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a good product.  It did what it said it would, even on course male body hair.</li>
            <li> Very strong smell and it gave me a  bad rash for 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> I wish I had read reviews before burning $10 at Rite-Aid on this smelly, ineffective, messy junk. Not only all of that, but THE ENTIRE BOTTLE WASN&#x27;T ENOUGH to cover all of my hair! I&#x27;m left with hair on some areas because there was no product left to cover them. Areas that I was CERTAIN that I had spread enough product on proved me wrong by stubbornly retaining hair! Product was on some areas for too long because it is very difficult to apply, and application took a long time. As it turned out, only the areas that started burning (the first areas I covered) had any effective hair removal. (Guess which area that had coarse hair burned like crazy yet didn&#x27;t have the hair effectively removed? Yup - that area.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;specially designed\\&quot; sponge is just the cheapest foam they could find. It does a terrible job of applying the product and removing the product because it is not abrasive enough. That led me to press hard with the sponge to try to remove the hair, which caused burning pain; the sponge ripped to shreds by the time I was done; and the HAIR STILL DIDN&#x27;T COME OFF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff MAKES A MESS THAT&#x27;S DIFFICULT TO CLEAN in your tub. Your hair-catch will be full of semi-dissolved hair; it&#x27;s super gross and it takes some scrubbing to clean. There will also be bits of semi-dissolved hair all over your tub, and you will have to scrub the tub thoroughly to get rid of the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the last straw - I am now going to man up and just wax my hair. This is ridiculous!</li>
            <li> I agree with AnimeChrisy - I use this only in the bikini area with Brazilian Wax results.  I am baby-smooth afterward.  Ladies, make sure not to get it inside your private parts, as it will burn.  However, I am very careful, and have only had that happen once.  I have never found a cream that works well on my legs, so I haven&#x27;t even bothered using the Shower Formula Nair as it is intended.  This bottle contains many Brazilian \\&quot;waxes\\&quot; - you will not run out very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a sponge with egg-crate bumps on one side, and flat on the other.  You smear on the cream with the flat side.  Around sensitive areas, I use fingers rather than the sponge.  I wait one minute (sometimes 1.5 minutes), then get in the shower and make an effort not to stand directly under the water.  I wash my hair and wrap it up in conditioner, then I remove the cream with the bumpy side of the sponge.  Never, ever scrub, because it will burn.  Wipe in one direction, each time rinsing the sponge, until you remove most all of cream.  Then bathe as usual.  Yes, it stinks, like all hair-removal creams that I have found.  But I got over it, because it is worth it to not have to \\&quot;spread &#x27;em\\&quot; and experience a painful Brazilian wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT USE THIS ON YOUR FACE if you are using glycolic products (or any other exfoliating products).  I burned myself.  As I said before, I use it on other delicate areas with no troubles, but my microdermabrased and exfoliated skin couldn&#x27;t handle it.</li>
            <li> It may be a good product if you leave it on long enough, i left it on for like two mins and it took off the majority just for a test run. I absolutely hate the sponge tho. I think people with really sensitive skin will get a reaction out of almost anything so don&#x27;t assume your body is like anyone else&#x27;s. Overall I&#x27;m okay with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Throughout the years I&#x27;ve always dealt with thick, coarse and excessive hair. This is all thanks to the fact that I deal with PCOS. As a female, of course it had caused me to deal with self-esteem issues as well as the feeling to just never want to get near people, in fear of them judging me for how hairy my arms or my legs would look. After purchasing Nair, for at least the third time now: I finally feel confident in giving a review on this wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nair Shower Power Max works just as directed on the bottle. It&#x27;s not hard to apply it, although the sponge that comes along with hair remover is quite flimsy: it&#x27;s still managable. I know it says not to touch it with your fingers, but if you&#x27;re not afraid (I&#x27;ve done this a couple of times, fingers are still perfectly fine sometimes just left with the scent) you can spread it easier that way. Just be sure you rinse off any extra once you&#x27;ve finished applying the amount to your desired area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once it comes time to wash off the formula, and you&#x27;re not feeling the sponge because let&#x27;s be honest: it just collects all the hair and breaks apart easily. I&#x27;d suggest investing in maybe a hand towel or a shower pouf/loofah (since you can use this in the shower, why not?) to scrub off the hair and the Nair as well. I&#x27;ve done this multiple times (less now though) since my first experience and each time, I find the hairs on my legs take a longer period to grow. I was used to shaving maybe two times a week, or every other week if I was lucky. But with Nair, I was apply to go three or even four weeks until the stubble on my legs became noticeable. And I&#x27;m talking my thick coarse hair, is just slowly growing back which is absolutely amazing. This product may not remove every single hair if you don&#x27;t leave it on for the right amount of time, so I normally leave it on for a few extra minutes (five to ten, and my skin is never harmed by it. Only try this at your own risk!) After removing the Nair, your skin feels completely smooth and it&#x27;s left smelling fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really want to stress that the only faulty thing with this product, the only reason why I won&#x27;t give it a five star review... is simply because the darn sponge is just so useless. I wish they could&#x27;ve made it with better material, but it is what it is. Other than that, Nair Shower Power Max has worked miracles for me. It&#x27;s not too expensive, and it&#x27;s pain free. Hell I&#x27;ve fallen in love with the product so much, that if I really need it to prepare for an event I just hit up a local pharmacy and purchase it there (a couple of dollars more but it&#x27;s worth every cent.) I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to anyone who really has self-esteem issues due to their hair problems. Or those who just can&#x27;t stand the excess body hair. Once you try it, I promise you&#x27;ll run around ask all your friends and family to touch your smooth legs, arms or wherever it is you&#x27;ve used Nair Shower Power Max on! :-)eels completely smooth and it&#x27;s left smelling fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really want to stress that the only faulty thing with this product, the only reason why I won&#x27;t give it a five star review... is simply because the darn sponge is just so useless.

            <li> Works really well but smells terrible when you get in the shower</li>
            <li> Great for the bikini line,</li>
            <li> I bought this product off of a recommendation of a friend (she had no problem using it, so I thought hey, why not). This is one of the worst purchases I have ever made. I followed the instructions to a T, and when I got out of the shower all of my leg hair was still intact. Now, I must say that I hadn&#x27;t shaved in about two weeks, so there was plenty of hair for it to remove. Nothing. I also used it along my bikini line, and the amount of pain I experienced was not worth it. It burned so incredibly bad, my skin was raw for a week. I have the sensitive version as well, and it did nothing. DO NOT BUY. Worst thing I have ever exposed my skin to.</li>
            <li> It works great last longer than shaving now u love showing my legs</li>
            <li> You can put this on for a minute and then get in the shower.  You then take it off at the end of your shower.  Very convenient for the busy people out there!</li>
            <li> I have used this once, and regretted it as soon as I applied it. I followed all the instructions to a T, and still had horrible repercussions. When I first applied the cream, my skin started tingling and to burn a little. My thought process was alright, maybe this is it sinking in and doing it&#x27;s job, right? Wrong. I started using the remover sponge my legs were hairless, I&#x27;ll give it that, but I was left with horribly red skin, bumps and it burned for hours after I removed the product. My legs were hurting so bad I couldn&#x27;t even wear long pants or use a blanket without it hurting. Even though have a high level of a pain thresh hold, I was in pain. It was like everything I did aggravated it in someway. The bumps lasted for three or so days, the pain stayed for a couple hours and the burning stayed for the rest of the day. I thought I had a bad experience, then I talked with my friends about it; one of them wanted to go to the hospital because she was so uncomfortable. I was left very uncomfortable and angry I wasted my money on this. Save yourself by not buying this.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to remove the hair on my arms. I have had razor burn in the past shaving my arms, so I decided to try this. I did it EXACTLY as it described on the outside, and my skin reacted badly. I have spots ALL over my arms, and they constantly burn. I&#x27;m not able to wear a long sleeve shirt without the pain on my arms. This is the third time I have tried it, and each time is the same. Not only does it burn, however, but it didn&#x27;t remove all of the hair! I had to spend  couple of hours plucking the rest of the hairs out of my arm. Although the cream did make the plucking painless, it was a hassle all the way around. I do not recommend this product to anyone trying to remove hair from their arms.</li>
            <li> OUCH! Nair hair remover left me with a rash that made my skin look like it was about to bleed. I did NOT use it for longer than directed. Do not use if you have sensitive skin. I should have known anything that could disolve my hair was too good to be true. Hair is gone but ouch!</li>
            <li> I followed instructions to the letter, had it on for the minimum amount of time - 3 minutes- and now look and feel like I just got seriously sunburned.  I&#x27;ve very glad I didn&#x27;t leave this on longer, or I really might have had to take it to the hospital.  I took two showers, and got the last of it off with a washcloth, and it still hurts, rather a lot.  I also smell, even after very thoroughly washing off.  I&#x27;ll give em this though, the hair is off, along with what appears to be the top layer or two of skin.  I now look like a sunburned Alaskan...in November...right before a date tonight.  Frankly, I am extremely unsatisfied to very annoyed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been trying to find a depilatory that would actually work on thick/course hair and I saw that this supposedly did, so I decided to give it a try. I wish I had looked for reviews before trying this. I&#x27;ve never had reactions to depilatories in the past - at worst, just some minor irritation that went away after a couple of hours - but I have sensitive skin, so I did the patch test as it instructed (did it for 10 minutes, on the underside of my arm, as that&#x27;s the most sensitive area and I wasn&#x27;t planning on using this on my arms; good thing, too). No problems. But apparently a small section wasn&#x27;t a good enough indication.     I put it on both my legs, exactly as instructed; not 5 minutes later, as I was about to get into the shower, I noticed some dark spots appearing in the cream. I was confused for a moment, then realized it was blood. I hurried to wash it off (almost slipping several times in the process, thanks to this stuff) but I was too late. My legs were already burned. And to make matters worse, none of the hair had come off. Apparently, I&#x27;m not the only one who has had that problem (with the burning, anyway). How did this stuff make it to the market?     Don&#x27;t waste your money. This stuff doesn&#x27;t work the way it says it does and it will probably just end up burning your skin.</li>
            <li> Let me start this review by saying I only give it a 1 star because 0 is not an option...applying the patch test was a waste of time as I had no issues with this. I applied the cream to my legs first. Working my way up to the bikini area and applying to the under arms. At first everything appeared to be going well it wasn&#x27;t until I started to work on the lower second leg that the burning sensation kicked in. As I am using this sponge to get this stuff off, I get it in an area you do not want to get it in. I am left with hairy burning legs and who ha not to mention my underarms feel razorburnt. I am not a sensitive skinned person so I am left in questions as to how some sensitive skin people can use this with no reaction. Thanks for NOTHING Nair</li>
            <li> This product has a lot of inorganic ingredients, so I would advise against getting it unless you want to toxify your skin.</li>
            <li> If you are like me you hate shaving during winter I never shaved and my hair would literally be like a mans! I know it&#x27;s gross! I went in to this skeptically.  It works amazing my legs are even smoother than when I shave for an entire hour.  Of course it smells but I got a clean shave in 3 minutes so it is worth it! Afterwards it burns slightly but nothing major! Everyone should definitely use it my full recommendation!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 20yo girl, first real time using a product like this (I&#x27;m a shaving purist).     I followed the instructions exactly as stated, and after the max amount of time on, it itched very badly, but didn&#x27;t remove that much hair, especially not around my knees. My legs feel like they would about 12 hours after a fresh shave. My underarms got extremely irritated and red, and my legs still itch like mad several hours later. It remains to be seen how long they stay even semi-smooth. Save your money and just invest in a few good razors and shave gel instead.</li>
            <li> WARNING::::: DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT AT ALL!!!!!!    So, for all of my life I have been shaving, but, I don&#x27;t know about you, but shaving takes me such a long time, so I decided to try something different for once. I went to Walgreens and scanned the hair removal aisle, and came upon a bunch of Nair products. Since I hadn&#x27;t shaved in a few days, I decided to go ahead and get the more expensive one ( but the one that seemed to take the most hair away ), Nair: Shower Power Max. After getting home and putting it on for as long as the time requested, i started to use the weird sponge thing to get it off, big mistake. Once I started rubbing, I started to feel like I was in hell. It burned like crap and started to stink badly. Finally, I got it all off, and stepped out of the shower, still burning and itching. Once I started to put on my lotion, I noticed these little scratch-like things all over my legs with blood and a white pus coming out of them. It is a few hours later and I&#x27;m still burning, and stuff is still coming out of them, to be honest, they kind of look like 2nd degree burns actually. I know that a severe allergic reaction does not happen to everybody, but just beware of this terrible product, I&#x27;m never using it again.</li>
            <li> My husband got his back waxed but they didn&#x27;t get some of the hair on his lower back. So I suggested&lt;br /&gt;he use this product because I liked it and it worked great for me. I used gloves... always use gloves.&lt;br /&gt;I put the product on his upper arms, butt, lower back and upper legs and it worked wonderfully. He said he is hooked and&lt;br /&gt;he will not be going back to get his back waxed. His time on his upper arm hair was about 3 to 4 mins. He is a red head, semi sensitive skin and he had NO bad reaction. After I took the product off with paper towels he jumped in the shower. And like I said.. he is HOOKED!!</li>
            <li> I regret Buying this product. At first it worked , removing all the hair not burning me and I was happy. Then the hair&#x27;s grew back thicker and harder to get rid of. So I thought it was just my genetics and I put a thicker amount on the hairs. This time it took longer for the hairs to be removed and it burned my skin. It stings when I shower and now I have to wait until I heal to do anything else. I kinda feel hopeless now. I should&#x27;ve listen to the reviews and not try this product. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!.</li>
            <li> I was really lookng forward to this product because I am tired of shaving every day and was looking for a longer lasting alternative. I did the patch test as recommended, had no adverse  reaction and then tried it on my legs.  After no more than 4 minutes on my legs, they started stinging and spots of blood appeared - hair is still there, but I have chemical burns in places.  Thankfully they are not blistering (yet?) but they are painful and red.  AVOID THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> Honestly, I was hesitant to try this because I have very coarse hair on my legs, like man hair coarse. I bought the max because I&#x27;ve found regular Nair just doesn&#x27;t handle my amount of thick hair. I actually didn&#x27;t use this product in the shower but just applied it as instructed and sat on the edge of my tub. It took longer than shaving because I did it in sections but the result was about the same. The only improvement was that I didn&#x27;t have to worry about nicking by bikini area with a razor. It took the entire bottle but both my legs are now hair free from the ankles to my bikini area. In my opinion it&#x27;s a good alternative to shaving if you happen to have a lot of hair (This was my first hair removal of the spring so I had wooly mammoth winter legs) but probably not worth the time for just a bit of stubble. I have to warn you however, you&#x27;re supposed to wash off any product that gets on your hands. Unfortunately for me, by the time I was done applying it, the damage had been done. DO NOT let this product touch your nails! Nails are made of the same stuff as hair and when I was done, I had to trim all my fingernails down to stubs because the tips had become so thin and brittle from exposure to the cream. I may try this again for major hair removal, but next time with gloves.</li>
            <li> All I say is that you need to have hair on your body when you use this. Your pores will start to burn if not. This is not for your face. I used this on my eyebrows and it burned me. use only on legs. Take my advice. Good Luck!</li>
            <li> Let me just say I&#x27;m 11 but I have thick leg hair and I tested on a big patch on my legs. So I applied this to where it was thickest so as I get in the shower I feel irritation on my legs and figure it&#x27;s just like a normal irritation so I get in the shower and it got the hair off but I get out of the shower and look at my leg and its like little cut marks that you get when you fall down in gravel and then I just did my normal routine I went to school and most the day it hurt but as I get home (just now) I go to look at it and then it turns into more like hives....&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed I was bleeding most the day.</li>
            <li> Product worked well the first time &amp; second time on LIMBS! Tried it on the bikini area .... Let&#x27;s just say it burned and burned off some skin and still left some hair  :/ s*** blows</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have course or light hair, I would say I&#x27;m right in the middle. I had no results worth making this purchase worth it. I tried it several times to give it a chance, tried different waiting times, different amounts of the cream, and no results. Very disappointed, I hate shaving.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and the first time i tried it, nothing major has happened. Hair was removed and there were no side effects within 24 hours. however the next day i noticed some serious acne on my butt and back. After I tried the product the second time, i got horrible cystic acne on my back and pimples on my butt and thighs. I called up the company and also found out that not all nair products are the same and have different active and inactive ingredients. i also saw the number of negative reviews on amazon after buying the product and wished i saw them prior to the purchase. do not but this product, huge mistake, will take a month or more to clear up that acne and to get rid of post-inflammatory hyper-pigmentation.</li>
            <li> I am a male and used it on my back and arms. I&#x27;ve used other Nair products but this one has been the best by far. Applicator sponge is great for my wife to apply and doesn&#x27;t get her all messy.  I got 3.5 applications out of it before we ran out.  Follow the directions closely to not get sensitive skin.  Great Product!!</li>
            <li> The product does work but it still leaves behind some hair. Also i left it on for about 4 minutes and when i removed it I was left with burn marks, which are not very cute and burns so much! When the product is placed, the smell is very strong and not very pleasant. Overall though the product manage to get the job done though I think it works best for legs, but beware of your skin type before doing it so as it says in the item try it before putting it over an entire area. Good luck! :)</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have problems with coarse hair on my legs, neck, and chin. I have used the Nair for facial hair before, and it removed all of the hair on my chin, except the dark coarse stuff I wanted to get off. That had been several months ago, and I had been settling for shaving with a razor every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was in Wally-World a few days ago and while looking through the shaving aisle, saw this product. I saw that it was for coarse hair and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first applied it I noticed that a lot of the product went into the sponge and it was hard to get an \\&quot;even, thick layer\\&quot; like the instructions told me to. I got into the shower after applying the product to my legs up to my knees, front of my neck, and chin area where the hair patches are worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After barely being in the shower, I noticed that where I had applied the cream was burning. Now I have bleached the facial hair on my chin before, and when you apply the bleach it burns while it is working, I thought that the same applied here and tried to ignore it. The burning feeling became so bad I had to get the cream off *right then*!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was rubbing the sponge in a circular motion, again like I was instructed, it either completely filled up with the cream, or it started folding into itself because it was so flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;When I finally got all of the cream off, I noticed that there was still hair on my legs, and the coarse hair on my chin the the product was made to work on was still intact as well.&lt;br /&gt;I finished me normal showering routine and got out. When I was back in my room, after getting dressed, I noticed that my legs and face still felt like they were burning. I put some of the moisturizing lotion that came with my Nair facial kit on my chin and neck, thinking that this would help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Mother, who is a practicing nurse, saw me several hours later and said that I have chemical burns. And pretty bad ones at that. I believe her. My face and neck are red, warm to the touch, and have red sores all over. In addition to this the skin in starting to peal.&lt;br /&gt;My legs are not in much better condition, they are bright pink (like I have a bad sunburn), have red splotches on them, and the same red spots that are on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;I have to sleep between two soft towels because I can&#x27;t stand the feeling of the sheets on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not think that I had particularly sensitive skin, and have had no real problem with depilatories or bleaching before this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would caution Anyone who even thinks of using this product. Not only did it badly burn me, but it did not remover the hair like it said it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;User Beware!!</li>
            <li> Perfect for people with coarse hair as it does an amazing job with hair removal from the body especially in that area.  It doesn&#x27;t take long.</li>
            <li> I have stopped shaving my legs with a razor. I have been using this for the past four years and, unless I have my hair removed permanently, do not plan to go back to the razor anytime soon. I don&#x27;t need the power max... regular Nair works for me but I still choose to use the max instead.</li>
            <li> I have used Nair since 2005 so I have seen them change their formulation over the years. This formula is the same but cuts short on the time you need to have it on. I think it is way better since it is a chemical and the sooner you can take it off, the better. You definitely don&#x27;t want it to have it on longer than it what is suggested since it can cause skin irritation. Or worse, I once had a thinner skin on my legs due to dryness and scratching and it caused an open wound. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so important to check your legs first prior to putting this on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this has kept me from constantly shaving my legs and having rough hair or ingrown hair grow on my legs. I do shave my legs for touch-ups after using this. I use this at least once or twice a month. I think a bottle lasts me 3-4 months depending on how fast the hair grows and how clean I want my legs to look (ie. for a short dress or summer season).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to warn you that this does smell, so if you have a very sensitive nose and dislike chemical smells, this is not for you. Might as well stick with waxing or shaving. You also have to apply it and take off the creme with the sponge included with it but after a while the sponge will smell too even with washing.</li>
            <li> Do not but this product. I used this on my legs and left it on for only about five to six minutes. Immediately after applying, I felt a slight burning sensation, but it was negligible. After getting in the shower, I at first used the provided sponge to remove the product, but that was very painful, so I opted for a wash cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this terrible product left behind was about six or seven bleeding, raised blotches on both legs that stung horribly. It was so uncomfortable that the slightest touch of anything against my legs afterwards would elicit stinging, distracting pain. Today, the day after I used it, my legs are a complete mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did it remove the hair? For the most part (I still have a little stubble here and there). Was it worth the pain? Absolutely NOT. No. No way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do NOT buy this product. With all of the negative reviews, it should frankly be taken off the shelves.</li>
            <li> I have tried them all. This is the best hair remover product (and easiest) on the market and I use it weekly. I used to have to shave every day and with this I don&#x27;t notice I need to shave for closer to 5 days. So happy!</li>
            <li> It worked perfectly fine for me. I&#x27;m 25, and I been shaving my legs since I was around 14 years old. And this product worked for me. Hope this helps! Good luck!</li>
