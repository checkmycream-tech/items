            <li>I love &amp;#34;Ringmaster Pain Relief Oil&amp;#34; and</li>
            <li>but I started off with the 1 oz in order to make sure it worked well.  </li>
            <li>This also works as a better alternative for alcohol after the barber or a shave.</li>
            <li>Use before and after working out instead of Ben Gay or Flexall because it works much better and the scent is not as strong.</li>

            <li>That&#x27;s why I thought a 4oz bottle for that price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>Very beneficial and helps my corns on my toes.</li>
            <li>this really works</li>
            <li>Met the original maker of this product who was brought back from the effects of a stroke that affected his legs.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the main thing is that it works.</li>
            <li>the product is Great!That&#x27;s why I hurried to buy more before I ran out of it.rub a little onto a sore muscle,joint or bruise and pain</li>

            <li>I sell the 100% pure Wintergreen essential oil</li>

            <li> I went to order a few more bottles for me and a few friends and found out that Amazon did not have any (at least as of Friday, 7/25/14).</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> This item arrived early.  Which is a big relief because I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t arrive before my dad&#x27;s birthday.  Thanks all for your feedback.  My dad has had gout as he has a problem with arthritis.  He will be one happy dad once he sees this and how good it works.  I like how the plastic is over the cap to keep the bottle from leaking.  I had to get scissors to cut it but that&#x27;s better than it leaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/17/15 Edit:  As I said, got it for my dad and he loves it.  He says that it works really good and the relief is instant.  He also rubs it on his head for headaches and says that it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12/25/16 Edit:  We still love the product.  My dad gave this to my uncle a few months prior.  My dad let me use this a few days ago because I have been congested and let me tell ya, it works wonders.  Methyl Salicylate is found in plants, but most commonly found in Wintergreen.  One hundred percent pure Wintergreen is so underrated but SO useful in many ways.  I sell the 100% pure Wintergreen essential oil and I use it neat.  When I have painful gas or even a headache, I use it.  Buy the Ringmasters bottle.  You can&#x27;t go wrong!!</li>
            <li> The smell was unbearable and it didn&#x27;&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I works overnight. Pain and stiffness gone by morning.&lt;br /&gt;It smells like old fashion linament. It maybe for all i know.&lt;br /&gt;However, the main thing is that it works. Delivery was on time&lt;br /&gt;as promised.</li>
            <li> This product is simply wonderful ! Arrived by USPS very fast with a tracking . My wife injured her need and says ringmaster really relieves the pain.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product from MayaBeauty. The description size said 4oz but you only get the 1oz size. I even requested more info from the seller prior to purchasing. They assured me I would receive a 4oz size. But when I received it it was only 1oz. I contacted seller after receiving the 1oz bottle. I asked why I was only sent 1oz. They admitted it was an employee oversite. They only sell the 1oz size. The info hasn&#x27;t changed on Amazon though. It is only a 1oz bottle as the picture indicates. It is not 4oz as the description indicates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But putting that aside, this product does work. I have the infamous golfer&#x27;s elbow. It aches after a round of golf or after a practice session. I heard good things about Ringmaster so I wanted to try it. At around $12 a 1oz bottle, it does seem a little steep. That&#x27;s why I thought a 4oz bottle for that price was reasonable. Again I only received a 1oz bottle. It was a good purchase from the standpoint that it relieved my pain. I am not sure if another product at a lower price would work better. This product does work for what I needed it to do. I don&#x27;t see this as a permanent fix. I rub a little on my elbow and the pain goes away. \\&quot;Works for Me\\&quot;. When I need it I use it. It does work. Over the long term regular use it may just go away. I can&#x27;t make that claim. It is too early to tell.</li>
            <li> the product is Great!That&#x27;s why I hurried to buy more before I ran out of it.rub a little onto a sore muscle,joint or bruise and pain relief lasts several hours.VERY POOR CUSTOMER&#x27;S SERVICE AND NO TRUTH IN ADVERTISING BY THE VENDOR,HOWEVER.I was mislead by their false ad 2 1/2 weeks AFTER a bad review was written!(I did not read reviews before ordering) The firm advertised a 4oz.bottle but sent a 1oz. bottle for the advertised price!when I had to contact them about my \\&quot;late/missing\\&quot; shipment,they  did not alert me to the deceitful description on the website! The correction was made on the website 3 WEEKS AFTER ANOTHER CUSTOMER COMPLAINED ONLINE.I will continue to use this great product, but will NEVER patronize this vendor again.Their inattention to detail and LACK OF POSITIVE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS UNACCEPTABLE!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 17 years.  I know it works!  Severe arthritis all over my body. Met the original maker of this product who was brought back from the effects of a stroke that affected his legs.  This does come in bigger sizes on ringmaster web site.  Not for people with allergies to peanuts as its made with peanut oil.  Darci, I still have not forgotten you or your fathers kindness.  Bless you both!!</li>
            <li> this is an amazing product introduced to me years ago. I had forgotten it was in my cupboard and started using it again with excellent results for aches and pains of all types</li>
            <li> Love it. Very beneficial and helps my corns on my toes.</li>
            <li> This is the only rubbing pain relief oil that works for me. I went to order a few more bottles for me and a few friends and found out that Amazon did not have any (at least as of Friday, 7/25/14). Had to go to another site to order. I love &amp;#34;Ringmaster Pain Relief Oil&amp;#34; and yes &amp;#34;in my opinion&amp;#34; 5-stars are correct!</li>
            <li> Have to buy it,mother was having leg and thigh problems,and every single problem is gone ,I will recommend this product</li>
            <li> Purchased the unit at the recommendation of a friend, but it did not meet expectation.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t terribly impressed with this product. Shipping was prompt.</li>
            <li> I started using this oil from visiting a flea market I told this man about my ache from a hip replacement I bought a bottle and he gave me a bottle started using it at night I notice when I get up in the morning I didn&#x27;t have that stiffness so I didn&#x27;t using it for few days my ache was back along with the stiffness this really works try it for ur self and miss a few days u will see it works.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!  I suffer with a lot of back pain, and this Oil  eliminates my pain.  The down-side is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Hard to find in stores because it sells out fast.&lt;br /&gt;-  I wish it came in a bigger bottle.&lt;br /&gt;- The Oil has a minty/methol smell so I can only use it before going to bed.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but I started off with the 1 oz in order to make sure it worked well.  Works great for muscle pain.  Use before and after working out instead of Ben Gay or Flexall because it works much better and the scent is not as strong.</li>
            <li> This stuff helps with EVERYTHING. it heals bumps, bruises, and aches. I&#x27;ve been using this for years and it has, never failed. This also works as a better alternative for alcohol after the barber or a shave.</li>
