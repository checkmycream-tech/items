            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why all the amazing reviews.</li>
            <li>, it does feel nice.  </li>
            <li>the best I&#x27;ve  come up with is that it&#x27;s squishy like a marshmallow, but holds together and is gently exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>It was nice for a week, then it started deteriorating...</li>
            <li>I received this product in exchange for a honest review.</li>

            <li>Just seems better for the environment .</li>
            <li>The face product is much better.</li>
            <li>This might be my most favorite beauty product ever.</li>
            <li>- I feel like it&#x27;s better for the environment.</li>
            <li>I find they help with their skin issues :)  </li>
            <li>sure if I will get another.</li>
            <li>I liked the groove son the back because they fit my fingers perfectly and made it easier to hold.  </li>
            <li>I put a piece of string on a needle and poked it through the top and tied a knot to make a way to hang it.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s cruelty free!</li>
            <li>I think it makes my moisturizer better too.  </li>
            <li>Really love this product</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these sponges.  </li>
            <li>I love it and am ordering more</li>

            <li>I love this sponge.</li>
            <li>Love the texture and the scent.</li>
            <li>but since I use &#x27;my konjac sponge&#x27; my skin feel softer and more supple...</li>
            <li>I love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am in my mid 60&#x27;s and in excellent health</li>
            <li>But i love the konjac sponge for face though.</li>
            <li>When I tried the facial sponge, I had no clue how impressed with it I would be.</li>
            <li>love the thickness of the body sponge</li>
            <li>I really love Konjac</li>
            <li>absolutely my favorite body sponge  </li>
            <li>I think my face agrees w me, this is the best My Konjac Sponge, as it is not only cleansing but moisturizing my skin too.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am still using one that I already had but haven&#x27;t been able to find a replacement when and if it dies out.  </li>
            <li>Really fantastic product!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I could love My Konjac Sponge anymore</li>
            <li>so I like it more this way, achieving perfection whilst not harming the biggest organ of our body - skin.</li>
            <li>If you are worried about bacterial infestation, you can always microwave this before using for 3 minutes, making sure you microwave both sides up.</li>
            <li>More like a sponge.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>and I love it..</li>
            <li>It is much better than any sponge I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find any better product out there.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I will need to buy more.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this brand.</li>
            <li>but, I feel that it cleans much better.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I recently ordered another for myself, and one for my best friend.  </li>
            <li>and I knew she would love it, too.  </li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>LOVE it.</li>
            <li>just the right amount for a good body wash.  </li>
            <li>If you use it with shower gel, or a gentle soap, you get a luxurious lather for a very nice shower.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good!  </li>
            <li>Even without soap you get a nice clean feeling all over which</li>
            <li>It is good at exfoliating, but it is very gentle</li>
            <li>My skin feels very clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and this is the softest sponge of any kind that touched my skin and felt good about it.</li>
            <li>Great product and super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>It is very soft but is very effective.  </li>
            <li>$8 gives me pimple free face :)</li>
            <li>I like using LUSH&#x27;s Happy Hippy shower gel with this sponge.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use too much soap with it because it is great at absorbing and suds up nicely.</li>
            <li>Unique and outstanding.</li>
            <li>Love this for full body cleansing.</li>
            <li>It is way softer than my normal konjac sponge ,and not in a good way.</li>
            <li>but otherwise it is a very good sponge to have if you have dry and itchy skin...</li>
            <li>Absolutely excellent little body sponge.</li>
            <li>Cheap material..</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more impressed and will definitely be purchasing more sponges from this company in the future!</li>
            <li>but I prefer to use the smooth edge on my skin and place the waved edge in my hand.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this sponge.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I received a free sponge in exchange for a review.</li>
            <li>They are fantastic.</li>
            <li>I loved the idea of it because when you are done with it you can throw it in the compost and since it&#x27;s a natural root</li>
            <li>I was searching for good sponge for my baby as he got sensitive skin, until I found this product and tried it on him.</li>
            <li>Right away I fell in love.  </li>
            <li>It rinses easily and dries out quickly.  </li>
            <li>The body sponge easily and quickly absorbs in water</li>
            <li>Exfoliates super gently, while effectively.</li>
            <li>I have been using the body sponge for two weeks now, and see a significant difference on my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen significant improvement in the dryness of my skin since using this item.</li>
            <li>Again, love the way it makes me feel so much cleaner!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li>My skin feel so clean and fresh after using it!</li>
            <li>you can microwave it to clean it so it doesnt&#x27; get  </li>
            <li>It gets you clean</li>
            <li>clean and sanitize you can place the sponge in a bowl of water, then into the microwave for about one minute.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin soft; it&#x27;s great for the whole body and face.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty large sponge which makes it great for cleaning your whole body.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely easy to use, and it will work with all sorts of body washes, from your general foaming types and the kind with exfoliators in it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find this to be anything special.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle and good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Always consistent product, works great, my husband swears by this and the facial konjac sponge.</li>
            <li>I love it so much..  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times, but it seems to be doing a good job.</li>
            <li>and it makes the skin feel so much better without having to do so much work.</li>
            <li>I love the gentle exfoliation and cleansing from Konjac sponges.</li>
            <li>Apparently it is totally true that this body bath sponge helps circulate the blood flow.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Economical and gentle for sure.</li>
            <li>I have also tried it in the french clay version and love that one even more.</li>
            <li>Their facial sponges are great, this body sponge not so much.  </li>
            <li>If you love the My Konjac facial sponges, you&#x27;ll love the body sponge.</li>
            <li>For this price I don&#x27;t feel it should have deteriorated that quickly.</li>
            <li>The sponge fell apart after a week of use, mild use at that.</li>
            <li>You barely have to use any soap at all because it lathers up so nicely.</li>
            <li>I also highly recommend the bamboo charcoal facial Konjac sponge with works great on oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wish there were bigger sizes, but I love it!</li>
            <li>Best for delicate skin!</li>
            <li>I find that this sponge offers the perfect amount of exfoliation without being too harsh, which can be the case with some sponges.</li>
            <li>Not really crazy about it.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel it was worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that my skin has improved a lot, it looks fresh and moisturized.</li>
            <li>but I have only been using this sponge for 1 week and already the skin is once again looking healthy, obviously this promotes good circulation.</li>
            <li>The sponge feels so soft and I love the fact that it exfoliates.  </li>
            <li>I tried out this same companies Charcoal facial sponge and was so impressed with it that when I was given the chance to try out the body sponge, I absolutely had to have it.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact this sponge is 100% natural and even biodegradable.</li>
            <li>Moreover, it is an all natural product that is safe for adults and for children.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>First, they last a long time without tearing and you can sanitize them, which is a huge plus!!!!</li>
            <li>I definitely think they are worth the price and will purchase again! :)</li>
            <li>and I love it so much more than any other sponge I have used.</li>
            <li>This is an interesting product to have and if you don&#x27;t like rough loofas and have sensitive dry skin like me then this is a perfect gadget for your bathing needs.</li>
            <li>I swear it makes me feel cleaner and is just the right size for me, as a woman.</li>
            <li>It is higher priced than the synthetic sponges I had been buying - but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>Maybe its suitable for a child or a baby&#x27;s skin only.</li>
            <li>it would itch more and hurt more from that harsh sponge...</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t felt it does very much for my skin....</li>
            <li>This sponge is very gentle and it saves a lot of soap.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle and non-abrasive.</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>The ridges in it make it super easy to hold, and I will definitely be purchasing another once this one is done.</li>
            <li>I really like this sponge - it lathers up easily, helps rinse your face off and leaves your skin very soft.  </li>
            <li>Awesome body sponge, just a little soap goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I use this for my newborn, who has skin sensitivities, and the sponge is so gentle!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure was entirely possible.</li>
            <li>If you have gentle cleaning needs, BUY it!</li>
            <li>only thing that i didn&#x27;t love about this sponge, when u put it in the water</li>
            <li>This is so much better than the net sponges.  </li>
            <li>I ordered (for the first time) a bath and a face sponge.  </li>
            <li>The fact that the  sponge increases the skin&#x27;s alkalinity is what interested me in getting the body wave sponge.</li>
            <li>I like this better than the net scrubber that I was using.</li>
            <li>This sponge has really improved the condition of my skin!</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time tonight</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I started out with the facial sponges and fell in love.</li>
            <li>I purchased this along with the Konjac facial sponge, which I love; however, this doesn&#x27;t hold up as well.  </li>
            <li>I love to use this instead of my regular loofah for shower.</li>
            <li>The feeling might take some getting used to at first</li>
            <li>I had never heard of these before when I ordered the first time, but I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>MY KONJAC SPONGE 100% Natural Fiber Konjac Original Six Wave Body Sponge</li>
            <li>i bought this for bathing my baby thinking it is soft and clean but have mold and smell after using it about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>The main issue was the lack of exfoliation, I just really didn&#x27;t think this sponge was doing anything to really get my skin clean.  </li>
            <li>It feels soft but sturdy - and I love knowing that it is made from natural fibers.  </li>
            <li>it lasted two months, which is a short time, but I still love it so much.  </li>
            <li>This sponge is super soft!</li>
            <li>It lathers up very easily, and I use it with natural soaps that are infused with essential oils.</li>
            <li>I wish they had a string loop to be able to hang these and allow dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft and everything lathers well with it.  </li>
            <li>It has just the right texture to be only mildly abrasive --</li>
            <li>It fits comfortably in your hand and is large enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li>I really, really like the Konjac sponge.</li>
            <li>Really like this.</li>
            <li>It really extends the life of your bar soap.</li>
            <li>but it seems to really exfoliate</li>
            <li>I use a different one for my face, but this is fabulous for my body.  </li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin, and this is the only product I&#x27;ve found that exfoliates my skin without making me turn bright red.</li>
            <li>This is so soft when wet, suds up nicely, but really doesn&#x27;t exfoliate much.</li>
            <li>This sponge suds really well.</li>
            <li>All I had to do was get it wet, use soap and just enjoy!</li>
            <li>This works so much better than a rough washcloth or a loofah that falls apart.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to this product.  </li>
            <li>My husband wants one now as well.</li>
            <li>I really like how my skin feels.</li>
            <li>I found it, and it really does make my skin feel smoother.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s gentle enough for your most sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li>It has completely replaced my regular Puffy loofa and it works SO much better.</li>
            <li>My husband even surprised when i don&#x27;t ask him any more to itch my back...</li>
            <li>Most of the other reviewers had it correct.  </li>
            <li>often than not, original is usually the best,</li>
            <li>After use it does dry out but rehydrates easily in water.</li>
            <li>That being said, I do think they are cleansing only because I &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; clean afterwards, and besides, I know there cannot be any soap residue.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of small.</li>
            <li>cool feature about this sponge is that your body wash will go a lot further!</li>
            <li>But even if that happens, the cost of the sponge is low enough and the performance is good enough that it will justify repeat purchases for me.</li>
            <li>Getting new one!</li>
            <li>My new sponge go to!</li>
            <li>The last ones I have gotten from Amazon were falling apart quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have enjoyed the Konjac sponges I have purchased and although they will not last forever you can extend their life by treating them properly - don&#x27;t scrunch them up to get water out.</li>
            <li>but my skin is getting older.</li>
            <li>I have used loofah sponges which feel more abrasive than this sponge and in fact I was really skeptical that this was going to be better than any loofah pad</li>
            <li>I love using it on my shoulders and upper back because it seems like it stays the driest</li>
            <li>It deteriorates too quickly, shrivels up to almost nothing after several uses.</li>
            <li>Really soft, durable, and only takes a small amount of soap to get a great lather.</li>
            <li>Overall, it works for any skin type, you can put a little bit soap on it or not (if you&#x27;re planning to have a quick shower) and it is safe for the environment when you&#x27;re done with it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product and the seller.</li>
            <li>If you like sponge you will love this, but if you like something a little scratchy this is not for you.</li>
            <li>This is the \\&quot;plain\\&quot; sponge and offers gentle cleansing with or without soap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft yet it really cleans and exfoliates all parts of the body.</li>
            <li>This is a sponge I can recommend to everyone because it is so soft and gentle yet seems to exfoliate the skin too.</li>
            <li>I had a healed sore on my lower leg that was just not letting the skin return to normal</li>
            <li>I mean that&#x27;s what makes them so popular right?&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked the sponge and really felt my skin even feels smoother since using it.&lt;br /&gt;Two issues I don&#x27;t like, the size is too small , needs to be larger and after only&lt;</li>
            <li>It is a little bigger than my palm and feels nice to use in the shower.</li>
            <li>and it is like new still.</li>
            <li>I would say we order a new one every 4-8 weeks.</li>
            <li>I am  a new user to the Konjac sponges.</li>
            <li>How did I live without these sponges?</li>
            <li>Soft with decent exfoliation.</li>
            <li>A decent sponge but shrinks considerably when it dries.</li>
            <li>MY SKIN FEELS VERY SOFT AND</li>
            <li>My face was so soft and that said, I had high expectations for the body sponge.</li>
            <li>You need very little to get and maintain a lather which is lovely.</li>
            <li>Oh, and did I say they are all natural?!  </li>
            <li>and yet it just feels very luxurious not rough.</li>
            <li>I was instantly amazed by the texture and it actually made washing my face FUN!</li>
            <li>I was using a small one from Boscia on my face that costs much, much more.  </li>
            <li>I started looking because my grandmother has super sensitive, dry skin.  </li>
            <li>WHEN YOU USE THIS SPONGE FOR YOUR BODY IN THE SHOWER YOU WILL CLEAN AND EXFOLIATE AT THE SAME TIME WITHOUT HAVING TO EXFOLIATE AND THEN WASH WITH 2 DIFFERENT PRODUCTS....</li>
            <li>The body sponge gently massage my skin and smooths out all the dry rough spots instantly the sponge is very quick to clean simply rinse, squeeze and let it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Another reason why I think this product is fantastic is how long lasting it is.</li>
            <li>All you have to do to maximize its longevity is to gently press the water out of it between your hands (wringing it will cause it to deteriorate much faster) and allow it to air dry between uses.</li>
            <li>It is gentle enough that I can see myself using it on my face, but I don&#x27;t since I use this sponge to clean my other body parts</li>
            <li>You need very little liquid body cleanser to clean your whole body.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft enough and it dries fast</li>
            <li>My sensitive skin loves it.  </li>
            <li>Even though it looks like a pumice stone in the photos, once you add water it turns into a soft sponge.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s too soft.</li>
            <li>I gave her some fabulous cleansing shower oil which helped, but it wouldn&#x27;t lather with a washcloth and the washcloth was too harsh.  </li>
            <li>so far....</li>
            <li>Feels soft yet exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>since it&#x27;s natural eco-friendly,too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft on my skin</li>
            <li>♡ my skin is so soft</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way too soft and does not hold body wash.</li>
            <li>Put it in the water, let it get soft and scrub away.</li>
            <li>It exfoliates so well that when I get out of the tub or shower, I can&#x27;t help but feel how soft my skin is.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s ready for your next use.</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin that produces pimple in the presence of make up/moisturizer/ sunscreen residues.</li>
            <li>The skin exfoliation is gentle, and you will feel as if your skin is cleaner than when you use a regular bath puff or washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sponge is soft, non abrasive and holds water well.</li>
            <li>It is soft and glides on the body seamlessly.</li>
            <li>I had very itchy back</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li>The sponge feels soft on your skin.</li>
            <li>My konjac sponge makes shower time luxurious, and leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>It gently exfoliates so well that you may not even notice that it has because your skin is absolutely left without any signs of irritation.</li>
            <li>I like this: Biodegradable/Compostable, Natural, Produces a Thick Dense Lather, Can be Sanitized,Dye Free, Gentle.</li>
            <li>I was just hoping for a soft exfoliating bath sponge.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this product, although it is extremely soft once it is wet, really does gently exfoliate without irritation.  </li>
            <li>the sponge is really soft but still works the job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually found that it produces a lather much better than the everyday plastic pouf.</li>
            <li>I mentioned in other reviews of this product line; I took the risk, and it&#x27;s the risk worth taking!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have recently (in the past couple of months) been introduced to Konjac sponges and I am glad that I was.</li>
            <li>I use these on my little ones, as they have super sensitive skin....</li>
            <li>When you first get the sponge it will be hard and coarse, but when you wet it the feel becomes soft and light, like a marshmallow!</li>
            <li>So the first thing I noted when I opened the package, was that it was wet.</li>
            <li>When I used loofah, shower puff, or wash towel in the past, they all made my skin feel dry as if stripped of from my own body oil, especially during winter time..</li>
            <li>contact with water springs back like new</li>
            <li>This one is big enough to use on the whole body.  </li>
            <li>So far this sponge has left my skin feeling soft and has removed the dryness.  </li>
            <li>Soft enough for my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and the mesh pouf I had was starting to irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>However, after a little over a week of normal use I have large tears in the sponge on the side with the grooves.  </li>
            <li>and I generally use it 3-4 times a week.</li>
            <li>I far prefer the Konjac sponge to a regular shower pouf/loofah.</li>
            <li>It is soft enough to use on my face.</li>
            <li>It is also a totally natural product that deep cleanses the skin.</li>
            <li>Nice sponge, my boyfriend say he likes it, kinda expensive though.</li>
            <li>The body sponge was just kind of weird for me.  </li>
            <li>It was kind of difficult to grip</li>
            <li>Do you know how hard it is to clean your face with a loofah?</li>
            <li>It is smooth on the skin, it doesn&#x27;t dry the skin, and also I only need to put a little soap when I use it to take shower.</li>
            <li>This was much more expensive than the old type I had</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also completely non-exfoliating (as in way too soft and gentle - for a guy at least).</li>
            <li>My only problem with this sponge is that no matter how hard I try, I can&#x27;t totally clean the sponge in between uses.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold and clean your body with, however it&#x27;s less aggressive than my shower gloves, so I&#x27;m afraid this isn&#x27;t going to be a staple for me.  </li>

            <li> It lathers great and leaves your skin feeling really smooth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why all the amazing reviews.</li>
            <li> , it does feel nice.  </li>
            <li> the best I&#x27;ve  come up with is that it&#x27;s squishy like a marshmallow, but holds together and is gently exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> It was nice for a week, then it started deteriorating...</li>
            <li> I received this product in exchange for a honest review.</li>

            <li> I put a piece of string on a needle and poked it through the top and tied a knot to make a way to hang it.  </li>

            <li> I think my face agrees w me, this is the best My Konjac Sponge, as it is not only cleansing but moisturizing my skin too.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am still using one that I already had but haven&#x27;t been able to find a replacement when and if it dies out.  </li>
            <li> Really fantastic product!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I could love My Konjac Sponge anymore</li>
            <li> so I like it more this way, achieving perfection whilst not harming the biggest organ of our body - skin.</li>
            <li> If you are worried about bacterial infestation, you can always microwave this before using for 3 minutes, making sure you microwave both sides up.</li>
            <li> More like a sponge.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> and I love it..</li>
            <li> It is much better than any sponge I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find any better product out there.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I will need to buy more.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this brand.</li>
            <li> but, I feel that it cleans much better.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I recently ordered another for myself, and one for my best friend.  </li>
            <li> and I knew she would love it, too.  </li>
            <li> :)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> LOVE it.</li>
            <li> just the right amount for a good body wash.  </li>
            <li> If you use it with shower gel, or a gentle soap, you get a luxurious lather for a very nice shower.  </li>
            <li> So far, so good!  </li>
            <li> Even without soap you get a nice clean feeling all over which</li>
            <li> It is good at exfoliating, but it is very gentle</li>
            <li> My skin feels very clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and this is the softest sponge of any kind that touched my skin and felt good about it.</li>
            <li> Great product and super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> It is very soft but is very effective.  </li>
            <li> $8 gives me pimple free face :)</li>
            <li> I like using LUSH&#x27;s Happy Hippy shower gel with this sponge.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use too much soap with it because it is great at absorbing and suds up nicely.</li>
            <li> Unique and outstanding.</li>
            <li> Love this for full body cleansing.</li>
            <li> It is way softer than my normal konjac sponge ,and not in a good way.</li>
            <li> but otherwise it is a very good sponge to have if you have dry and itchy skin...</li>
            <li> Absolutely excellent little body sponge.</li>
            <li> Cheap material..</li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more impressed and will definitely be purchasing more sponges from this company in the future!</li>
            <li> but I prefer to use the smooth edge on my skin and place the waved edge in my hand.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this sponge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I received a free sponge in exchange for a review.</li>
            <li> They are fantastic.</li>
            <li> I loved the idea of it because when you are done with it you can throw it in the compost and since it&#x27;s a natural root</li>
            <li> I was searching for good sponge for my baby as he got sensitive skin, until I found this product and tried it on him.</li>
            <li> Right away I fell in love.  </li>
            <li> It rinses easily and dries out quickly.  </li>
            <li> The body sponge easily and quickly absorbs in water</li>
            <li> Exfoliates super gently, while effectively.</li>
            <li> I have been using the body sponge for two weeks now, and see a significant difference on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen significant improvement in the dryness of my skin since using this item.</li>
            <li> Again, love the way it makes me feel so much cleaner!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li> My skin feel so clean and fresh after using it!</li>
            <li> you can microwave it to clean it so it doesnt&#x27; get  </li>
            <li> It gets you clean</li>
            <li> clean and sanitize you can place the sponge in a bowl of water, then into the microwave for about one minute.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin soft; it&#x27;s great for the whole body and face.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty large sponge which makes it great for cleaning your whole body.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely easy to use, and it will work with all sorts of body washes, from your general foaming types and the kind with exfoliators in it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this to be anything special.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle and good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Always consistent product, works great, my husband swears by this and the facial konjac sponge.</li>
            <li> I love it so much..  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times, but it seems to be doing a good job.</li>
            <li> and it makes the skin feel so much better without having to do so much work.</li>
            <li> I love the gentle exfoliation and cleansing from Konjac sponges.</li>
            <li> Apparently it is totally true that this body bath sponge helps circulate the blood flow.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Economical and gentle for sure.</li>
            <li> I have also tried it in the french clay version and love that one even more.</li>
            <li> Their facial sponges are great, this body sponge not so much.  </li>
            <li> If you love the My Konjac facial sponges, you&#x27;ll love the body sponge.</li>
            <li> For this price I don&#x27;t feel it should have deteriorated that quickly.</li>
            <li> The sponge fell apart after a week of use, mild use at that.</li>
            <li> You barely have to use any soap at all because it lathers up so nicely.</li>
            <li> I also highly recommend the bamboo charcoal facial Konjac sponge with works great on oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wish there were bigger sizes, but I love it!</li>
            <li> Best for delicate skin!</li>
            <li> I find that this sponge offers the perfect amount of exfoliation without being too harsh, which can be the case with some sponges.</li>
            <li> Not really crazy about it.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my skin has improved a lot, it looks fresh and moisturized.</li>
            <li> but I have only been using this sponge for 1 week and already the skin is once again looking healthy, obviously this promotes good circulation.</li>
            <li> The sponge feels so soft and I love the fact that it exfoliates.  </li>
            <li> I tried out this same companies Charcoal facial sponge and was so impressed with it that when I was given the chance to try out the body sponge, I absolutely had to have it.</li>
            <li> I also love the fact this sponge is 100% natural and even biodegradable.</li>
            <li> Moreover, it is an all natural product that is safe for adults and for children.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> First, they last a long time without tearing and you can sanitize them, which is a huge plus!!!!</li>
            <li> I definitely think they are worth the price and will purchase again! :)</li>
            <li> and I love it so much more than any other sponge I have used.</li>
            <li> This is an interesting product to have and if you don&#x27;t like rough loofas and have sensitive dry skin like me then this is a perfect gadget for your bathing needs.</li>
            <li> I swear it makes me feel cleaner and is just the right size for me, as a woman.</li>
            <li> It is higher priced than the synthetic sponges I had been buying - but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Maybe its suitable for a child or a baby&#x27;s skin only.</li>
            <li> it would itch more and hurt more from that harsh sponge...</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t felt it does very much for my skin....</li>
            <li> This sponge is very gentle and it saves a lot of soap.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle and non-abrasive.</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> The ridges in it make it super easy to hold, and I will definitely be purchasing another once this one is done.</li>
            <li> I really like this sponge - it lathers up easily, helps rinse your face off and leaves your skin very soft.  </li>
            <li> Awesome body sponge, just a little soap goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use this for my newborn, who has skin sensitivities, and the sponge is so gentle!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure was entirely possible.</li>
            <li> If you have gentle cleaning needs, BUY it!</li>
            <li> only thing that i didn&#x27;t love about this sponge, when u put it in the water</li>
            <li> This is so much better than the net sponges.  </li>
            <li> I ordered (for the first time) a bath and a face sponge.  </li>
            <li> The fact that the  sponge increases the skin&#x27;s alkalinity is what interested me in getting the body wave sponge.</li>
            <li> I like this better than the net scrubber that I was using.</li>
            <li> This sponge has really improved the condition of my skin!</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time tonight</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I started out with the facial sponges and fell in love.</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with the Konjac facial sponge, which I love; however, this doesn&#x27;t hold up as well.  </li>
            <li> I love to use this instead of my regular loofah for shower.</li>
            <li> The feeling might take some getting used to at first</li>
            <li> I had never heard of these before when I ordered the first time, but I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> MY KONJAC SPONGE 100% Natural Fiber Konjac Original Six Wave Body Sponge</li>
            <li> i bought this for bathing my baby thinking it is soft and clean but have mold and smell after using it about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> The main issue was the lack of exfoliation, I just really didn&#x27;t think this sponge was doing anything to really get my skin clean.  </li>
            <li> It feels soft but sturdy - and I love knowing that it is made from natural fibers.  </li>
            <li> it lasted two months, which is a short time, but I still love it so much.  </li>
            <li> This sponge is super soft!</li>
            <li> It lathers up very easily, and I use it with natural soaps that are infused with essential oils.</li>
            <li> I wish they had a string loop to be able to hang these and allow dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super soft and everything lathers well with it.  </li>
            <li> It has just the right texture to be only mildly abrasive --</li>
            <li> It fits comfortably in your hand and is large enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I really, really like the Konjac sponge.</li>
            <li> Really like this.</li>
            <li> It really extends the life of your bar soap.</li>
            <li> but it seems to really exfoliate</li>
            <li> I use a different one for my face, but this is fabulous for my body.  </li>
            <li> Fast service.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin, and this is the only product I&#x27;ve found that exfoliates my skin without making me turn bright red.</li>
            <li> This is so soft when wet, suds up nicely, but really doesn&#x27;t exfoliate much.</li>
            <li> This sponge suds really well.</li>
            <li> All I had to do was get it wet, use soap and just enjoy!</li>
            <li> This works so much better than a rough washcloth or a loofah that falls apart.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to this product.  </li>
            <li> My husband wants one now as well.</li>
            <li> I really like how my skin feels.</li>
            <li> I found it, and it really does make my skin feel smoother.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s gentle enough for your most sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li> It has completely replaced my regular Puffy loofa and it works SO much better.</li>
            <li> My husband even surprised when i don&#x27;t ask him any more to itch my back...</li>
            <li> Most of the other reviewers had it correct.  </li>
            <li> often than not, original is usually the best,</li>
            <li> After use it does dry out but rehydrates easily in water.</li>
            <li> That being said, I do think they are cleansing only because I &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; clean afterwards, and besides, I know there cannot be any soap residue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of small.</li>
            <li> cool feature about this sponge is that your body wash will go a lot further!</li>
            <li> But even if that happens, the cost of the sponge is low enough and the performance is good enough that it will justify repeat purchases for me.</li>
            <li> Getting new one!</li>
            <li> My new sponge go to!</li>
            <li> The last ones I have gotten from Amazon were falling apart quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have enjoyed the Konjac sponges I have purchased and although they will not last forever you can extend their life by treating them properly - don&#x27;t scrunch them up to get water out.</li>
            <li> but my skin is getting older.</li>
            <li> I have used loofah sponges which feel more abrasive than this sponge and in fact I was really skeptical that this was going to be better than any loofah pad</li>
            <li> I love using it on my shoulders and upper back because it seems like it stays the driest</li>
            <li> It deteriorates too quickly, shrivels up to almost nothing after several uses.</li>
            <li> Really soft, durable, and only takes a small amount of soap to get a great lather.</li>
            <li> Overall, it works for any skin type, you can put a little bit soap on it or not (if you&#x27;re planning to have a quick shower) and it is safe for the environment when you&#x27;re done with it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product and the seller.</li>
            <li> If you like sponge you will love this, but if you like something a little scratchy this is not for you.</li>
            <li> This is the \\&quot;plain\\&quot; sponge and offers gentle cleansing with or without soap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft yet it really cleans and exfoliates all parts of the body.</li>
            <li> This is a sponge I can recommend to everyone because it is so soft and gentle yet seems to exfoliate the skin too.</li>
            <li> I had a healed sore on my lower leg that was just not letting the skin return to normal</li>
            <li> I mean that&#x27;s what makes them so popular right?&lt;br</li>
            <li> I liked the sponge and really felt my skin even feels smoother since using it.&lt;br /&gt;Two issues I don&#x27;t like, the size is too small , needs to be larger and after only&lt;</li>
            <li> It is a little bigger than my palm and feels nice to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> and it is like new still.</li>
            <li> I would say we order a new one every 4-8 weeks.</li>
            <li> I am  a new user to the Konjac sponges.</li>
            <li> How did I live without these sponges?</li>
            <li> Soft with decent exfoliation.</li>
            <li> A decent sponge but shrinks considerably when it dries.</li>
            <li> MY SKIN FEELS VERY SOFT AND</li>
            <li> My face was so soft and that said, I had high expectations for the body sponge.</li>
            <li> You need very little to get and maintain a lather which is lovely.</li>
            <li> Oh, and did I say they are all natural?!  </li>
            <li> and yet it just feels very luxurious not rough.</li>
            <li> I was instantly amazed by the texture and it actually made washing my face FUN!</li>
            <li> I was using a small one from Boscia on my face that costs much, much more.  </li>
            <li> I started looking because my grandmother has super sensitive, dry skin.  </li>
            <li> WHEN YOU USE THIS SPONGE FOR YOUR BODY IN THE SHOWER YOU WILL CLEAN AND EXFOLIATE AT THE SAME TIME WITHOUT HAVING TO EXFOLIATE AND THEN WASH WITH 2 DIFFERENT PRODUCTS....</li>
            <li> The body sponge gently massage my skin and smooths out all the dry rough spots instantly the sponge is very quick to clean simply rinse, squeeze and let it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another reason why I think this product is fantastic is how long lasting it is.</li>
            <li> All you have to do to maximize its longevity is to gently press the water out of it between your hands (wringing it will cause it to deteriorate much faster) and allow it to air dry between uses.</li>
            <li> It is gentle enough that I can see myself using it on my face, but I don&#x27;t since I use this sponge to clean my other body parts</li>
            <li> You need very little liquid body cleanser to clean your whole body.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft enough and it dries fast</li>
            <li> My sensitive skin loves it.  </li>
            <li> Even though it looks like a pumice stone in the photos, once you add water it turns into a soft sponge.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s too soft.</li>
            <li> I gave her some fabulous cleansing shower oil which helped, but it wouldn&#x27;t lather with a washcloth and the washcloth was too harsh.  </li>
            <li> so far....</li>
            <li> Feels soft yet exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> since it&#x27;s natural eco-friendly,too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft on my skin</li>
            <li> ♡ my skin is so soft</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too soft and does not hold body wash.</li>
            <li> Put it in the water, let it get soft and scrub away.</li>
            <li> It exfoliates so well that when I get out of the tub or shower, I can&#x27;t help but feel how soft my skin is.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s ready for your next use.</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin that produces pimple in the presence of make up/moisturizer/ sunscreen residues.</li>
            <li> The skin exfoliation is gentle, and you will feel as if your skin is cleaner than when you use a regular bath puff or washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sponge is soft, non abrasive and holds water well.</li>
            <li> It is soft and glides on the body seamlessly.</li>
            <li> I had very itchy back</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li> The sponge feels soft on your skin.</li>
            <li> My konjac sponge makes shower time luxurious, and leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> It gently exfoliates so well that you may not even notice that it has because your skin is absolutely left without any signs of irritation.</li>
            <li> I like this: Biodegradable/Compostable, Natural, Produces a Thick Dense Lather, Can be Sanitized,Dye Free, Gentle.</li>
            <li> I was just hoping for a soft exfoliating bath sponge.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this product, although it is extremely soft once it is wet, really does gently exfoliate without irritation.  </li>
            <li> the sponge is really soft but still works the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually found that it produces a lather much better than the everyday plastic pouf.</li>
            <li> I mentioned in other reviews of this product line; I took the risk, and it&#x27;s the risk worth taking!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have recently (in the past couple of months) been introduced to Konjac sponges and I am glad that I was.</li>
            <li> I use these on my little ones, as they have super sensitive skin....</li>
            <li> When you first get the sponge it will be hard and coarse, but when you wet it the feel becomes soft and light, like a marshmallow!</li>
            <li> So the first thing I noted when I opened the package, was that it was wet.</li>
            <li> When I used loofah, shower puff, or wash towel in the past, they all made my skin feel dry as if stripped of from my own body oil, especially during winter time..</li>
            <li> contact with water springs back like new</li>
            <li> This one is big enough to use on the whole body.  </li>
            <li> So far this sponge has left my skin feeling soft and has removed the dryness.  </li>
            <li> Soft enough for my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and the mesh pouf I had was starting to irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> However, after a little over a week of normal use I have large tears in the sponge on the side with the grooves.  </li>
            <li> and I generally use it 3-4 times a week.</li>
            <li> I far prefer the Konjac sponge to a regular shower pouf/loofah.</li>
            <li> It is soft enough to use on my face.</li>
            <li> It is also a totally natural product that deep cleanses the skin.</li>
            <li> Nice sponge, my boyfriend say he likes it, kinda expensive though.</li>
            <li> The body sponge was just kind of weird for me.  </li>
            <li> It was kind of difficult to grip</li>
            <li> Do you know how hard it is to clean your face with a loofah?</li>
            <li> It is smooth on the skin, it doesn&#x27;t dry the skin, and also I only need to put a little soap when I use it to take shower.</li>
            <li> This was much more expensive than the old type I had</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also completely non-exfoliating (as in way too soft and gentle - for a guy at least).</li>
            <li> My only problem with this sponge is that no matter how hard I try, I can&#x27;t totally clean the sponge in between uses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to hold and clean your body with, however it&#x27;s less aggressive than my shower gloves, so I&#x27;m afraid this isn&#x27;t going to be a staple for me.  </li>
            <li> It was not a huge sponge so it could have worked for the face too, but I thought it was big enough to use on the whole body.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t normally use bath sponge for bath just because I always think the sponge is not clean enough (soap residue), but not this sponge.</li>
            <li> My only issue is they don&#x27;t last as long as I would like, after a couple months they start to fall apart.</li>
            <li> and my skin became really soft and less bumpy around my arms and my back.</li>
            <li> it really does leave your skin softer, I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> THE SPONGE IS LONG LASTING AND FEELS WONDERUL ON YOUR SKIN...</li>
            <li> and it get flat.</li>
            <li> so hopefully it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Really long lasting!</li>
            <li> It seems to be very long lasting as well.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s completely dry by the next days shower</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soft and silky while in the shower, but even at half the price I paid, $12.99, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t think it will last as long as there was no string and cannot hang it up to dry.</li>
            <li> It really does not work as a body sponge, for me at least.</li>
            <li> This could be since my soap uses a lot of oils, but I hold the sponge under running water for a long time and it will forever retain some soapiness.</li>
            <li> I used to wash my body with regular shower puff and sometimes it scratched my skin because it is too rough.</li>
            <li> I find the larger sized sponges such as this one last a little longer than the smaller round facial sponges.</li>
            <li> Kind of ugly sticking them out on our bathroom counter after each shower so they can dry (as the instructions state you need to).</li>
            <li> and it never loses its thickness unlike other body sponges i had purchased after a few use</li>
            <li> I do like this sponge and got rid of my other sponges and only use this.</li>
            <li> dry out well and no odor&lt;</li>
            <li> I let it dry out on one of the wire racks of our shower caddy.</li>
            <li> All the winter dry skin bumps are gone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read reviews where people say they couldn&#x27;t get the sponge to dry, but I&#x27;ve had no problems whatsoever.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend started using this and because it does not come with a hook to hang and dry it started smelling and as soon as he saw some mold growing he threw it away.</li>
            <li> so I could hang it up to dry.</li>
            <li> Let it dry</li>
            <li> so I could hang it to dry.</li>
            <li> It also seems to have helped with my KP, in addition to using African black soap.</li>
            <li> My leg&#x27;s are always very dry</li>
            <li> My skin gets very dry.</li>
            <li> Wish it were a little bigger</li>
            <li> I wish it were a little bigger.</li>
            <li> For the price I was hoping it would last a little while.</li>
            <li> Most exfoliating products, scrubs, loofahs, brushes even shaving all make the skin on my arms and legs itch so bad that I have to apply cortisone cream.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last, but no sponge lasts forever.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and spongy (duh)</li>
            <li> Could not really tell the difference between sides when using.</li>
            <li> There was absolutely no benefit to this &amp;#34;sponge&amp;#34; that felt like I was washing up with a plastic chew toy.</li>
            <li> there are a few big selling</li>
            <li> (My grandmother sits hers in an empty soap dish.)  </li>
            <li> Once it is wet it softens up.  </li>
            <li> I bought it based on the reviews I read, and  I&#x27;m not really impress by it.</li>
            <li> when wet but still firm enough to be held in one&#x27;s hand.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s became very soft that it can be hard to massaging your body with it!</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other ones and they are stiffer anyways.  </li>
            <li> have been following the directions and have been using it for the past week.</li>
            <li> This Konjak sponge tends to disintegrate and fall apart before my other Konjak sponges.</li>
            <li> May be a little expensive but definately worth trying.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be surprised like I was that it arrives very hard.  </li>
            <li> Used it and seriously found it to be a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I find I use half of the amount of body wash compared to other bath puffs, wash clothes, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I used to use those hard sponges on the stick to scratch my back.</li>
            <li> Just a small amount of liquid body soap goes an amazingly long way.  </li>
            <li> It felt delicate, but it stood up to multiple washings.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I will never own another type/brand of sponge outside of Konjac!</li>
            <li> Use the heel of your palm to press the water out from one end down - as if pressing out pizza dough.</li>
            <li> I often use them to remove my makeup without any other cleanser (or with a little coconut or Rosehip oil).</li>
            <li> but the sponge has made them less flaky looking.</li>
            <li> and sometimes it&#x27;s slightly damp, but either way there has been no problem with it.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I use less body wash</li>
            <li> However, it ROCKS as a face sponge which is why I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars even though it was at first a bit disappointing since it didn&#x27;t do what I bought it for (otherwise it would have been 5).</li>
            <li> I have to hold it tight so it will not skips from my hands du to</li>
            <li> dry skin on my knees and elbows are slowly getting smoother.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for little over a month now.</li>
            <li> I just wish it lated a little longer.</li>
            <li> and you use so little soap.</li>
            <li> A little bit pricey</li>
            <li> Not many other sponges can say that.</li>
            <li> Still, they are less expensive than other exfoliating, massaging cleansing tools such as sonic brushes.</li>
            <li> Totally waste of money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks and my skin is a lot smoother.</li>
            <li> but I never recommend a product I do not personally enjoy.</li>
            <li> Exfoliation doesn&#x27;t need to be harsh</li>
            <li> I have been using Konjac sponges for a few months now.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, the sponge started to disintegrate.  </li>
            <li> Exfoliates without being harsh.</li>
            <li> In the bag, I thought it was going to be too hard, but once it got wet it became the body sponge I have been searching for!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little gelatinous, but very little body wash is required.</li>
            <li> One of my friends got a small bump on her shoulder for the past few weeks.</li>
            <li> Makes lots of suds with very little soap.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m really not sure what all the ridges are about.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too small</li>
            <li> I am not sure which side of the sponge you are supposed to use against the skin and which you place in the hand</li>
            <li> I have been using these konjac sponges for the past year or so</li>
            <li> Yes, it works, but no better than a wash cloth.  </li>
            <li> The sponges are way too small</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I have tried at least a half dozen body sponges -- some are too hard, some deteriorate after 2 weeks; some don&#x27;t find my hand well.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes hard to hold onto in shower...</li>
            <li> I use it on my face and it takes off all my makeup - I can scrub hard but it doesn&#x27;t hurt my skin at all.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get too hard.</li>
            <li> I was not thrilled w/ this product and probably would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I see a few other reviewers here were disappointed because it arrived moist, but it doesn&#x27;t affect the product.</li>
            <li> you use VERY little soap - like a drop so you can indulge in some expensive stuff cause it lasts forever.&lt;br</li>
            <li> item came wet and moldy also had a bad smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced a shower/bath sponge like this one before.  </li>
            <li> Was very uncomfortable and hard to use</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the cleaning power of Konjac sponges until I tried them.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but for the price figured I could give it a try.</li>
            <li> but was I wrong.</li>
            <li> Sorry .</li>
            <li> Was hoping it would exfoliate my skin, but sadly it does not.</li>
            <li> At the end, I find it really expensive for what it is.</li>
            <li> up in one week is virtually useless.  </li>
            <li> Sorry to have to report that😳</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed.  </li>
            <li> It was horrible and painful, it seems like every time i would scratch my back</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great Sponge.. Sometimes hard to hold onto in shower...I already ordered another one...Probably a perfect sponge for a bath!</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with my Konjac sponge.  I have always used a synthetic sponge that is a similar shape, but they are getting more difficult to find.  The last ones I have gotten from Amazon were falling apart quickly.  I really, really like the Konjac sponge. It feels soft but sturdy - and I love knowing that it is made from natural fibers.  Just seems better for the environment . It is higher priced than the synthetic sponges I had been buying - but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely excellent little body sponge. Ever since i bought it i use it every time, been over a month now and it is like new still. When wet it becomes soft, actually holds my body wash quite well and lots of foam! I just bought another of My Konjac sponge (Red clay) but didn&#x27;t use it yet. Very satisfied and will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Coolest sponge out there! I use this for my newborn, who has skin sensitivities, and the sponge is so gentle!</li>
            <li> I wish they had a string loop to be able to hang these and allow dry. Kind of ugly sticking them out on our bathroom counter after each shower so they can dry (as the instructions state you need to).</li>
            <li> Really like this. Could not really tell the difference between sides when using. Wish it were a little bigger</li>
            <li> Not really crazy about it.  Most of the other reviewers had it correct.  Used this product for a week, following directions for drying it.  It&#x27;s already started to tear in the ridges.  It will follow apart sooner than it was advertised, I  believe.  Other than that, it does feel nice.  The face product is much better.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this to be anything special. It&#x27;s kind of small. I didn&#x27;t feel it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> Nice sponge, my boyfriend say he likes it, kinda expensive though.</li>
            <li> This might be my most favorite beauty product ever. And I don&#x27;t even know why. I have been using this for little over a month now. I loved the idea of it because when you are done with it you can throw it in the compost and since it&#x27;s a natural root - I feel like it&#x27;s better for the environment. Hey Earthy Crunchy CA-er here. I use it on my face and it takes off all my makeup - I can scrub hard but it doesn&#x27;t hurt my skin at all. It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> great for bath time for toddlers&lt;br /&gt;soft on their skin&lt;br /&gt;will dry out well and no odor&lt;br /&gt;with contact with water springs back like new</li>
            <li> I have tried at least a half dozen body sponges -- some are too hard, some deteriorate after 2 weeks; some don&#x27;t find my hand well.  This one is great!  In the bag, I thought it was going to be too hard, but once it got wet it became the body sponge I have been searching for!  It has just the right texture to be only mildly abrasive -- just the right amount for a good body wash.  Just a small amount of liquid body soap goes an amazingly long way.  It rinses easily and dries out quickly.  Bottom line:  I Love It!</li>
            <li> So far, so good!  Love the way it feels on my skin, and have noticed a decrease in oiliness!</li>
            <li> Will Buy it over an over all the time</li>
            <li> i bought this for bathing my baby thinking it is soft and clean but have mold and smell after using it about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Used it and seriously found it to be a complete waste of money. There was absolutely no benefit to this &amp;#34;sponge&amp;#34; that felt like I was washing up with a plastic chew toy.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the cleaning power of Konjac sponges until I tried them. Once I did I was hooked and regularly use both the facial and body sponges. This is the \\&quot;plain\\&quot; sponge and offers gentle cleansing with or without soap. It really extends the life of your bar soap. You need very little to get and maintain a lather which is lovely. Even without soap you get a nice clean feeling all over which I wasn&#x27;t sure was entirely possible. It fits comfortably in your hand and is large enough to get the job done. I far prefer the Konjac sponge to a regular shower pouf/loofah. Another reason why I think this product is fantastic is how long lasting it is. With the proper care this sponge can easily last 3-4 months. All you have to do to maximize its longevity is to gently press the water out of it between your hands (wringing it will cause it to deteriorate much faster) and allow it to air dry between uses. I let it dry out on one of the wire racks of our shower caddy. When it starts to tear apart a bit, you know its time to compost or toss it. Economical and gentle for sure. I have also tried it in the french clay version and love that one even more. Great product!</li>
            <li> It is very soft but is very effective.  My leg&#x27;s are always very dry but the sponge has made them less flaky looking.</li>
            <li> Konjac is amazing!!! First, they last a long time without tearing and you can sanitize them, which is a huge plus!!!! Oh, and did I say they are all natural?!  I use these on my little ones, as they have super sensitive skin....I find they help with their skin issues :)  I definitely think they are worth the price and will purchase again! :)</li>
            <li> This particular Konjac sponge feels wonderful.  I&#x27;ve been trying to come up with a way to describe it and the best I&#x27;ve  come up with is that it&#x27;s squishy like a marshmallow, but holds together and is gently exfoliating.  My sensitive skin loves it.  This one is big enough to use on the whole body.  I wouldn&#x27;t bother buying the smaller facial ones.  I&#x27;ve tried other ones and they are stiffer anyways.  This one will do the job for both face and body.  I will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but for the price figured I could give it a try. It is a really good skin polisher. If you use it regularly it does what it says it does.</li>
            <li> there are a few big selling points.&lt;br /&gt;1. you use VERY little soap - like a drop so you can indulge in some expensive stuff cause it lasts forever.&lt;br /&gt;2. you can microwave it to clean it so it doesnt&#x27; get  gross quickly.&lt;br /&gt;3. it really does leave your skin softer, I&#x27;m not sure how but it seems to really exfoliate and yet it just feels very luxurious not rough.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to hold and clean your body with, however it&#x27;s less aggressive than my shower gloves, so I&#x27;m afraid this isn&#x27;t going to be a staple for me.  If you have gentle cleaning needs, BUY it!</li>
            <li> This piece of junk started to ripped off after 3 weeks, torn apart after 1  month.. Cheap material..Totally waste of money</li>
            <li> Their facial sponges are great, this body sponge not so much.  The body sponge was just kind of weird for me.  It was kind of difficult to grip and i&#x27;m really not sure what all the ridges are about.  The main issue was the lack of exfoliation, I just really didn&#x27;t think this sponge was doing anything to really get my skin clean.  It just sort of floated above the suds created by the body wash.  Again, their face sponges are amazing but this product was a miss.</li>
            <li> My skin gets very dry. Most exfoliating products, scrubs, loofahs, brushes even shaving all make the skin on my arms and legs itch so bad that I have to apply cortisone cream.  So far this sponge has left my skin feeling soft and has removed the dryness.  Very happy.</li>
            <li> I love it so much..  Its makes my skin smoother than when use scraping gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that i didn&#x27;t love about this sponge, when u put it in the water it&#x27;s became very soft that it can be hard to massaging your body with it! I have to hold it tight so it will not skips from my hands du to it&#x27;s softness</li>
            <li> Timely receipt of purchased item; it&#x27;s a different sponge than what I&#x27;ve ever used before. It&#x27;s a little gelatinous, but very little body wash is required. After use it does dry out but rehydrates easily in water. I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> I really like this sponge - it lathers up easily, helps rinse your face off and leaves your skin very soft.  It works great with all types of cleansers, bars and liquids alike.  Glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t dislike it - but I haven&#x27;t felt it does very much for my skin....have been following the directions and have been using it for the past week. I&#x27;ll continue to use it until it starts to deteriorate, but at this point I am nit sure if I will get another. Time will tell.</li>
            <li> This sponge is super soft! Even though it looks like a pumice stone in the photos, once you add water it turns into a soft sponge. It felt delicate, but it stood up to multiple washings. It is good at exfoliating, but it is very gentle so I think it’d be perfect for anyone with sensitive skin. It left my skin feeling clean and smooth. I liked the groove son the back because they fit my fingers perfectly and made it easier to hold.  It didn&#x27;t have a string to hang it from, but it was no big deal for me. I put a piece of string on a needle and poked it through the top and tied a knot to make a way to hang it.  It was not a huge sponge so it could have worked for the face too, but I thought it was big enough to use on the whole body.</li>
            <li> It really does not work as a body sponge, for me at least. It&#x27;s too small and it&#x27;s too soft. However, it ROCKS as a face sponge which is why I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars even though it was at first a bit disappointing since it didn&#x27;t do what I bought it for (otherwise it would have been 5). And it&#x27;s cruelty free!</li>
            <li> I started using the sponge as a substitute of soap, especially during winter. I have noticed that my skin has improved a lot, it looks fresh and moisturized. Used it constantly for 2 months, after 3 weeks noticed changes. Recently made the fatal mistake of bringing back soap and my skin got scratchy again. Getting new one!</li>
            <li> I heard about this product from some friends and decided to try it myself. I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks and my skin is a lot smoother. All the winter dry skin bumps are gone.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed the Konjac sponges I have purchased and although they will not last forever you can extend their life by treating them properly - don&#x27;t scrunch them up to get water out. Use the heel of your palm to press the water out from one end down - as if pressing out pizza dough. I do wish this one had a hanging string.</li>
            <li> My new sponge go to! Super soft, leaves skin feeling great, great lather! Wish there were bigger sizes, but I love it!</li>
            <li> This is so much better than the net sponges.  It lathers great and leaves your skin feeling really smooth. I think it makes my moisturizer better too.  Will definitely buy another when needed.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and this is the softest sponge of any kind that touched my skin and felt good about it.</li>
            <li> This sponge is very gentle and it saves a lot of soap. I would buy this sponge for friends as a gift.</li>
            <li> Really love this product ~ I bought it after reading all the great reviews. I was instantly amazed by the texture and it actually made washing my face FUN! I then ordered more to be shipped out as gifts!</li>
            <li> Love this for full body cleansing. Soft with decent exfoliation. I just wish it lated a little longer. This Konjak sponge tends to disintegrate and fall apart before my other Konjak sponges.</li>
            <li> Always consistent product, works great, my husband swears by this and the facial konjac sponge. I would say we order a new one every 4-8 weeks.</li>
            <li> I ordered (for the first time) a bath and a face sponge.  They feel great on your skin, but it&#x27;s an adjustment to not be using any soap or cleanser.  That being said, I do think they are cleansing only because I &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; clean afterwards, and besides, I know there cannot be any soap residue.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these sponges.  I was using a small one from Boscia on my face that costs much, much more.  I had no idea you could get these in a larger size for using on your entire body.  I started looking because my grandmother has super sensitive, dry skin.  I gave her some fabulous cleansing shower oil which helped, but it wouldn&#x27;t lather with a washcloth and the washcloth was too harsh.  So when I found these sponges, I crossed my fingers and ordered one to try.  Right away I fell in love.  It&#x27;s super soft and everything lathers well with it.  I&#x27;ve used it with bar soap, shower gels and my beloved L&#x27;Occitane shower oil.  It&#x27;s wonderful with all of them.  It gets you clean and it&#x27;s gentle enough for your most sensitive areas.  So, then I ordered one for my grandmother and she thinks it&#x27;s the best thing in the world.  Then I told my mom &amp; co-worker about them and they&#x27;re hooked, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read reviews where people say they couldn&#x27;t get the sponge to dry, but I&#x27;ve had no problems whatsoever. I just squeeze the water out and sit it on the counter.  (My grandmother sits hers in an empty soap dish.)  Sometimes it&#x27;s completely dry by the next days shower and sometimes it&#x27;s slightly damp, but either way there has been no problem with it.  I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last, but no sponge lasts forever.  Will update my review if I see any problems or finally wear mine out so I can give a timetable, but so far....I love it and am ordering more so I have them when I need them.</li>
            <li> My Konjac Sponge arrived promptly and was perfectly packaged. It&#x27;s soft and spongy (duh) when wet but still firm enough to be held in one&#x27;s hand. I am already using a Konjac sponge for my face. The fact that the  sponge increases the skin&#x27;s alkalinity is what interested me in getting the body wave sponge. I like this better than the net scrubber that I was using.</li>
            <li> i am on my second order for this sponge.  I use a different one for my face, but this is fabulous for my body.  it lasted two months, which is a short time, but I still love it so much.  I feel like I use less body wash and it makes so many suds.  Feels soft yet exfoliating.  Great discovery. Fast service.</li>
            <li> I love this sponge. I have really sensitive skin, and this is the only product I&#x27;ve found that exfoliates my skin without making me turn bright red. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It works so well for my secetive skin and you use so little soap.</li>
            <li> This is the best sponge on the market for people with sensitive skin. I have tried everything. This is the BEST!!</li>
            <li> One of the best things that you can use on your body, and it is made from natural fibers</li>
            <li> This is so soft when wet, suds up nicely, but really doesn&#x27;t exfoliate much. I&#x27;m using it on my toddlers occasionally or on my face... And for that it&#x27;s good. I don&#x27;t understand why all the amazing reviews. It&#x27;s also not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Love the texture and the scent. Lasts longer than I anticipated. A little bit pricey but I haven&#x27;t seen anything else like it.</li>
            <li> Kids love it!  Seems as if this thing will last for quite some time.  Soft enough for my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using the body sponge for two weeks now, and see a significant difference on my skin. When I used loofah, shower puff, or wash towel in the past, they all made my skin feel dry as if stripped of from my own body oil, especially during winter time.. but since I use &#x27;my konjac sponge&#x27; my skin feel softer and more supple...and it&#x27;s a PLUS since it&#x27;s natural eco-friendly,too. I love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want try and see how the face sponge do to my face...</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product - I love it!! I am in my mid 60&#x27;s and in excellent health but my skin is getting older. I have used loofah sponges which feel more abrasive than this sponge and in fact I was really skeptical that this was going to be better than any loofah pad but was I wrong.This sponge has really improved the condition of my skin! The skin is tighter and smoother. I had a healed sore on my lower leg that was just not letting the skin return to normal but I have only been using this sponge for 1 week and already the skin is once again looking healthy, obviously this promotes good circulation. I would recommend this to anyone of any age!!</li>
            <li> This sponge suds really well. I don&#x27;t know if I noticed my skin feeling softer.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend started using this and because it does not come with a hook to hang and dry it started smelling and as soon as he saw some mold growing he threw it away. thank god Amazon has a great return policy!</li>
            <li> Great product! Exfoliates super gently, while effectively. My skin feels very clean afterwards. Will repurchase.</li>
            <li> I love this body sponge! The wave shape and texture feel great against my skin and have an exfoliating, cleaning aspect to it. My skin feel so clean and fresh after using it!</li>
            <li> This would have had 5 stars if it had a hang string so I could hang it up to dry. Otherwise, great size for the price!</li>
            <li> I used this 2 times during shower but both the times it didn&#x27;t help me get rid of dirt on my body . I am back to my bodyshop gloves. But i love the konjac sponge for face though. This one-No. Sorry . Maybe its suitable for a child or a baby&#x27;s skin only.</li>
            <li> This sponge is SO amazing!! It has completely replaced my regular Puffy loofa and it works SO much better. It&#x27;s so soft on my skin and I love the way it cleanses! I swear it makes me feel cleaner and is just the right size for me, as a woman. The ridges in it make it super easy to hold, and I will definitely be purchasing another once this one is done. HIGHLY recommend. Even my husband tried it and loves it. You barely have to use any soap at all because it lathers up so nicely. PLUS it&#x27;s great for your skin, even without soap! I&#x27;ve seen significant improvement in the dryness of my skin since using this item.</li>
            <li> The best konjac sponge that I have ever used! My daughter loves it! Best for delicate skin!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for everybody. Great for my daughter. It doesn&#x27;t get too hard. It&#x27;s soft enough and it dries fast</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and the mesh pouf I had was starting to irritate my skin. This sponge is very soft and perfect for my skin. It is soft enough to use on my face. Fantastic.</li>
            <li> did not work as good as I would have liked</li>
            <li> I like it a lot and it works well.  I wish it were a little bigger.</li>
            <li> I love this! ! The perfect size!!! ♡ my skin is so soft</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time tonight and I fell in love with it! All I had to do was get it wet, use soap and just enjoy! Thanks!</li>
            <li> If you love the My Konjac facial sponges, you&#x27;ll love the body sponge. I find that this sponge offers the perfect amount of exfoliation without being too harsh, which can be the case with some sponges. It&#x27;s extremely easy to use, and it will work with all sorts of body washes, from your general foaming types and the kind with exfoliators in it. I haven&#x27;t tried it with bar soap, though I don&#x27;t see why it wouldn&#x27;t work with that, too.</li>
            <li> It was nice for a week, then it started deteriorating... It&#x27;s also completely non-exfoliating (as in way too soft and gentle - for a guy at least).</li>
            <li> Was hoping it would exfoliate my skin, but sadly it does not. It&#x27;s way too soft and does not hold body wash.</li>
            <li> WHEN YOU USE THIS SPONGE FOR YOUR BODY IN THE SHOWER YOU WILL CLEAN AND EXFOLIATE AT THE SAME TIME WITHOUT HAVING TO EXFOLIATE AND THEN WASH WITH 2 DIFFERENT PRODUCTS.... THE SPONGE IS LONG LASTING AND FEELS WONDERUL ON YOUR SKIN...MY HUSBAND AND I EACH HAVE ONE... MY SKIN FEELS VERY SOFT AND MY BODY OILS DO A BETTER JOB!!!! I AM HAPPY WITH THE SPONGES AND THE PRICES ARE GREAT...I HAVE SOME AS BACKUPS AND WHEN MY KIDS VISIT THEY STEAL THEM!!!!</li>
            <li> The sponge feels so soft and I love the fact that it exfoliates.  The whole line of Konjac Sponge is good for my skin, I love the face sponge and body sponge!  Love the products, and love the price!</li>
            <li> I am  a new user to the Konjac sponges.This is sponge 2 of 3 I purchased. I adore them! They are perfect and do not make you feel like you&#x27;ve just used sandpaper on your skin. They last for months with proper care and drying. I am hooked.</li>
            <li> item came wet and moldy also had a bad smell. i did&#x27;nt have the time to call so i just threw it in the trash. do not buy.</li>
            <li> I wish this would have come w/ some type of string to hang for easier drying. I was not thrilled w/ this product and probably would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have recently (in the past couple of months) been introduced to Konjac sponges and I am glad that I was. I started out with the facial sponges and fell in love. I tried out this same companies Charcoal facial sponge and was so impressed with it that when I was given the chance to try out the body sponge, I absolutely had to have it. Do you know how hard it is to clean your face with a loofah? When I tried the facial sponge, I had no clue how impressed with it I would be. My face was so soft and that said, I had high expectations for the body sponge. I am pleased that my expectations were met and I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled. This is a pretty large sponge which makes it great for cleaning your whole body. You don&#x27;t have to use too much soap with it because it is great at absorbing and suds up nicely. Put it in the water, let it get soft and scrub away. It exfoliates so well that when I get out of the tub or shower, I can&#x27;t help but feel how soft my skin is. Let it dry and it&#x27;s ready for your next use. This works so much better than a rough washcloth or a loofah that falls apart. I couldn&#x27;t be more impressed and will definitely be purchasing more sponges from this company in the future! Not to mention I was very impressed with their customer service.</li>
            <li> The body sponge easily and quickly absorbs in water it feels incredible on my skin and since i have eczema it never scratched my skin nor given my skin any rashes. The body sponge gently massage my skin and smooths out all the dry rough spots instantly the sponge is very quick to clean simply rinse, squeeze and let it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the thickness of the body sponge and it never loses its thickness unlike other body sponges i had purchased after a few use and it get flat. Love what this body sponge done given me amazing results on my skin texture</li>
            <li> I really love Konjac they are soft, and have a magnificent absorbency quality, is a keeper TR</li>
            <li> absolutely my favorite body sponge  I received this product in exchange for a honest review. All my reviews are 100% my personal opinion.</li>
            <li> MY KONJAC SPONGE 100% Natural Fiber Konjac Original Six Wave Body Sponge&lt;br /&gt;-More often than not, original is usually the best, I mean that&#x27;s what makes them so popular right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin that produces pimple in the presence of make up/moisturizer/ sunscreen residues. This sponge helps me to chased them away.&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, and I think my face agrees w me, this is the best My Konjac Sponge, as it is not only cleansing but moisturizing my skin too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned in other reviews of this product line; I took the risk, and it&#x27;s the risk worth taking!&lt;br /&gt;My $8 gives me pimple free face :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times, but it seems to be doing a good job.</li>
            <li> I love it!!! I will definitely buy this product again and recommend it to my friends! Please check it out!</li>
            <li> When you first get the sponge it will be hard and coarse, but when you wet it the feel becomes soft and light, like a marshmallow! The skin exfoliation is gentle, and you will feel as if your skin is cleaner than when you use a regular bath puff or washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To clean and sanitize you can place the sponge in a bowl of water, then into the microwave for about one minute. You should do this about every two weeks or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I am not sure which side of the sponge you are supposed to use against the skin and which you place in the hand but I prefer to use the smooth edge on my skin and place the waved edge in my hand. My fingers fit into the grooves perfectly and the sponge does not slip out of my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another cool feature about this sponge is that your body wash will go a lot further! I find I use half of the amount of body wash compared to other bath puffs, wash clothes, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never would have found the Konjac Sponge on my own and thankfully was sent this sponge for review on my blog but I never recommend a product I do not personally enjoy.</li>
            <li> Very soft and perfect for bathing our elderly mother.</li>
            <li> This is the crappiest sponge I ever used. I bought it a month ago and I generally use it 3-4 times a week. After my 3rd use, the sponge had a crack in it. And then it&#x27;s a slippery slope from then on. Every time I use it, the crack just grows bigger and bigger and the sponge crumbles. Now there&#x27;s a big hole in my sponge. I get sponge crumble all over me when I shower, very pleasant. Today I finally decide to trash that thing. I will not buy this product again nor will I recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great. I enjoy using this sponge. It is very gentle and good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be surprised like I was that it arrives very hard.  Once it is wet it softens up.  I am still using one that I already had but haven&#x27;t been able to find a replacement when and if it dies out.  This was much more expensive than the old type I had so hopefully it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This Konjac sponge is great for the shower. Again, love the way it makes me feel so much cleaner! I can&#x27;t get enough of them!!!</li>
            <li> Really fantastic product! Especially good for washing the face. Unique and outstanding. It seems to be very long lasting as well. May be a little expensive but definately worth trying.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I could love My Konjac Sponge anymore and then I found the body sponge. This thing is awesome and I love it so much more than any other sponge I have used. It&#x27;s so soft yet it really cleans and exfoliates all parts of the body. I love using it on my shoulders and upper back because it seems like it stays the driest and it makes the skin feel so much better without having to do so much work. I also love the fact this sponge is 100% natural and even biodegradable. Not many other sponges can say that.</li>
            <li> The last sponge I bought fell apart and almost disintegrated after three weeks. For this price I don&#x27;t feel it should have deteriorated that quickly.</li>
            <li> Awesome sponge! It is very gentle and non-abrasive. It also seems to have helped with my KP, in addition to using African black soap. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Used this sponge for 2 weeks already to bath a newborn. Sponge is soft, non abrasive and holds water well.</li>
            <li> The sponge fell apart after a week of use, mild use at that. I&#x27;m a fan of the facial sponge and may continue to use those items but I will not give this another try.</li>
            <li> This is an interesting product to have and if you don&#x27;t like rough loofas and have sensitive dry skin like me then this is a perfect gadget for your bathing needs. It is soft and glides on the body seamlessly. Exfoliation doesn&#x27;t need to be harsh so I like it more this way, achieving perfection whilst not harming the biggest organ of our body - skin. Moreover, it is an all natural product that is safe for adults and for children. If you are worried about bacterial infestation, you can always microwave this before using for 3 minutes, making sure you microwave both sides up. I love doing this! The aroma just fills the kitchen. Overall, it works for any skin type, you can put a little bit soap on it or not (if you&#x27;re planning to have a quick shower) and it is safe for the environment when you&#x27;re done with it.</li>
            <li> This is a great Konjac Sponge for the body and face. It is a little bigger than my palm and feels nice to use in the shower. I love the gentle exfoliation and cleansing from Konjac sponges. I often use them to remove my makeup without any other cleanser (or with a little coconut or Rosehip oil). I have been using Konjac sponges for a few months now. My only issue is they don&#x27;t last as long as I would like, after a couple months they start to fall apart. Still, they are less expensive than other exfoliating, massaging cleansing tools such as sonic brushes. I find the larger sized sponges such as this one last a little longer than the smaller round facial sponges.</li>
            <li> Great size, lathers well and feels good on the skin. The only reason I can not give it 5 stars is that it does not come with a string to allow one to hang it in the shower.</li>
            <li> More like a sponge. It says exfoliate, but there is not exfoliating at all. If you like sponge you will love this, but if you like something a little scratchy this is not for you.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soft and silky while in the shower, but even at half the price I paid, $12.99, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. It deteriorates too quickly, shrivels up to almost nothing after several uses.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to this product.  However, after a little over a week of normal use I have large tears in the sponge on the side with the grooves.  Feel like it&#x27;s only a matter of time that it falls apart.  For the price I was hoping it would last a little while.</li>
            <li> Love Konjac Sponges!... But don&#x27;t think it will last as long as there was no string and cannot hang it up to dry.</li>
            <li> Love this sponge but wish they were not so expensive.</li>
            <li> Not the best out there. It is way softer than my normal konjac sponge ,and not in a good way.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Have to replace my soon.  Will buy again</li>
            <li> Really soft, durable, and only takes a small amount of soap to get a great lather.</li>
            <li> I bought it based on the reviews I read, and  I&#x27;m not really impress by it. At the end, I find it really expensive for what it is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced a shower/bath sponge like this one before.  It&#x27;s exfoliating, while still soft and the amount of soap you have to use will save $ because the tiniest amount of soap on this sponge for some reason goes a long, long way.  I will now only use these from now on. My husband wants one now as well.</li>
            <li> Wish this had a string so I could hang it to dry.</li>
            <li> So the first thing I noted when I opened the package, was that it was wet. Fear not, folks - it is supposed to be that way. I see a few other reviewers here were disappointed because it arrived moist, but it doesn&#x27;t affect the product. I do like this sponge and got rid of my other sponges and only use this. I don&#x27;t think its abrasive enough to be used as a heavy duty exfoliating scrub, but it is so gentle that I will continue to use it in conjunction with another product for exfoliation. It lathers up very easily, and I use it with natural soaps that are infused with essential oils. It is gentle enough that I can see myself using it on my face, but I don&#x27;t since I use this sponge to clean my other body parts and that&#x27;s just foul. Maybe in the future I&#x27;ll purchase another dedicated for my face. My only problem with this sponge is that no matter how hard I try, I can&#x27;t totally clean the sponge in between uses. This could be since my soap uses a lot of oils, but I hold the sponge under running water for a long time and it will forever retain some soapiness. This isn&#x27;t a massive problem, but I can see the life of the sponge being reduced if it can&#x27;t be thoroughly cleaned. But even if that happens, the cost of the sponge is low enough and the performance is good enough that it will justify repeat purchases for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because Amazon recommended to buy it with my Konjac sponge for face. I read a lot of reviews about it and i decided to give it a try. I had very itchy back and I used to use those hard sponges on the stick to scratch my back. It was horrible and painful, it seems like every time i would scratch my back it would itch more and hurt more from that harsh sponge...so i decided to give it a try and buy this Konjac sponge for body. When i got it, i washed with it for 3 days and already my back stopped itching..It soaps really nice and my skin became really soft and less bumpy around my arms and my back. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 2 weeks and I love it.. My husband even surprised when i don&#x27;t ask him any more to itch my back...:) I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product. The only one thing that this sponge need is a string to hang it, but otherwise it is a very good sponge to have if you have dry and itchy skin...</li>
            <li> I liked the sponge and really felt my skin even feels smoother since using it.&lt;br /&gt;Two issues I don&#x27;t like, the size is too small , needs to be larger and after only&lt;br /&gt;a week using daily it&#x27;s about to fall a part!!! What&#x27;s up with that, ?a sponge that&lt;br /&gt;tears up in one week is virtually useless.  Sorry to have to report that😳</li>
            <li> A decent sponge but shrinks considerably when it dries.</li>
            <li> Love it and plan on reordering! It is much better than any sponge I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with the Konjac facial sponge, which I love; however, this doesn&#x27;t hold up as well.  After a few weeks, the sponge started to disintegrate.  I think I will just buy another facial sponge to use separately.</li>
            <li> Awesome body sponge, just a little soap goes a long way. Leaves my skin feeling soft and silky. Exfoliates without being harsh. Very nice sponge!!!</li>
            <li> If you want to truly spoil yourself buy this sponge for an experience of luxurious lather. You need very little liquid body cleanser to clean your whole body. I like using LUSH&#x27;s Happy Hippy shower gel with this sponge. This is a sponge I can recommend to everyone because it is so soft and gentle yet seems to exfoliate the skin too. It is made from konnyaku potatoes. It is also a totally natural product that deep cleanses the skin. Once you use this you will not want to shower without it. The sponge feels soft on your skin. Once you try one of the My Konjac sponges you will want to try them all. I also highly recommend the bamboo charcoal facial Konjac sponge with works great on oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sponge in exchange for a review. This review is my honest opinion. How did I live without these sponges? They are fantastic.</li>
            <li> A really good quality sponge which can be used for months! and it&#x27;s worth the money! Really long lasting! I love to use this instead of my regular loofah for shower.</li>
            <li> I have been using these konjac sponges for the past year or so and I&#x27;m hooked.  My konjac sponge makes shower time luxurious, and leaves my skin so soft. Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Yes, it works, but no better than a wash cloth.  I&#x27;m not impressed.  The sponges are way too small and I was expecting something bigger.</li>
            <li> Great product and super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I use it everyday! It makes my skin soft; it&#x27;s great for the whole body and face. Great product to have in the shower.</li>
            <li> I was searching for good sponge for my baby as he got sensitive skin, until I found this product and tried it on him. IT worked SO great, his skin felt softer after bath, and it exfoliate too! I can&#x27;t find any better product out there. Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it.  I will need to buy more.  I really like how my skin feels.</li>
            <li> The best sponge I have ever used.  Perfect mixture of abrasiveness and softness to feel really clean.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to everyone that bathes!</li>
            <li> Best sponge I&#x27;ve ever owned... I will never own another type/brand of sponge outside of Konjac!</li>
            <li> LOVE! LOVE! LOVE!&lt;br /&gt;My dry skin on my knees and elbows are slowly getting smoother. I have one for my face too. I will never use anything else!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this brand. I&#x27;ve actually found that it produces a lather much better than the everyday plastic pouf. The feeling might take some getting used to at first but, I feel that it cleans much better. It gently exfoliates so well that you may not even notice that it has because your skin is absolutely left without any signs of irritation. However,my tattoos look fresher since I started using them which means it is exfoliating in someway! Reasons I like this: Biodegradable/Compostable, Natural, Produces a Thick Dense Lather, Can be Sanitized,Dye Free, Gentle.</li>
            <li> I was just hoping for a soft exfoliating bath sponge. I found it, and it really does make my skin feel smoother. I will keep on buying this product.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of these before when I ordered the first time, but I decided to try it.  I love it.  I have sensitive skin and this product, although it is extremely soft once it is wet, really does gently exfoliate without irritation.  If you use it with shower gel, or a gentle soap, you get a luxurious lather for a very nice shower.  I recently ordered another for myself, and one for my best friend.  She had never heard of it and I knew she would love it, too.  Highly recommend this product and the seller.</li>
            <li> Best sponge I have ever used. Makes lots of suds with very little soap.</li>
            <li> Was very uncomfortable and hard to use</li>
            <li> I love this product! I used to wash my body with regular shower puff and sometimes it scratched my skin because it is too rough. But this product is totally different. It is smooth on the skin, it doesn&#x27;t dry the skin, and also I only need to put a little soap when I use it to take shower. :)&lt;br /&gt;I also introduced this product to some friends. One of my friends got a small bump on her shoulder for the past few weeks. After she used this konjac sponge to take shower for 3 days, she noticed that the bump is gone. Apparently it is totally true that this body bath sponge helps circulate the blood flow.&lt;br /&gt;This sponge is not just a sponge, it is a magic sponge!</li>
            <li> the sponge is really soft but still works the job. i don&#x27;t normally use bath sponge for bath just because I always think the sponge is not clean enough (soap residue), but not this sponge. it&#x27;s very easy to clean and hang dry.&lt;br /&gt;very good product. LOVE it.</li>
