            <li>I love this product and buying this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I am not sensitive to many ingredients, so I can&#x27;t speak to its hypoallergenic nature, but for attractiveness, effectiveness, and ease of application, this stuff is the best.  </li>

            <li>This begin by talking about how easy this product is to apply.  </li>
            <li>It comes off easy and becomes ineffective when I sweat.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to locate the exact product that my Dermatologist suggested to me.  </li>
            <li>i looked for this product , in this size , all over town, and coun&#x27;t fine it .  </li>
            <li>Smoothes out wrinkles and fine lines and makes for a smooth surface to apply makeup.  </li>
            <li>This product was recommended by my Dermatologist...if you apply it while your skin is damp on your face it goes on smoothly and then does just as it says...</li>
            <li>This product redeem the sun protection for me, even though dense and creamy it vanishes when applied and leaves a smooth feel to it.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena makes absolutely the best sunblock, hands down.  </li>
            <li>Its applies instantly and when I buy it in this packet deal, I feel very confident that I&#x27;m getting my moneys worth.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s the best stuff out there for sensitive skin - much gentler than other brands.</li>

            <li>;)</li>
            <li>finally, a sunscreen that is light on my skin, and doesn&#x27;t make me break out!</li>
            <li>Neutrogena sheer dry-touch is awesome at coverage without making me feel like I&#x27;m wearing badly caked kabuki makeup :)  </li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>

            <li>Also it really stings when it runs into my eyes.</li>
            <li>In addition, there just isn&#x27;t much sunblock cream in each</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s about half the price :)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Leaves a little bit of white residue if not rubbed in enough, but is great for sensitive skin and the whole family.</li>
            <li>It protects you and won&#x27;t live you feeling sticky.</li>
            <li>These packs are typically sold at Costco and we were excited to see them on Amazon and PRIME eligible.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin I wouldn&#x27;t use it on your face.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Neutrogena Broad Spectrum Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch 4 Pack at Costco for $13.99 on 7/15/13, which was much cheaper than Amazon&#x27;s price of $22.99.</li>
            <li>Also, the bottles are so small even the large bottles don&#x27;t have much sunscreen in them.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling soft and definitely works well.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry Touch only gets 4 stars instead of 5 because it is thick, which makes it hard to apply.  </li>
            <li> As I mowed the lawn, I noticed that dust and small particles were not sticking to my skin as they often do when I&#x27;m wearing a sunscreen.&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is an awesome deal - two full size sunblocks and two travel-sized tubes for your purse/bag.  Neutrogena makes absolutely the best sunblock, hands down.  I&#x27;ve been to the Caribbean, Mexico, and Central America several times and have not gotten burned once using their products.  Also, it&#x27;s the best stuff out there for sensitive skin - much gentler than other brands.</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen protection I will buy. Neutrogena is easy to apply, blends in quickly, and smells nice. It leaves your skin feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Good sunscreen not greasy but runs on your face when you sweat and gets in your eyes.  Also, the bottles are so small even the large bottles don&#x27;t have much sunscreen in them.</li>
            <li> Good product. fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I trust on my face; I typically break out into a rash with other brands.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena is the best sunscreen and th eprice is unbeatable.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff but my boyfriend has issues with it peeling off on his facial hair when he uses it on his face.</li>
            <li> got it for the wife and she loves it if she is happy im happy cant give a honest reveiw it wasnt for me</li>
            <li> Its applies instantly and when I buy it in this packet deal, I feel very confident that I&#x27;m getting my moneys worth.</li>
            <li> This begin by talking about how easy this product is to apply.  Most sun screens refuse to cover evenly, but this Neutrogena sunscreen rubs in like a lotion with nice even coverage and a pleasant smell.  I never felt like I was wearing a sunscreen at all.  As I mowed the lawn, I noticed that dust and small particles were not sticking to my skin as they often do when I&#x27;m wearing a sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, when I came in for the day, I didn&#x27;t have the urge to immediately shower to get the sticky, stinky stuff off.  And best of all, it offered great protection from the sun.  I have super fair skin and always apply every two hours.  At the end of the afternoon, I showed no trace of being in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend and play to purchase again.</li>
            <li> Terrific product. These packs are typically sold at Costco and we were excited to see them on Amazon and PRIME eligible. Great value and they travel perfectly in our carry on luggage back and forth to Saint Maarten.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Neutrogena Broad Spectrum Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch 4 Pack at Costco for $13.99 on 7/15/13, which was much cheaper than Amazon&#x27;s price of $22.99. Many sunscreens give me a rash but this one does not. If it wasn&#x27;t for the price, I would have given it 5 stars. If you do not have access to a Costco with this product, it may be a good purchase on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I wear sunblock every day because of lupus, and so I know a bit about the stuff ;) Neutrogena sheer dry-touch is awesome at coverage without making me feel like I&#x27;m wearing badly caked kabuki makeup :)  In fact, I think it actually complements my skin tone - how many times have you heard that said about a sunscreen? I am not sensitive to many ingredients, so I can&#x27;t speak to its hypoallergenic nature, but for attractiveness, effectiveness, and ease of application, this stuff is the best.  I echo the reviewer who suggests that you purchase this at Costco - it&#x27;s about half the price :)</li>
            <li> My Dermatologist instructed me to purchase this product.  After checking numerous stores and drug stores for the SPF # 55... My daughter suggested that I look online for the product.  I was thrilled to locate the exact product that my Dermatologist suggested to me.  I am completely satisfied with the product.  Love the way it feel on my skin.  It&#x27;s the BEST! thanks</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen for casual outings. Feels light on my skin and does a great job at blocking sun. But I would not recommend it for outdoor sports where you&#x27;ll be sweating. It comes off easy and becomes ineffective when I sweat. Also it really stings when it runs into my eyes.</li>
            <li> This is the only sunblock that doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes when I sweat.  I am so happy that I found it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry Touch only gets 4 stars instead of 5 because it is thick, which makes it hard to apply.  In addition, there just isn&#x27;t much sunblock cream in each container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I usually use the Neutrogena Sheer Dry Touch on my face and the Banana Boat Ultra Defense on the rest of my body.</li>
            <li> Leaves a little bit of white residue if not rubbed in enough, but is great for sensitive skin and the whole family. The scent is very faint and fresh (if there is any, I&#x27;m still not sure) and it rubs on smoothly. Leaves skin feeling soft and definitely works well. Love it. Such a pleasure to use that I look forward to slathering on my sunscreen all the time.</li>
            <li> We love neutrogena I gave it three stars because it takes a long time to dry and leaves white residue on things you touch with your legs. If you have sensitive skin I wouldn&#x27;t use it on your face.</li>
            <li> I got this for both  my husband and myself after hearing that helioplex is very good for sun protection.  It goes on well and dries without being greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this sunscreen for many years.  It used to work well, but something changed.  I&#x27;m in the ocean daily so it may me related to the ability to repel water.  In any case I can no longer recommend it for use in the water.</li>
            <li> Great value and feels great, not greasy. Works great under makeup. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Received on time. We love it!</li>
            <li> I receiver what I order and it is perfect, I have no complain at all about the product itself or the package. Totally worth it</li>
            <li> finally, a sunscreen that is light on my skin, and doesn&#x27;t make me break out!</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen. Not too greasy and has a pleasant fragrance to it. Works very well.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my Dermatologist...if you apply it while your skin is damp on your face it goes on smoothly and then does just as it says...it dries to the touch.  I have found this product to be the perfect PRIMER before you put on your makeup.  Smoothes out wrinkles and fine lines and makes for a smooth surface to apply makeup.  I apply it every morning and in the evening when I am going out just for the primer effect.</li>
            <li> i looked for this product , in this size , all over town, and coun&#x27;t fine it .  great for travel .  and got it in time for my trip.</li>
            <li> It protects you and won&#x27;t live you feeling sticky. It super easy to apply and not greasy nor does it leave you white as paper when apply in you face.</li>
            <li> Everyone knows that to have radiant skin you need to protect it from the sun, my problem was most of the sunscreens available leave you shinny and with an oily feel which I always hated. This product redeem the sun protection for me, even though dense and creamy it vanishes when applied and leaves a smooth feel to it. Great quality at really affordable price.</li>
            <li> I love this product and buying this sunscreen. I throw the small one in my purse so convenient!</li>
            <li> great product - great price!</li>
