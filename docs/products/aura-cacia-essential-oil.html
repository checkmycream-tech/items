    <ol>
            <li>and she was very happy with it!</li>
            <li>Excellent for headaches or otherwise just freshening the room up.</li>
            <li>Awesome quality.</li>
            <li>Happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li>Excellent quality.  </li>
            <li>Not their best.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing!!</li>
            <li>This smells very good.</li>
            <li>Great product and works wonderfully!</li>
            <li>I find it incredibly relaxing as well as soothing to the skin.  </li>
            <li>A good way to wake up the senses !</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a great all-purpose kitchen spray for wiping up and making your kitchen smell great.  </li>
            <li>Incredible smell and the aroma lasts for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>Worked great for both.</li>
            <li>Loved the product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>Not too thrilled.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfectly nice.  </li>
            <li>I mix it with distilled water and vanilla extract for a nice air freshener and with a diluted unscented dish detergent (eco-friendly) in addition to the vanilla and peppermint</li>
            <li>I used this in a home remedy recipe along with lemon juice and lavender to make mosquito repellant that smells nice and is non-toxic.  </li>
            <li>Great Product will order more  for sure...</li>
            <li>The smell was very very strong.</li>
            <li>but the Peppermint Oil did not have  a very strong smell of Peppermint</li>
            <li>By far the best peppermint oil out there.</li>
            <li>And the best thing is, it&#x27;s all natural and you can&#x27;t OD on it</li>
            <li>Aura oils are one of the best oils to use in general.  </li>
            <li>all the time so wanted some more for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>Two more ingredients are vanilla extract and water.</li>
            <li>so you can use it as many times as you need.</li>
            <li>I just love the smell of peppermint.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product, as it is a very intense scent - way more concentrated than peppermint extract you might cook with.</li>
            <li>I love this product it is very good, need a soothing massage to the scalp i mixed this with my shampoo and it worked wonders</li>
            <li>They have better scents available in my opinion.</li>
            <li>This is a best brand for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy other chipper ones.</li>
            <li>I have ordered many essential oils on line and AuraCacia is a great brand</li>
            <li>Came very quick and was wrapped well.</li>
            <li>It seems to be working fine, and it did arrive on time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many others and it is the most pure.</li>
            <li>this is a great essential oil if you want to feel refreshed and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The mixture of natural oils does a good job on repelling mosquitoes, ticks and fleas.  </li>
            <li>It has a very strong peppermint smell, your whole house will smell like it</li>
            <li>I received this product with the top taped on - which was my first clue</li>
            <li>I used it as a room spray/ spider deterrent and so far I haven&#x27;t seen any spiders and it made my house smell pretty nice!</li>
            <li>and it smelled better than my bottle, but not as good as the other brands.  </li>
            <li>A strong and pure peppermint that will knock your socks off!  </li>
            <li>the bottle could not have been full when it arrived.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this oil along with sweet orange oil and lavendar oil to mix in a himalyan salt bath.  </li>
            <li>I think the quality to price ratio is great with Aura Cacia peppermint, but not for any of their other E.O.s</li>
            <li>Most other essentail oils aren&#x27;t very strong in my opinion and you have to use tons of product to get any scent.  </li>
            <li>Good price, not much to ship</li>
            <li>For being my first essential oil, I love it!</li>
            <li>I used this when I had strep throat and a fever of 104 and was not due to take any more tylenol.</li>
            <li>However they just got lucky sending me the rosemary that also works for what I wanted it for, otherwise they would have one star for timely delivery (which still isn&#x27;t as fast as some others I have had things shipped from).</li>
            <li>I had a co worker that had peppermint oil that was potent enough that when you inhale it, it would give you an energy boost.</li>
            <li>Works for days, not expensive and harmless to us, our pets and the environment.</li>
            <li>Really?!  </li>
            <li>Purchased for the first time after being referred by a friend who also uses this product and brand.</li>
            <li>100% satisfied and will order again once I&#x27;m low.</li>
            <li>It was also not quite as full as normal.  </li>
            <li>Will be purchasing more in the future!</li>
            <li>I think all of the Aura Cacia oils are of good quality and value, if you want small amounts.  </li>
            <li>it smelled beautiful and enticing the few times i used it, and i guess i could have made a scented a candle with it or something, but i use essential oils medicinally, am not looking for a candy cane peppermint.</li>
            <li>but I think it is less diluted and therefore more economical than those products.  </li>
            <li>The 100% Peppermint essential is great to add (a few drops) to the bath, to add fragrance in a burner that has a tealight underneath it, and/or to &amp;#34;perk up&amp;#34; potpourri.  </li>
            <li>but it was too much.</li>
            <li>Amazon contacted me and although not returnable - they have opted to refund me for this and allow a reorder at same price with free one-day shipping.</li>
            <li>or if I really don&#x27;t know what peppermint smells like.  </li>
            <li>The smell of this oil is very soothing and refeshing.</li>
            <li>It stops the itching fast.</li>
            <li>that is not what i wanted, rather a potent, undiluted, unsweet-smelling peppermint, like the peppermint essential oils i have purchased in the past, except they were not from Aura Casia and will never again be from Aura Casia, nothing more from Aura Cacia, period.  </li>
            <li>This Aura Cacia Essential Oil did not come in the original manufacturer&#x27;s packaging.  </li>
            <li>The lemongrass mixed with distilled water and vanilla extract is also a good air freshener/cleaner, as is the orange (less concentrated).  </li>
            <li>It just takes a few drops for most any application - very concentrated - like the lemongrass version.  </li>
            <li>but they sell the same brand at the grocery store here (for more $) and it smells the same.</li>
            <li>I would give a positive recommendation to the Aura Cacia brand as I have used it frequently.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend you try some.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this oil for relaxation or salt baths or scrubs.</li>
            <li>After much debate on chemical barriers for insects and dogs, we decided to go natural and stop poisoning our dogs blood.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and i live alone, so</li>
            <li>I use as an alternative to medication to help relieve headaches that I get very frequently.</li>
            <li>I take a hot bath with essential oils and salt every night to detoxify and relax away my day.  </li>
            <li>i store my bottles upright, they are in an overpacked soft container where fitting another small bottle in is a challenge, so from the time it arrived, it never had the chance to turn over.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i am accustomed to peppermint having a strong, almost harsh smell.  </li>
            <li>Overall I really like it</li>
            <li>I am guessing it is old and rotten.  </li>
            <li>I actually went to Whole Foods to smell their tester for this</li>
            <li>my local food co-op sells which is a bit more expensive but has consistently higher quality.</li>
            <li>A little pricey, but well worth it.</li>
            <li>At first the feeling of coolness was a little too intense and I diluted it with a little jojoba oil, but now that I&#x27;ve gotten used to it</li>

            <li> I have purchased this brand from local stores numerous times and it comes in a small box - which is also very helpful to store the bottle in as it gets oily sometimes.</li>
            <li> this being my first one I&#x27;m not sure yet if other essential oils smell stronger.</li>
            <li> It is disturbing to me that something you use on or in your body would not come in the original packaging, I have to wonder if the bottle was refilled with a lesser product.  </li>
            <li> I mix this with some distille water and a little olive oil, place it in an old spray bottle and use it to treat any itchy areas on my dogs skin.  </li>
            <li> i barely used it, only a few drops several times and the bottle is already empty.  </li>
            <li> I listened to a podcast that mentioned that peppermint reduces a fever when rubbed on the bottom of your feet (and forehead- as long as you avoid the eyes).</li>
            <li> It works sort of like \\&quot;Head On\\&quot; or other topical headache medications</li>
            <li> For other essential oils I prefer the brand</li>
            <li> essential oils take me a long time to use up, and this bottle was advertised as a half ounce, about 15 ml.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the cheapest peppermint essential oil around, but I bought it with a larger order which I was having shipped, and this cost no more to ship.  </li>
            <li> thought the 0.5 oz would be a little bigger</li>
            <li> It has an almost cocoa smell to it, not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not warming as other peppermint oils that Ive used.</li>
            <li> normally, this would upset me, but in this case, i was so disappointed with the candy-like smell of the oil from the first whiff to the thankfully last whiff just now, that i could hardly stand to use</li>
            <li> There is a faint odor of peppermint and a large odor of rottenness.&lt;br /&gt;Again-</li>
            <li> Not really worth it on a $7 bottle of oil.</li>
            <li> so it seemed odd to me.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is the brand or even the typical smell of this oil.  </li>
            <li> It did smell a little weaker than I thought it would but</li>
            <li> I use it for my hair and when I&#x27;m feeling a little stressed</li>
            <li> Larger sizes are less expensive in other brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll put a few drops into my bath</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aura Cacia peppermint oil for headache relief for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> As usual this purchase has lived up to it&#x27;s expectations.</li>
            <li> I use eucalyptus and mint oils in sauna inhalation / aroma therapy for the past 30 years.</li>
            <li> It is not able to be returned -</li>
            <li> I was going crazy with constantly finding ants in my house though</li>
            <li> When I went to open it - the smell made me sick to my stomach.  </li>
            <li> something was wrong.</li>
            <li> I thought I bought the wrong stuff</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> By far the best peppermint oil out there. I&#x27;ve tried many others and it is the most pure. A little pricey, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, as it is a very intense scent - way more concentrated than peppermint extract you might cook with. The price from Nutricity was about as good as anywhere, the shipping was free with $25.00, but the shipping time was the worst I have had in years due to some service called Streamlite (12 days).</li>
            <li> I ordered peppermint oil because I was told that spraying a diluted amount around your house would make ants avoid it. (I have like four different kinds living around my house I need to take care of) When I received the oil it turned out to be rosemary oil. I was told that it also could work but I ordered the peppermint because I prefer the scent. I was going crazy with constantly finding ants in my house though so I just tried it. It seems to be working fine, and it did arrive on time. However they just got lucky sending me the rosemary that also works for what I wanted it for, otherwise they would have one star for timely delivery (which still isn&#x27;t as fast as some others I have had things shipped from).</li>
            <li> A strong and pure peppermint that will knock your socks off!  Try it with Rosemary, Tangerine or Lime E.O.s</li>
            <li> Product arrived to me spilled all over and 1/4 gone. Not too thrilled.</li>
            <li> Contacted Livamed, but they said that in order for me to return the oil, I have to pay return shipping and and a 15% restocking fee. Not really worth it on a $7 bottle of oil.</li>
            <li> I had a co worker that had peppermint oil that was potent enough that when you inhale it, it would give you an energy boost. This is not that type of oil. The product probably does what it is intended for, but I wish it could do it all.</li>
            <li> For being my first essential oil, I love it! I used it as a room spray/ spider deterrent and so far I haven&#x27;t seen any spiders and it made my house smell pretty nice! It did smell a little weaker than I thought it would but this being my first one I&#x27;m not sure yet if other essential oils smell stronger. Overall I really like it and I&#x27;d recommend it!</li>
            <li> My mother uses peppermint oil all the time so wanted some more for Christmas.  Good price, not much to ship and she was very happy with it! Easier than going to the health stores!</li>
            <li> After much debate on chemical barriers for insects and dogs, we decided to go natural and stop poisoning our dogs blood.&lt;br /&gt;The mixture of natural oils does a good job on repelling mosquitoes, ticks and fleas.  Works for days, not expensive and harmless to us, our pets and the environment.Highly recommend you try some.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the cheapest peppermint essential oil around, but I bought it with a larger order which I was having shipped, and this cost no more to ship.  It&#x27;s perfectly nice.  I mix it with distilled water and vanilla extract for a nice air freshener and with a diluted unscented dish detergent (eco-friendly) in addition to the vanilla and peppermint and it&#x27;s a great all-purpose kitchen spray for wiping up and making your kitchen smell great.  It just takes a few drops for most any application - very concentrated - like the lemongrass version.  Most other essentail oils aren&#x27;t very strong in my opinion and you have to use tons of product to get any scent.  The lemongrass mixed with distilled water and vanilla extract is also a good air freshener/cleaner, as is the orange (less concentrated).  I think all of the Aura Cacia oils are of good quality and value, if you want small amounts.  Larger sizes are less expensive in other brands.</li>
            <li> The 100% Peppermint essential is great to add (a few drops) to the bath, to add fragrance in a burner that has a tealight underneath it, and/or to &amp;#34;perk up&amp;#34; potpourri.  For aromatherapy purposes, it is listed as &amp;#34;energizing and cooling.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Incredible smell and the aroma lasts for a good amount of time. Excellent for headaches or otherwise just freshening the room up.</li>
            <li> I used this in a home remedy recipe along with lemon juice and lavender to make mosquito repellant that smells nice and is non-toxic.  It works great. Two more ingredients are vanilla extract and water.</li>
            <li> essential oils take me a long time to use up, and this bottle was advertised as a half ounce, about 15 ml.  i barely used it, only a few drops several times and the bottle is already empty.  i store my bottles upright, they are in an overpacked soft container where fitting another small bottle in is a challenge, so from the time it arrived, it never had the chance to turn over.  and i live alone, so no one gets into my stuff and uses it.  the bottle could not have been full when it arrived.  normally, this would upset me, but in this case, i was so disappointed with the candy-like smell of the oil from the first whiff to the thankfully last whiff just now, that i could hardly stand to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am accustomed to peppermint having a strong, almost harsh smell.  this smelled like a Yankee Candle Company peppermint, like a peppermint candy cane.  Really?!  that is not what i wanted, rather a potent, undiluted, unsweet-smelling peppermint, like the peppermint essential oils i have purchased in the past, except they were not from Aura Casia and will never again be from Aura Casia, nothing more from Aura Cacia, period.  it smelled beautiful and enticing the few times i used it, and i guess i could have made a scented a candle with it or something, but i use essential oils medicinally, am not looking for a candy cane peppermint.</li>
            <li> Loved the product. Awesome quality. Happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Purchased for the first time after being referred by a friend who also uses this product and brand. I absolutely love! I use as an alternative to medication to help relieve headaches that I get very frequently. 100% satisfied and will order again once I&#x27;m low.</li>
            <li> Aura Cacia is one of my fav brands. As usual this purchase has lived up to it&#x27;s expectations. I listened to a podcast that mentioned that peppermint reduces a fever when rubbed on the bottom of your feet (and forehead- as long as you avoid the eyes). I used this when I had strep throat and a fever of 104 and was not due to take any more tylenol. It worked! And the best thing is, it&#x27;s all natural and you can&#x27;t OD on it so you can use it as many times as you need.</li>
            <li> Used in an oil diffuser for allergies and congestion. Also used for headaches by applying to the temples. Worked great for both. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product and works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not warming as other peppermint oils that Ive used.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality.  No issues</li>
            <li> The smell was very very strong. I didn&#x27;t feel like it captured what I wanted. I was thinking it would be a candy cane type scent but it was too much. It gave me an instant headache.</li>
            <li> I just love the smell of peppermint.  I find it incredibly relaxing as well as soothing to the skin.  I purchased this oil along with sweet orange oil and lavendar oil to mix in a himalyan salt bath.  I take a hot bath with essential oils and salt every night to detoxify and relax away my day.  The peppermint oil is so cooling and soothing to sore joints and its the peppermint oil that in a bath will create a cooling sensation in my joints and sore areas.  Aura oils are one of the best oils to use in general.  I highly recommend this oil for relaxation or salt baths or scrubs.</li>
            <li> A good way to wake up the senses !</li>
            <li> This Aura Cacia Essential Oil did not come in the original manufacturer&#x27;s packaging.  I have purchased this brand from local stores numerous times and it comes in a small box - which is also very helpful to store the bottle in as it gets oily sometimes. It was also not quite as full as normal.  It is disturbing to me that something you use on or in your body would not come in the original packaging, I have to wonder if the bottle was refilled with a lesser product.  I would like to return the product but haven&#x27;t figured out how to not pay for the shipping which I don&#x27;t feel I should have to since I consider it defective.  I would give a positive recommendation to the Aura Cacia brand as I have used it frequently.</li>
            <li> I use eucalyptus and mint oils in sauna inhalation / aroma therapy for the past 30 years. This is a best brand for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy other chipper ones.</li>
            <li> I love this product it is very good, need a soothing massage to the scalp i mixed this with my shampoo and it worked wonders</li>
            <li> This smells very good. It has a very strong peppermint smell, your whole house will smell like it lol.&lt;br /&gt;I thought the 0.5 oz would be a little bigger but that&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;Next time I will just order a bigger bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have ordered many essential oils on line and AuraCacia is a great brand - I think the problem is with who shipped it.  I received this product with the top taped on - which was my first clue something was wrong. I have never had a leak problem with a bottle of essential oil so it seemed odd to me.  When I went to open it - the smell made me sick to my stomach.  There is a faint odor of peppermint and a large odor of rottenness.&lt;br /&gt;Again- I don&#x27;t think it is the brand or even the typical smell of this oil.  I am guessing it is old and rotten.  It is not able to be returned - so I am just putting this out as a warning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update- Amazon contacted me and although not returnable - they have opted to refund me for this and allow a reorder at same price with free one-day shipping.</li>
            <li> Peppermint smells wierd!  Not just like the gum, or even a mint plant.  It has an almost cocoa smell to it, not what I expected.  Don&#x27;t know if it is just this brand or if I really don&#x27;t know what peppermint smells like.  I thought I bought the wrong stuff but they sell the same brand at the grocery store here (for more $) and it smells the same.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m with those who found the smell to be &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;.  I actually went to Whole Foods to smell their tester for this and it smelled better than my bottle, but not as good as the other brands.  Either this batch was spoiled in shipping or Aura Cacia just doesn&#x27;t do pepermint well.  It smells like something the cat dragged in.</li>
            <li> The shipper did get it to me faster than said  but the Peppermint Oil did not have  a very strong smell of Peppermint</li>
            <li> Not their best. But it depends on what you&#x27;re into. They have better scents available in my opinion. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I use it for my hair and when I&#x27;m feeling a little stressed I&#x27;ll put a few drops into my bath it&#x27;s amazing!! Came very quick and was wrapped well. Will be purchasing more in the future!</li>
            <li> this is a great essential oil if you want to feel refreshed and rejuvenated. Add a drop or two into the bath or to a footbath and you&#x27;ll feel terrific.</li>
            <li> The smell of this oil is very soothing and refeshing. I lik to call this an multi-purpose oil.  I mix this with some distille water and a little olive oil, place it in an old spray bottle and use it to treat any itchy areas on my dogs skin.  He loves it! It stops the itching fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aura Cacia peppermint oil for headache relief for a few years now.  It works sort of like \\&quot;Head On\\&quot; or other topical headache medications but I think it is less diluted and therefore more economical than those products.  At first the feeling of coolness was a little too intense and I diluted it with a little jojoba oil, but now that I&#x27;ve gotten used to it I can just rub a couple of drops onto my forehead for almost instant relief.  I think the quality to price ratio is great with Aura Cacia peppermint, but not for any of their other E.O.s and I&#x27;ve tried several.  For other essential oils I prefer the brand my local food co-op sells which is a bit more expensive but has consistently higher quality.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and I love it! This brand is my favorite..good quality dependable brand. Great Product will order more  for sure...</li>
