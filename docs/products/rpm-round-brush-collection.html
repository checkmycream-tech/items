            <li>The openness of it allows for quick drying, and it is great for styling as well.</li>
            <li>and this is by far the best one.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>I bought the ones [...]; the price was right and the service was great.</li>
            <li>I married a jerk that time, but he had a great hairbrush.  </li>
            <li>The handle is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very good brush, very well constructed, with a comfortable rubberized grip.</li>
            <li>but I thought they didn&#x27;t exist any more because none of the stores had them.</li>
            <li>LOVE it for my longish hair.</li>
            <li>Both my wife and I have used these brushes for many years...</li>
            <li>I love this brush i have looked everywhere for it.</li>
            <li>It really is static free!</li>
            <li>Static is still there</li>
            <li>I love this brush.  </li>
            <li>Love this brush.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>and I am so glad I found them again.  </li>
            <li>I never have a problem with static</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brush for a couple months now and still love it.  </li>
            <li>I pull the lint up to the balls at the top of each bristle &amp; can&#x27;t get t hem out beyond that.  </li>
            <li>Love this item.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>Replaced one I had for many years.  </li>
            <li>Will buy more Cricket products.</li>
            <li>Every time I brush my hair there is a ton of static created with this brush.  </li>
            <li>Never thought I&#x27;d be writing a review of a brush, but again, this model is so much better than all the rest that I&#x27;m taking the time to write this review.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite brushes.  </li>
            <li>So glad i found it it was easy to purchase and came within a couple of day. :)</li>
            <li>These are very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>and yes, static free.</li>
            <li>The brush itself started out great, just like my old one.  </li>
            <li>however I bought this because it said static free -</li>
            <li>it is beyond static free.  </li>
            <li>The second one held up better, but that doubles the cost to get one usable brush and it still wasn&#x27;t great durability.  </li>
            <li>Durable, strong, and can withstand anything you put it though.  </li>
            <li>and I recommend it strongly.  </li>
            <li>The supermarket cheapo works fine</li>
            <li>i love my brush :) it looks exactly like the one in the picture.</li>
            <li>The rubber handle is comfortable and the bristles are easy on the scalp.  </li>
            <li>Love these brushes--they&#x27;re great for fine, limp hair and keep it static free.</li>
            <li>Ever since I saw the video of the turtle loving the toothbrush, I figured I would up the ante and get my turtle a real brush.  </li>
            <li>I was so happy to finally find it again.</li>
            <li>I used it to brush my hair with the conditioning in the shower, and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I was happy with this brush until the red bristle tips began falling off.</li>
            <li>I am a light user.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and the plastic is sturdy.</li>
            <li>Since pictures are worth so much more than words</li>
            <li>They really do keep the static to a minimum, and help settle whatever static may arise when using a hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Makes a quick and easy job of blow drying, without flyaway hair.</li>
            <li>This is probably the best hairbrush I ever had, I have long hair, and it works very well for me.</li>
            <li>You will love it soo much!</li>
            <li>I use to have 2 for personal use and when I found these in a hair salon on a trip I purchased 2 more for a friend who I knew the brush was also a favorite of hers (hairdresser) and her mother&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li>The Static Free Fast Flow makes blow drying super easy.</li>
            <li>B0002Z8OKG Cricket Mini Fast Flo Static Free]]</li>
            <li>how do you clean the \\&quot;lint\\&quot; out of it?</li>
            <li>I still had static electricity, but it is better than my old Brush.</li>
            <li>I had one for years and just lost one bristle, so was delighted to find the identical brush, but the quality is not the same.   </li>
            <li>I love it so much I had to buy another</li>
            <li>I loved it initially, but gave it a 3 because 18 months later I am again searching for a vent brush with good reviews.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely static free and replaces my old one.</li>
            <li>its winter and usually my hair has static and the brush is good for normal use and doesnt minimize static let alone eliminate it.</li>
            <li>This new brush is just ok.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other types of brushes, but this one is hands down the best</li>
            <li>Handle is really grippy and comfortable.</li>
            <li>so was happy to find this online and purchased a few extras.</li>
            <li>Brush lost many soft tips and fell apart within 6 months.</li>
            <li>This is my second Cricket Static Free Flo brush.  </li>
            <li>Product was as expected, good quality.</li>
            <li>I have used this brand of brush for many years and have no trouble with the product.</li>
            <li>I would buy this again (though a smaller size would be nice).</li>
            <li>Well worth it.  </li>
            <li>The end tips began falling off pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>The brush head is the right shape with just the right number of bristles and the right amount of flexibility.</li>
            <li>the bristles came right out and weren&#x27;t even glued in the holes.</li>
            <li>Well, thank goodness for Amazon and its partner sellers because my search on \\&quot;vented hair brush\\&quot; turned up my long lost Cricket brushes and I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
            <li>The do have very little static, are comfortable on your scalp, and pretty easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair anymore, but I recall I liked this brush when I did.</li>
            <li>The first brush lost almost all its end tips within a couple of months.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li>This works great for any hair, long or short.</li>
            <li>This one has never failed me.</li>
            <li>Bernese Mountain Dog ate the last Cricket and  now I&#x27;m glad she did.  </li>
            <li>My first one was given to me by my hairdresser, and I&#x27;ve purchased a replacement each time they wear out.</li>
            <li>I use it to brush my hair obviously and it doesn&#x27;t damage it or anything love it</li>
            <li>After 15 years my wife asked for an EXACT replacement and this was it.</li>
            <li>Its not expensive.</li>
            <li>It turned out to be exactly the same as the one I have had for many years</li>
            <li>Exactly what the photo looked like and</li>
            <li>I have had one of these for many years until it just finally wore out.</li>
            <li>great comb for long, slicked back hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for this brush for quite some time now and wouldn&#x27;t you know it was right here on Amazon the whole time.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I decided to order some new ones since I could not find it anywhere locally.</li>
            <li>If anyone wants a free bottle of CLEAR COAT, send me your address.</li>
            <li>I have been using this exact same style brush since high school (which has been many years ago)....</li>
            <li>My mom bought me my first Fast Flo 25 years ago</li>
            <li>Mine did not come in the color I ordered, but the all black is nice too.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and holds up extremely well!</li>
            <li>When I recently needed a new one, I did not know if I would be able to find it again.  </li>
            <li>One day at a beauty supply store a few years ago I found it again and was so happy to finally stock up on extras.</li>
            <li>Low price and cheap product.</li>
            <li>, which is the same brush only smaller, great for purses and vehicle consoles/glove compartments.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thumper thanks you and so do I.  </li>
            <li>Both are labeled fast flo/Cricket.</li>
            <li>very unreliable.</li>
            <li>He seems to really like it.  </li>
            <li>and I was really at a loss.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t do much for body, but they get the job done.  </li>
            <li>Many brushes say they are Static-Free, but so far this is the only one that has lived up to the promise.  </li>
            <li>This is the second one I&#x27;ve had, replacing my first one that lasted for 14 years!!</li>
            <li>Any other brush gives me static.</li>
            <li>This version is slightly larger and has a unique way of keeping my hair pumped up</li>
            <li>Excellent for thin hair and not much of it.</li>
            <li>I have wavy thick hair and this brush is magic !</li>
            <li>it is far better than other mini vented brushes.</li>
            <li>This in the only type of brush I have ever liked, which isn&#x27;t to say I haven&#x27;t tried other brushes, I have, and have lived to regret it.  </li>
            <li>the bristles were too firm and hurt my head; or there weren&#x27;t enough bristles and the brushes didn&#x27;t do a good job of styling my hair; or they were too cheap and the rounded bristle tips came off with only a few weeks&#x27; worth of use - ouch!</li>
            <li>At that point I just get a new one.</li>
            <li>It is wide enough to get through most of the knots.</li>
            <li>His first one lasted for years but his one has only lasted about a year.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve kept it in my headset drawer at work, and while all other brushes have had massive static problems from being in that drawer, this Cricket does the trick.&lt;br</li>
            <li>she had used them in the past and wanted more once those broke</li>
            <li>My old brush (different brand and missing most of the plastic nubs on the tips of the brissels) creates a LOT less static than this brush.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>:  it really works on my long wavy hair without creating undue static, but the end tips on the bristles are not secure.</li>
            <li>The rubber grip is comfy and the head has a low profile and manoeuvres very well compared to a supermarket tunnel vent brush I used previously that was huge and cumbersome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a replacement for my old brush that has completely worn out over the years</li>
            <li>I am thankful that Amazon offers this product.  </li>
            <li>but the real problem I have is the bristle length is not the same.</li>
            <li>old bristles are 1&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Once the soft head tips fall off, the brush scratches the skin, irritates the scalp and causes scars.</li>
            <li>Just a simple brush really.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brush for more years than I care to remember - at least 15.</li>
            <li>They last for a super long time.  </li>
            <li>It easily glides through wet hair as you dry and feels sturdy.</li>
            <li>My husband and I used this same brush for years but needed a new one after years and years of use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a fantastic brush, at least in that 1 year of service.</li>
            <li>It simply does not function like the old one.</li>
            <li>The ball end disintegrated in barely a year of use.</li>
            <li>I have long, thick, naturally curly hair and have difficulty finding brushes that go through my hair easily.</li>
            <li>As a note, even with a small mist of water or even anti-static hair spray other brushes would still cause static and flyaways.</li>
            <li>Really helps with the stateliness that the other brushes had.</li>
            <li>I have long, thick hair, and no other brush gets through it as easily as this one.</li>
            <li>A third of the little \\&quot;beads\\&quot; are missing from the ends and many of the plastic bristles are bent at 90 degree angles.</li>
            <li>The more disappointing thing is I can&#x27;t get a new one until Cricket redesign their brush to have a one piece ball tip</li>
            <li>Because it is so open in it&#x27;s design, the brush makes quick work of drying my ultra thick hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine thin hair.</li>

            <li> I love this brush i have looked everywhere for it.</li>
            <li> It really is static free!</li>
            <li> Static is still there</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  </li>
            <li> Love this brush.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> and I am so glad I found them again.  </li>
            <li> I never have a problem with static</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for a couple months now and still love it.  </li>
            <li> I pull the lint up to the balls at the top of each bristle &amp; can&#x27;t get t hem out beyond that.  </li>
            <li> Love this item.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Replaced one I had for many years.  </li>
            <li> Will buy more Cricket products.</li>
            <li> Every time I brush my hair there is a ton of static created with this brush.  </li>
            <li> Never thought I&#x27;d be writing a review of a brush, but again, this model is so much better than all the rest that I&#x27;m taking the time to write this review.  </li>
            <li> One of my favorite brushes.  </li>
            <li> So glad i found it it was easy to purchase and came within a couple of day. :)</li>
            <li> These are very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> and yes, static free.</li>
            <li> The brush itself started out great, just like my old one.  </li>
            <li> however I bought this because it said static free -</li>
            <li> it is beyond static free.  </li>
            <li> The second one held up better, but that doubles the cost to get one usable brush and it still wasn&#x27;t great durability.  </li>
            <li> Durable, strong, and can withstand anything you put it though.  </li>
            <li> and I recommend it strongly.  </li>
            <li> The supermarket cheapo works fine</li>
            <li> i love my brush :) it looks exactly like the one in the picture.</li>
            <li> The rubber handle is comfortable and the bristles are easy on the scalp.  </li>
            <li> Love these brushes--they&#x27;re great for fine, limp hair and keep it static free.</li>
            <li> Ever since I saw the video of the turtle loving the toothbrush, I figured I would up the ante and get my turtle a real brush.  </li>
            <li> I was so happy to finally find it again.</li>
            <li> I used it to brush my hair with the conditioning in the shower, and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I was happy with this brush until the red bristle tips began falling off.</li>
            <li> I am a light user.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and the plastic is sturdy.</li>
            <li> Since pictures are worth so much more than words</li>
            <li> They really do keep the static to a minimum, and help settle whatever static may arise when using a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Makes a quick and easy job of blow drying, without flyaway hair.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best hairbrush I ever had, I have long hair, and it works very well for me.</li>
            <li> You will love it soo much!</li>
            <li> I use to have 2 for personal use and when I found these in a hair salon on a trip I purchased 2 more for a friend who I knew the brush was also a favorite of hers (hairdresser) and her mother&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li> The Static Free Fast Flow makes blow drying super easy.</li>
            <li> B0002Z8OKG Cricket Mini Fast Flo Static Free]]</li>
            <li> how do you clean the \\&quot;lint\\&quot; out of it?</li>
            <li> I still had static electricity, but it is better than my old Brush.</li>
            <li> I had one for years and just lost one bristle, so was delighted to find the identical brush, but the quality is not the same.   </li>
            <li> I love it so much I had to buy another</li>
            <li> I loved it initially, but gave it a 3 because 18 months later I am again searching for a vent brush with good reviews.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely static free and replaces my old one.</li>
            <li> its winter and usually my hair has static and the brush is good for normal use and doesnt minimize static let alone eliminate it.</li>
            <li> This new brush is just ok.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other types of brushes, but this one is hands down the best</li>
            <li> Handle is really grippy and comfortable.</li>
            <li> so was happy to find this online and purchased a few extras.</li>
            <li> Brush lost many soft tips and fell apart within 6 months.</li>
            <li> This is my second Cricket Static Free Flo brush.  </li>
            <li> Product was as expected, good quality.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand of brush for many years and have no trouble with the product.</li>
            <li> I would buy this again (though a smaller size would be nice).</li>
            <li> Well worth it.  </li>
            <li> The end tips began falling off pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> The brush head is the right shape with just the right number of bristles and the right amount of flexibility.</li>
            <li> the bristles came right out and weren&#x27;t even glued in the holes.</li>
            <li> Well, thank goodness for Amazon and its partner sellers because my search on \\&quot;vented hair brush\\&quot; turned up my long lost Cricket brushes and I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
            <li> The do have very little static, are comfortable on your scalp, and pretty easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair anymore, but I recall I liked this brush when I did.</li>
            <li> The first brush lost almost all its end tips within a couple of months.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li> This works great for any hair, long or short.</li>
            <li> This one has never failed me.</li>
            <li> Bernese Mountain Dog ate the last Cricket and  now I&#x27;m glad she did.  </li>
            <li> My first one was given to me by my hairdresser, and I&#x27;ve purchased a replacement each time they wear out.</li>
            <li> I use it to brush my hair obviously and it doesn&#x27;t damage it or anything love it</li>
            <li> After 15 years my wife asked for an EXACT replacement and this was it.</li>
            <li> Its not expensive.</li>
            <li> It turned out to be exactly the same as the one I have had for many years</li>
            <li> Exactly what the photo looked like and</li>
            <li> I have had one of these for many years until it just finally wore out.</li>
            <li> great comb for long, slicked back hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this brush for quite some time now and wouldn&#x27;t you know it was right here on Amazon the whole time.  </li>
            <li> I liked it so much that I decided to order some new ones since I could not find it anywhere locally.</li>
            <li> If anyone wants a free bottle of CLEAR COAT, send me your address.</li>
            <li> I have been using this exact same style brush since high school (which has been many years ago)....</li>
            <li> My mom bought me my first Fast Flo 25 years ago</li>
            <li> Mine did not come in the color I ordered, but the all black is nice too.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and holds up extremely well!</li>
            <li> When I recently needed a new one, I did not know if I would be able to find it again.  </li>
            <li> One day at a beauty supply store a few years ago I found it again and was so happy to finally stock up on extras.</li>
            <li> Low price and cheap product.</li>
            <li> , which is the same brush only smaller, great for purses and vehicle consoles/glove compartments.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thumper thanks you and so do I.  </li>
            <li> Both are labeled fast flo/Cricket.</li>
            <li> very unreliable.</li>
            <li> He seems to really like it.  </li>
            <li> and I was really at a loss.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t do much for body, but they get the job done.  </li>
            <li> Many brushes say they are Static-Free, but so far this is the only one that has lived up to the promise.  </li>
            <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve had, replacing my first one that lasted for 14 years!!</li>
            <li> Any other brush gives me static.</li>
            <li> This version is slightly larger and has a unique way of keeping my hair pumped up</li>
            <li> Excellent for thin hair and not much of it.</li>
            <li> I have wavy thick hair and this brush is magic !</li>
            <li> it is far better than other mini vented brushes.</li>
            <li> This in the only type of brush I have ever liked, which isn&#x27;t to say I haven&#x27;t tried other brushes, I have, and have lived to regret it.  </li>
            <li> the bristles were too firm and hurt my head; or there weren&#x27;t enough bristles and the brushes didn&#x27;t do a good job of styling my hair; or they were too cheap and the rounded bristle tips came off with only a few weeks&#x27; worth of use - ouch!</li>
            <li> At that point I just get a new one.</li>
            <li> It is wide enough to get through most of the knots.</li>
            <li> His first one lasted for years but his one has only lasted about a year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve kept it in my headset drawer at work, and while all other brushes have had massive static problems from being in that drawer, this Cricket does the trick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> she had used them in the past and wanted more once those broke</li>
            <li> My old brush (different brand and missing most of the plastic nubs on the tips of the brissels) creates a LOT less static than this brush.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> :  it really works on my long wavy hair without creating undue static, but the end tips on the bristles are not secure.</li>
            <li> The rubber grip is comfy and the head has a low profile and manoeuvres very well compared to a supermarket tunnel vent brush I used previously that was huge and cumbersome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a replacement for my old brush that has completely worn out over the years</li>
            <li> I am thankful that Amazon offers this product.  </li>
            <li> but the real problem I have is the bristle length is not the same.</li>
            <li> old bristles are 1&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Once the soft head tips fall off, the brush scratches the skin, irritates the scalp and causes scars.</li>
            <li> Just a simple brush really.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for more years than I care to remember - at least 15.</li>
            <li> They last for a super long time.  </li>
            <li> It easily glides through wet hair as you dry and feels sturdy.</li>
            <li> My husband and I used this same brush for years but needed a new one after years and years of use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a fantastic brush, at least in that 1 year of service.</li>
            <li> It simply does not function like the old one.</li>
            <li> The ball end disintegrated in barely a year of use.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, naturally curly hair and have difficulty finding brushes that go through my hair easily.</li>
            <li> As a note, even with a small mist of water or even anti-static hair spray other brushes would still cause static and flyaways.</li>
            <li> Really helps with the stateliness that the other brushes had.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair, and no other brush gets through it as easily as this one.</li>
            <li> A third of the little \\&quot;beads\\&quot; are missing from the ends and many of the plastic bristles are bent at 90 degree angles.</li>
            <li> The more disappointing thing is I can&#x27;t get a new one until Cricket redesign their brush to have a one piece ball tip</li>
            <li> Because it is so open in it&#x27;s design, the brush makes quick work of drying my ultra thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine thin hair.</li>
            <li> Other than the color, it&#x27;s the same as my old red color ones I&#x27;ve been using for 10+ yrs.</li>
            <li> Feels like it is going to last a long time, too.</li>
            <li> I had someone ask me recently how I take care of my hair as long as it is</li>
            <li> They are shorter by nearly 1/4&amp;#34; and it does not go through my thick hair the same as my old one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only vent brush that she will use, since the others tend to hurt and tear out bits of her very long hair.</li>
            <li> But with the cricket I have virtually no static, so of course I couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I have used this brush for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> This replaces some dollar store find that I kept way too long.  </li>
            <li> It gets through long hair, with some waves without a problem.  </li>
            <li> I like the long, rubber gripped handle.  </li>
            <li> I actually use this brush with both wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li> I was sent the wrong product - a bottle of DRY FAST CLEAR COAT for nails - instead of the brush I ordered.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, so I don&#x27;t often brush my hair during the day, but after a small mist I can re-comb through my hair with this brush and not have everything start flying up.  </li>
            <li> I tried 4 different brushes to replace an old one that I had to throw away and all of them made my hair look ridiculous.</li>
            <li> It came in black not red but that did not bother me.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s larger than my previous brush, I like the non-static aspect--an issue during winter.  </li>
            <li> Old one is only missing 2 nubbies from all these years of use and not sure how this one will be in that department.</li>
            <li> I used to get them at a beauty supply store in town, but it closed</li>
            <li> It vents well when drying wet hair.  </li>
            <li> Mine usually last about 3 years before the round plastic tips start wearing off the ends of the bristles (and I wash/</li>
            <li> In all honesty its the only hairbrush that I can get through my daughters hair without her crying.  </li>
            <li> I used it daily for about 15 years and only one of the red plastic tips had broken off by then.</li>
            <li> This is due to the fact that the ball ends are not molded with the stem, like that supermarket cheapo</li>
            <li> One dropped out, exposing the sharp barb of the stem.</li>
            <li> The small hairbrush I keep in my desk drawer died after a couple years of daily use.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t have a hole on the handle to hang it with.</li>
            <li> It untangles my thick hair and my last one lasted for years.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU HAVE THICK, KNOTTY, OR COARSE HAIR.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, coarse and wavy, btw, but I feel this brush would please anyone.</li>
            <li> Keeping those course hairs down, is no longer an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I either lost one of mine or perhaps theiving children but down to just one.</li>
            <li> dry my hair at least once a day).</li>
            <li> After having the brush for 6 months or so, nearly half the tips are missing and the tips are now somewhat jagged.</li>
            <li> The little round nubs started falling off.  </li>
            <li> I asked him to say a few words:  </li>
            <li> This replaces the one I had for a few years.  </li>
            <li> I use this brush everyday when drying my hair and styling it.</li>
            <li> I found this brand of brush a few years ago while on vacation in CT.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for the past year and a half, with no problems.</li>
            <li> And now here it is at half the price I paid at the beauty store!</li>
            <li> The bristles are not too stiff or too flexible and they don&#x27;t pinch or pull my hair . . . .</li>
            <li> But at least 1/4 of the little plastic ends on the bristles fell off by the time I had the brush for a few months.</li>
            <li> Using a normal hair brush I find it almost impossible to fix my hair during the cold dry winter months, the static is just that bad.  </li>
            <li> Brushes I have owned in the past have lasted for 3 to 5 years before bristles break.</li>
            <li> No static either.</li>
            <li> I bought a few of them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for at least 20 years</li>
            <li> (well, I&#x27;ve had to periodically replace it as it eventually wears out, but you know what I mean).  </li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> Nothing else works as well on thin hair.</li>
            <li> This brush was poor in quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible not to scratch your scalp without them.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t notice until the brush begins to hurt the skin badly.</li>
            <li> to the bad news.</li>
            <li> My brush looks awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the brush my husband uses. His first one lasted for years but his one has only lasted about a year. The end tips began falling off pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> The Static Free Fast Flow makes blow drying super easy. It easily glides through wet hair as you dry and feels sturdy. I&#x27;ve had a lot hairbrush handles break, but this one feels solid.</li>
            <li> My daughter in law was very happy with the brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this brush for quite some time now and wouldn&#x27;t you know it was right here on Amazon the whole time.  It&#x27;s a replacement for my old brush that has completely worn out over the years but I never could find anything to compare with it in stores. Using a normal hair brush I find it almost impossible to fix my hair during the cold dry winter months, the static is just that bad.  But with the cricket I have virtually no static, so of course I couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I had one for years and just lost one bristle, so was delighted to find the identical brush, but the quality is not the same.   Comfortable grip and great performance:  it really works on my long wavy hair without creating undue static, but the end tips on the bristles are not secure. The first brush lost almost all its end tips within a couple of months.  Not good. It&#x27;s impossible not to scratch your scalp without them.  The second one held up better, but that doubles the cost to get one usable brush and it still wasn&#x27;t great durability.  Wish the quality hadn&#x27;t been so eroded.  Low price and cheap product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for the past year and a half, with no problems. It&#x27;s a very good brush, very well constructed, with a comfortable rubberized grip. Not the biggest fan of red, but hey, it&#x27;s a brush. I&#x27;ve kept it in my headset drawer at work, and while all other brushes have had massive static problems from being in that drawer, this Cricket does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter uses the [[ASIN:B0002Z8OKG Cricket Mini Fast Flo Static Free]], which is the same brush only smaller, great for purses and vehicle consoles/glove compartments. It&#x27;s the only vent brush that she will use, since the others tend to hurt and tear out bits of her very long hair.</li>
            <li> Great price and super effective. Any other brush gives me static. This is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for. Handle is really grippy and comfortable. Feels like it is going to last a long time, too.</li>
            <li> I had one of these years ago but I thought they didn&#x27;t exist any more because none of the stores had them. I&#x27;ve bought and thrown away countless inferior vented brushes since then: the bristles were too firm and hurt my head; or there weren&#x27;t enough bristles and the brushes didn&#x27;t do a good job of styling my hair; or they were too cheap and the rounded bristle tips came off with only a few weeks&#x27; worth of use - ouch! Well, thank goodness for Amazon and its partner sellers because my search on \\&quot;vented hair brush\\&quot; turned up my long lost Cricket brushes and I&#x27;m thrilled. The brush head is the right shape with just the right number of bristles and the right amount of flexibility. The handle is very comfortable. I bought the mini also - like its full-size counterpart it is far better than other mini vented brushes. I bought the ones [...]; the price was right and the service was great.</li>
            <li> I have been using this exact same style brush since high school (which has been many years ago).... LOVE it for my longish hair.</li>
            <li> Ever since I saw the video of the turtle loving the toothbrush, I figured I would up the ante and get my turtle a real brush.  Keeping those course hairs down, is no longer an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thumper thanks you and so do I.  I asked him to say a few words:  ads  etr  fhg  yui  (that&#x27;s turtle for Thank you)</li>
            <li> This is the best hairbrush I&#x27;ve every used.  I had one for years and when it finally wore out I looked for the same brush.  Nothing else works as well on thin hair.</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome..better than my $65.00 brush....I was so happy to finally find it again.</li>
            <li> I used it to brush my hair with the conditioning in the shower, and it is fantastic. You will love it soo much!</li>
            <li> This replaces the one I had for a few years.  Excellent for thin hair and not much of it.</li>
            <li> Replaced an existing item I&#x27;d had for years. Great product.</li>
            <li> This was great bought two of them for my mom she had used them in the past and wanted more once those broke she got them and was completely thrilled</li>
            <li> I use this brush everyday when drying my hair and styling it. The openness of it allows for quick drying, and it is great for styling as well.</li>
            <li> After only 4 months, 20-25% of the bristles have fallen out. I have fine thin hair. Going back to Conair.</li>
            <li> The balls at the end of the &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; are big and tangle my hair. I gave it away.</li>
            <li> good brush, this is the type I always buy. It came in black not red but that did not bother me.</li>
            <li> Love This Brush!!! Use it All The Time</li>
            <li> Both my wife and I have used these brushes for many years...best value we&#x27;ve found.  The do have very little static, are comfortable on your scalp, and pretty easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve probably owned 20 of these over the years...and they work perfectly for us.</li>
            <li> I love this brush i have looked everywhere for it. So glad i found it it was easy to purchase and came within a couple of day. :)</li>
            <li> I loved this item. It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted! It is definitely static free and replaces my old one. I was very happy to get it.</li>
            <li> I was very happy to discover these at Amazon.  This is a great brush that I have used for years.  These are very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I married a jerk that time, but he had a great hairbrush.  And that&#x27;s the only thing I got out of that union besides aggravation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;j.</li>
            <li> I tried 4 different brushes to replace an old one that I had to throw away and all of them made my hair look ridiculous. Based on the reviews and the shape of this one (to allow air to blow through while using a hair dryer) my daughter decided to buy me this one and it&#x27;s PERFECT.</li>
            <li> I was happy with this brush until the red bristle tips began falling off. After having the brush for 6 months or so, nearly half the tips are missing and the tips are now somewhat jagged. Time for a different brand...</li>
            <li> I bought this back in 2011, and I still use it to this day whenever the weather is not working well with my hair. It really is static free!</li>
            <li> I found this brand of brush a few years ago while on vacation in CT.  When I recently needed a new one, I did not know if I would be able to find it again.  I am thankful that Amazon offers this product.  It&#x27;s a great brush and yes, static free.</li>
            <li> I tried to obtain a duplicate vent brush that I bought perhaps 15-20 years ago. I use to have 2 for personal use and when I found these in a hair salon on a trip I purchased 2 more for a friend who I knew the brush was also a favorite of hers (hairdresser) and her mother&#x27;s favorite. This new brush is just ok. Static is still there but the real problem I have is the bristle length is not the same. They are shorter by nearly 1/4&amp;#34; and it does not go through my thick hair the same as my old one. Both are labeled fast flo/Cricket. Old one is only missing 2 nubbies from all these years of use and not sure how this one will be in that department. I either lost one of mine or perhaps theiving children but down to just one. Nowhere in the description is the bristle length stated or perhaps I would not have purchased this brush.  It simply does not function like the old one. old bristles are 1&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, so I don&#x27;t often brush my hair during the day, but after a small mist I can re-comb through my hair with this brush and not have everything start flying up.  As a note, even with a small mist of water or even anti-static hair spray other brushes would still cause static and flyaways.</li>
            <li> Brush lost many soft tips and fell apart within 6 months. I have short hair and I brush once or twice a day. Brushes I have owned in the past have lasted for 3 to 5 years before bristles break. This brush was poor in quality. Once the soft head tips fall off, the brush scratches the skin, irritates the scalp and causes scars. You won&#x27;t notice until the brush begins to hurt the skin badly. I am a light user. The brush may fall apart sooner for a heavier user. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great for using with a hairdryer. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t have a hole on the handle to hang it with.</li>
            <li> This is my second brush! My mom used mine and she loved it and told me to order one for her. This works great for any hair, long or short. Really helps with the stateliness that the other brushes had. Perfect size and perfect price!</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  It untangles my thick hair and my last one lasted for years.</li>
            <li> Great brush! I love it so much I had to buy another so I can always bring it with me.</li>
            <li> Let me start by giving the good news. This brush is probably the best brush I have handled. It&#x27;s light and the plastic is sturdy. The rubber grip is comfy and the head has a low profile and manoeuvres very well compared to a supermarket tunnel vent brush I used previously that was huge and cumbersome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to the bad news. The ball end disintegrated in barely a year of use. This is due to the fact that the ball ends are not molded with the stem, like that supermarket cheapo I got: what the manufacturers did was take the stem and dip it into red plastic that just could not stand up to the heat and friction from brushing. Almost all the ball ends, especially the leading edge are worn. One dropped out, exposing the sharp barb of the stem. The more disappointing thing is I can&#x27;t get a new one until Cricket redesign their brush to have a one piece ball tip stem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a fantastic brush, at least in that 1 year of service. The supermarket cheapo works fine but it rips out hair like nothing. So Cricket, please do something.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU HAVE THICK, KNOTTY, OR COARSE HAIR. the bristles came right out and weren&#x27;t even glued in the holes. very unreliable.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my son.  He seems to really like it.  Would buy it again if needed.</li>
            <li> Love this brush.  I have be using this brush for about 14 years and I love it.  It is the best brush and I am so glad I found them again.  I used to get them at a beauty supply store in town, but it closed and I was really at a loss.  Love It!!!</li>
            <li> What can I say it&#x27;s a brush and it works I guess it was a good price courtship and delivery thank you</li>
            <li> I have used these brushes for over 15 years.  They are wonderful. Just a simple brush really.  Mine did not come in the color I ordered, but the all black is nice too.  They last for a super long time.  They don&#x27;t do much for body, but they get the job done.  I never have a problem with static</li>
            <li> This is my second Cricket Static Free Flo brush.  It is a great flexible brush.  Helps eliminate tugging on your hair when brushing out tangles.</li>
            <li> I have been using this &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; for years - had two of them  - so was happy to find this online and purchased a few extras.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have curly hair and this brush is amazing. We can use it in the shower to comb out our curls and use it when we style our hair. It&#x27;s easy to clean and holds up extremely well! Great price too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these brushes for years. They really do keep the static to a minimum, and help settle whatever static may arise when using a hair dryer. The plastic bristles have ball tips that wear off or break off after several years. At that point I just get a new one. I&#x27;ve literally been using these brushes for over twenty years. That&#x27;s how much I love them!</li>
            <li> My mom bought me my first Fast Flo 25 years ago and I&#x27;ve been using the brush ever since. I have long, thick, naturally curly hair and have difficulty finding brushes that go through my hair easily. This one has never failed me. No static either. I had someone ask me recently how I take care of my hair as long as it is and I told her about this brush. Excellent brush!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for a couple months now and still love it.  It vents well when drying wet hair.  The handle is a good size and  I like the rubber grip.  The bristles are not too stiff or too flexible and they don&#x27;t pinch or pull my hair . . . . perfect!  Would recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush \\&quot;forever\\&quot;...how do you clean the \\&quot;lint\\&quot; out of it? I pull the lint up to the balls at the top of each bristle &amp; can&#x27;t get t hem out beyond that.  My brush looks awful.</li>
            <li> The red balls at end of bristles come off.  I don&#x27;t like it, but my friend that is a beautician suggested them.</li>
            <li> Product was as expected, good quality. I would recommend. My hair does not get stuck in it and it does not pull my hair out.</li>
            <li> Bernese Mountain Dog ate the last Cricket and  now I&#x27;m glad she did.  This version is slightly larger and has a unique way of keeping my hair pumped up so it has volume while  still smoothing out the kinks.</li>
            <li> I have wavy thick hair and this brush is magic ! This brush doesn&#x27;t hurt or pull somehow it gets all of the knots out without hurting your head. I have used this brush for as long as I can remember. I have about five different brushes all around my house and this is by far the best one.&lt;br /&gt;If your brush struggles with knots and hurts your head and hair trying to get them out I definitely recommend this one for you !</li>
            <li> I have used this brand of brush for many years and have no trouble with the product. I wish that I could say the same for the supplier. I was sent the wrong product - a bottle of DRY FAST CLEAR COAT for nails - instead of the brush I ordered. I have called THREE times and each time I was told that I would be issued a return label and what I ordered...NOTHING. If anyone wants a free bottle of CLEAR COAT, send me your address. Apparantly this company only cares about making the sale and not getting their customers what they pay for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for more years than I care to remember - at least 15. My first one was given to me by my hairdresser, and I&#x27;ve purchased a replacement each time they wear out. Mine usually last about 3 years before the round plastic tips start wearing off the ends of the bristles (and I wash/dry my hair at least once a day). Many brushes say they are Static-Free, but so far this is the only one that has lived up to the promise.  Because it is so open in it&#x27;s design, the brush makes quick work of drying my ultra thick hair. Love this item.</li>
            <li> Since pictures are worth so much more than words I wish I could post a picture of the cricket brush I bought on amazon 18 months ago. A third of the little \\&quot;beads\\&quot; are missing from the ends and many of the plastic bristles are bent at 90 degree angles. I&#x27;m having to throw it away because it pulls my daughters hair out when we try to use. I loved it initially, but gave it a 3 because 18 months later I am again searching for a vent brush with good reviews.  I may end up buying this one again knowing it has a 1 year lifespan.</li>
            <li> This in the only type of brush I have ever liked, which isn&#x27;t to say I haven&#x27;t tried other brushes, I have, and have lived to regret it.  This replaces some dollar store find that I kept way too long.  I&#x27;d forgotten how nice it is to brush my hair without drawing blood.  I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair anymore, but I recall I liked this brush when I did.</li>
            <li> i love my brush :) it looks exactly like the one in the picture. I use it to brush my hair obviously and it doesn&#x27;t damage it or anything love it</li>
            <li> The small hairbrush I keep in my desk drawer died after a couple years of daily use.  While it&#x27;s larger than my previous brush, I like the non-static aspect--an issue during winter.  The rubber handle is comfortable and the bristles are easy on the scalp.  I would buy this again (though a smaller size would be nice).</li>
            <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve had, replacing my first one that lasted for 14 years!! Love these brushes--they&#x27;re great for fine, limp hair and keep it static free. I have every brush in this line--keep a mini one in my purse, and one in the car, too!!</li>
            <li> The brush itself started out great, just like my old one.  But at least 1/4 of the little plastic ends on the bristles fell off by the time I had the brush for a few months.</li>
            <li> Makes a quick and easy job of blow drying, without flyaway hair. Great value. Good quality product. Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> After 15 years my wife asked for an EXACT replacement and this was it.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a smaller brush.</li>
            <li> These are the only hairbrushes my wife and daughter will use.  In all honesty its the only hairbrush that I can get through my daughters hair without her crying.  These are the best.</li>
            <li> Replaced one I had for many years.  The little round nubs started falling off.  Got this one at probably a 1/4 of what it cost me at SuperCuts 15 years ago!</li>
            <li> My husband and I used this same brush for years but needed a new one after years and years of use. I was so happy to find it on Amazon. This is our favorite brush!!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush back in 1994 or 1995 and I still have it. I used it daily for about 15 years and only one of the red plastic tips had broken off by then. The handle is shiny with wear. One day at a beauty supply store a few years ago I found it again and was so happy to finally stock up on extras. And now here it is at half the price I paid at the beauty store! I have long, thick hair, and no other brush gets through it as easily as this one. I&#x27;ll never use anything else.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush i&#x27;ve ever owned. It keeps the static out! Its not expensive. I bought a few of them!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, and materials used for product.  Durable, strong, and can withstand anything you put it though.  Will buy more Cricket products.</li>
            <li> It turned out to be exactly the same as the one I have had for many years and that was just what I was looking for.  Was delivered on time or before .  Exactly what the photo looked like and the description said.  Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> It brushes like a regular airflow brush however I bought this because it said static free - it is beyond static free.  Every time I brush my hair there is a ton of static created with this brush.  My old brush (different brand and missing most of the plastic nubs on the tips of the brissels) creates a LOT less static than this brush.&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side this brush has all of its plastic nubs still on all the brissels so my scalp is happy.</li>
            <li> I have had one of these for many years until it just finally wore out. I liked it so much that I decided to order some new ones since I could not find it anywhere locally.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for at least 20 years (well, I&#x27;ve had to periodically replace it as it eventually wears out, but you know what I mean).  I&#x27;ve tried many other types of brushes, but this one is hands down the best and I recommend it strongly.  Never thought I&#x27;d be writing a review of a brush, but again, this model is so much better than all the rest that I&#x27;m taking the time to write this review.  My hair is thick, coarse and wavy, btw, but I feel this brush would please anyone.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite brushes.  It gets through long hair, with some waves without a problem.  I like the long, rubber gripped handle.  Well worth it.  We had one already, but I wanted my own!</li>
            <li> great comb for long, slicked back hair</li>
            <li> Best brush ever…glad I found another on Amazon!!</li>
            <li> I still use this! It&#x27;s great. Not fancy, or girly. Just what you need to get the job done! A-</li>
            <li> I still had static electricity, but it is better than my old Brush.</li>
            <li> Other than the color, it&#x27;s the same as my old red color ones I&#x27;ve been using for 10+ yrs. Works as advertised.</li>
            <li> its winter and usually my hair has static and the brush is good for normal use and doesnt minimize static let alone eliminate it.</li>
            <li> I actually use this brush with both wet and dry hair. It is wide enough to get through most of the knots.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best hairbrush I ever had, I have long hair, and it works very well for me.</li>
