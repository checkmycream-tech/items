            <li>I was on a mission to have the best teeth possible.</li>
            <li>and my gums are healthy.</li>
            <li>I would like it if you could get more than one with the package.</li>
            <li>An attempt to re-invent, which we see happening all the time, as more time passes by.  </li>
            <li>and I know that this brush will serve a better purpose....</li>

            <li>Love this Toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I think the produce is ok....</li>
            <li>also didn&#x27;t feel like the surface of my teeth felt as clean as I liked--</li>
            <li>After years of praise for good oral health habits, for the first time ever there were pockets of bacteria around my wisdom teeth.</li>
            <li>My second time using one~ its amazing!!</li>
            <li>After taking my foot out of my mouth about the &amp;#34;hippie&amp;#34; thing, my Radius should clean it out just fine! :)</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re wonderful because they&#x27;re large so you can brush your teeth a fraction of the normal time.</li>
            <li>The soft version of this toothbrush is great.</li>
            <li>I met the owner of this company on an airplane many years ago and he sent me a free toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>A gentle dental toothbrush that feels good when brushing, without harming your gums.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would fit easily in my mouth, but it does.</li>
            <li>finally I bought one on Amazon (because I didn&#x27;t want to be &amp;#34;that&amp;#34; girl at the grocery) and FREAKING LOVED IT!</li>
            <li>I use this toothbrush every day and I love it, makes your mouth feel so clean</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a massage for your teeth and gums, so using it is enjoyable, and every time I go to the dentist he remarks on how clean my teeth are.  </li>
            <li>In fact, many times we buy the .99 special and call it perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li>I love using it because it get the coverage I am looking for quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is a huge toothbrush</li>
            <li>covers a lot of territory and is comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li>I bet it would make a great scrubber for smaller areas.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the cost of this unique toothbrush, and the gag factor made me not want to replace.</li>
            <li>, my mom jokingly asked if she was supposed to clean her shoes with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised more dentists aren&#x27;t recommending these!</li>
            <li>I love this brush with the large head.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m going to brush my teeth right now!</li>
            <li>My dentist scolded me on the danger I was doing, rather than some ultimate good.</li>
            <li>but as compared to my Sonicare, it feels like a mouth full.</li>
            <li>go measure the length of your teeth and quickly figure out that you&#x27;re not a horse.</li>
            <li>quick brush times&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s daunting when you first see how huge the bristle area is.</li>
            <li>Cleans much better than any brush I have used so far.  </li>
            <li>Love the soft bristles and the ability to massage my gums.</li>
            <li>Out went the toothbrush, and I am back to my nice, compact head that reaches everywhere</li>
            <li>Right Handed, Colors</li>
            <li>I am right handed, so I got the right handed toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The bristles of this toothbrush are indeed the right consistency.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my husband who is a big fan and has been for many years of the Radius Toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>I was first introduced to the radius in the 90s.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to actually use either.  </li>
            <li>My teeth always feel much cleaner after use!</li>
            <li>and at first he was pissed about changing.</li>
            <li>love this big toothbrush!  </li>
            <li>I love the big head of bristles!  </li>
            <li>I switched after my first try.</li>
            <li>an dont have to stop brushing to add more toothpaste, as i have to do with smaller brushes.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever be able to return to the skinny regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>On my first try I regretted the purchase.  </li>
            <li>Have had lots of positive feedback from my dental hygienist since I started using this product.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t been able to find these toothbrushes for a long time.</li>
            <li>I think the larger brush head is helping me brush more efficiently, getting more of my gums than other brushes.</li>
            <li>Once you get used to the larger brush, you can&#x27;t go to a smaller one.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to clean teeth much better.</li>
            <li>It covers a large part of your mouth when brushing.</li>
            <li>I have large teeth</li>
            <li>I have a large mouth, and I was very optimistic about this toothbrush, but I just didn&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really speeds up the cleaning time, I don&#x27;t tell you not to brush your teeth for three minutes</li>
            <li>This toothbrush really is the best!at</li>
            <li>but you really feel as if you&#x27;ve gotten your teeth cleaned at the dentist.</li>
            <li>Too big to fit in my mouth</li>
            <li>My teeth are so much cleaner</li>
            <li>You cover so much area at once that you dont feel like you have to stand there forever getting the job done.</li>
            <li>Really gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I really should have done as one reviewer suggested and used it for cleaning.</li>
            <li>I really like these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>you do the same, it is a good companion to your other brush(es).</li>
            <li>They fit well in your hand, (left and right choices!), and they last about six months.</li>
            <li>Other than that it was ok.</li>
            <li>Not only are my teeth clean but my gums feel...healthy.</li>
            <li>Once you start using it, you will not be able to go back to tiny toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>The brush is large, but soft.</li>
            <li>they seem big in your mouth at first but they brush a large area of teeth/gum with each stroke.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not hard on enamel or tender gums.</li>
            <li>They come in both left and right angle for whichever hand</li>
            <li>It even comes in left hand and right hand.  </li>
            <li>Already owned this toothbrush, just replacing it with a new one.</li>
            <li>This new toothbrush went from my bathroom to my tool box.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been seeing these in health food stores for some time and kind of thought they looked ridiculous.</li>
            <li>first it takes some getting use to as it is bigger than a normal toothbrush</li>
            <li>I would think anyone with TMJ wouldn&#x27;t be able to use this either, as it requires too much strain on opening your jaw to get this sucker in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>Since they&#x27;re so big, it really takes the time out of brushing and makes brushing easier since it covers so much surface area</li>
            <li>However, I kept trying to use it (and was more careful when brushing my back teeth) and soon got the hang of it.  </li>
            <li>more like a massage for your mouth than ordinary toothbrushes</li>
            <li>First week it was difficult to get used to, now I love it!</li>
            <li>My only problem is that it&#x27;s too big for my mouth that the brush can&#x27;t move around to clean well.</li>
            <li>In order to ensure that those areas were brushed, I had to &amp;#34;gag myself&amp;#34; with the over large head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t something that we typically get excited about when in need.</li>
            <li>Hard to find in stores lately, so glad to have found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I like them because the brush area is large enough to easily clean the whole mouth and soft enough to get into tight areas.</li>
            <li>also, the brush is soft</li>
            <li>Use a soft head.  </li>
            <li>I like to point that out because people are really into buying American product these days.</li>
            <li>Now he says that his teeth feel much cleaner now than before with a regular tooth brush.</li>
            <li>The bristles are really soft</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only is the area of bristles wide, but the bristles are thick, and they just feel so good when you are brushing!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t spend very long brushing, but feel the size of the brush means I do a very thorough job.  </li>
            <li>It feels gentle on my gums, yet cleans my teeth in half the time of a normal toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Takes a little getting used to at first, but now I could never go back to a &#x27;normal&#x27; toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I kept it up though, regularly jamming this thing as far back as it would go.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The large head made it very difficult to reach those parts of my teeth that were &amp;#34;behind&amp;#34;  like the two top last molars, or the inside bottom near the back.  </li>
            <li>Head is a little large for my mouth</li>

            <li> Cleans much better than any brush I have used so far.  </li>
            <li> Love the soft bristles and the ability to massage my gums.</li>
            <li> Out went the toothbrush, and I am back to my nice, compact head that reaches everywhere</li>
            <li> Right Handed, Colors</li>
            <li> I am right handed, so I got the right handed toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The bristles of this toothbrush are indeed the right consistency.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband who is a big fan and has been for many years of the Radius Toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> I was first introduced to the radius in the 90s.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to actually use either.  </li>
            <li> My teeth always feel much cleaner after use!</li>
            <li> and at first he was pissed about changing.</li>
            <li> love this big toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> I love the big head of bristles!  </li>
            <li> I switched after my first try.</li>
            <li> an dont have to stop brushing to add more toothpaste, as i have to do with smaller brushes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever be able to return to the skinny regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> On my first try I regretted the purchase.  </li>
            <li> Have had lots of positive feedback from my dental hygienist since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t been able to find these toothbrushes for a long time.</li>
            <li> I think the larger brush head is helping me brush more efficiently, getting more of my gums than other brushes.</li>
            <li> Once you get used to the larger brush, you can&#x27;t go to a smaller one.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to clean teeth much better.</li>
            <li> It covers a large part of your mouth when brushing.</li>
            <li> I have large teeth</li>
            <li> I have a large mouth, and I was very optimistic about this toothbrush, but I just didn&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really speeds up the cleaning time, I don&#x27;t tell you not to brush your teeth for three minutes</li>
            <li> This toothbrush really is the best!at</li>
            <li> but you really feel as if you&#x27;ve gotten your teeth cleaned at the dentist.</li>
            <li> Too big to fit in my mouth</li>
            <li> My teeth are so much cleaner</li>
            <li> You cover so much area at once that you dont feel like you have to stand there forever getting the job done.</li>
            <li> Really gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really should have done as one reviewer suggested and used it for cleaning.</li>
            <li> I really like these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> you do the same, it is a good companion to your other brush(es).</li>
            <li> They fit well in your hand, (left and right choices!), and they last about six months.</li>
            <li> Other than that it was ok.</li>
            <li> Not only are my teeth clean but my gums feel...healthy.</li>
            <li> Once you start using it, you will not be able to go back to tiny toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> The brush is large, but soft.</li>
            <li> they seem big in your mouth at first but they brush a large area of teeth/gum with each stroke.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not hard on enamel or tender gums.</li>
            <li> They come in both left and right angle for whichever hand</li>
            <li> It even comes in left hand and right hand.  </li>
            <li> Already owned this toothbrush, just replacing it with a new one.</li>
            <li> This new toothbrush went from my bathroom to my tool box.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been seeing these in health food stores for some time and kind of thought they looked ridiculous.</li>
            <li> first it takes some getting use to as it is bigger than a normal toothbrush</li>
            <li> I would think anyone with TMJ wouldn&#x27;t be able to use this either, as it requires too much strain on opening your jaw to get this sucker in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> Since they&#x27;re so big, it really takes the time out of brushing and makes brushing easier since it covers so much surface area</li>
            <li> However, I kept trying to use it (and was more careful when brushing my back teeth) and soon got the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> more like a massage for your mouth than ordinary toothbrushes</li>
            <li> First week it was difficult to get used to, now I love it!</li>
            <li> My only problem is that it&#x27;s too big for my mouth that the brush can&#x27;t move around to clean well.</li>
            <li> In order to ensure that those areas were brushed, I had to &amp;#34;gag myself&amp;#34; with the over large head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t something that we typically get excited about when in need.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores lately, so glad to have found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I like them because the brush area is large enough to easily clean the whole mouth and soft enough to get into tight areas.</li>
            <li> also, the brush is soft</li>
            <li> Use a soft head.  </li>
            <li> I like to point that out because people are really into buying American product these days.</li>
            <li> Now he says that his teeth feel much cleaner now than before with a regular tooth brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles are really soft</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only is the area of bristles wide, but the bristles are thick, and they just feel so good when you are brushing!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t spend very long brushing, but feel the size of the brush means I do a very thorough job.  </li>
            <li> It feels gentle on my gums, yet cleans my teeth in half the time of a normal toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to at first, but now I could never go back to a &#x27;normal&#x27; toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I kept it up though, regularly jamming this thing as far back as it would go.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The large head made it very difficult to reach those parts of my teeth that were &amp;#34;behind&amp;#34;  like the two top last molars, or the inside bottom near the back.  </li>
            <li> Head is a little large for my mouth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Radius toothbrushes for several years now and a ordinary toothbrush just will not do anymore, the brush is wonderfully large.</li>
            <li> This massive-head of a toothbrush has now made me wonder if there are people roaming the earth with large and excessive gaps of space around there gums, teeth and cheeks.</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and comparatively large teeth; four of which were removed to make way (with the aid of a bout with orthodontia) for wisdom teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Makes using a regular sized toothbrush feel like a waste of time (now seems like it takes way too long to brush teeth with my old brush, even my electric)</li>
            <li> the bristles were just a little too soft for my liking.&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I like the idea of this toothbrush, it&#x27;s a very large one and as someone with a small mouth, feels a little cumbersome.</li>
            <li> It does take some getting used to because they are bigger than any other toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The measurement of the brush head/bristles spans to a whopping 3/4 of an inch wide and a smidge over 1 1/2 inches long  vs  1/2 inch wide by 1 1/4 long oral-B toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a decade or so break, I have decided that I learned a hard lesson and vowed to use this new Radius correctly and sparingly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t really donate a toothbrush, so this was a poor purchase on my part.  </li>
            <li> as expected.</li>
            <li> I am not petite, but I do have TMJ, and apparently a small mouth because this was giant.  </li>
            <li> i have use the radius brushes for years and would not consider any other brand.</li>
            <li> Other toothbrushes don&#x27;t even come close in comparison to the Radius toothbrushes, I wont go back to using ordinary toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Would not use any other.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is very wide</li>
            <li> I hate dinky little brushes because they don&#x27;t give me a real clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> but it takes less time with this one.</li>
            <li> I have crowns and some black showed, since using the toothbrush the gums have covered the area.</li>
            <li> You use less toothpaste too, that saves money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just easier to use than the little bitty ones you get from the dentist.</li>
            <li> Tooth brushes are usually not very exciting.</li>
            <li> (Of course my mother-in-law mistook it for a small brush and cleaned my shower with it)</li>
            <li> Also the handle is not conducive to twisting around to reach hard to get places.</li>
            <li> but the bristles were a bit hard....</li>
            <li> For me, it is unnecessarily large, awkward and uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I have given packs of these to all my friends and family, and I mean ALL of them.  </li>
            <li> Alas.</li>
            <li> I had to learn how to not overuse this rather dramatic cleansing tool.</li>
            <li> Game Changer !</li>
            <li> However, it has become difficult to find.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Leave it to the hippies to come up with some awkward &#x27;improvement&#x27; on the toothbrush.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Since then I&#x27;ve told everyone I know that I was WRONG and that I AM THAT girl now!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent toothbrush!!</li>
            <li> greatest tooth and mouth cleaning product ever made.</li>
            <li> Very Nice.. Mine came in red. I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> On time.  This one I bought for hubby.</li>
            <li> The best toothbrush I have ever used. Brushes your gums too.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband who is a big fan and has been for many years of the Radius Toothbrushes.  He likes how big the brush is and the angle of the brush.</li>
            <li> Game Changer ! It really speeds up the cleaning time, I don&#x27;t tell you not to brush your teeth for three minutes but it takes less time with this one.</li>
            <li> The brush head is too big. Also the handle is not conducive to twisting around to reach hard to get places.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Radius toothbrushes for years. They are best toothbrushes it get a total cleaning on your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Can only use this brush.</li>
            <li> Tooth brushes are usually not very exciting. It isn&#x27;t something that we typically get excited about when in need. In fact, many times we buy the .99 special and call it perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Try this toothbrush...it will change your mind. The brush is large, but soft. It covers a large part of your mouth when brushing. Because it is large, I believe I am getting much better coverage and a great gum massage. buy one and you will be hooked.</li>
            <li> The soft version of this toothbrush is great. It feels gentle on my gums, yet cleans my teeth in half the time of a normal toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give these away as birthday presents, my mom jokingly asked if she was supposed to clean her shoes with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been seeing these in health food stores for some time and kind of thought they looked ridiculous. &amp;#34;Leave it to the hippies to come up with some awkward &#x27;improvement&#x27; on the toothbrush.&amp;#34; But for some reason every time I saw them I wanted to try them more and more...finally I bought one on Amazon (because I didn&#x27;t want to be &amp;#34;that&amp;#34; girl at the grocery) and FREAKING LOVED IT! I immediately ordered a second one and had it shipped to my best friend. Since then I&#x27;ve told everyone I know that I was WRONG and that I AM THAT girl now! It leaves your mouth feeling a LOT cleaner then regular toothbrushes. I&#x27;m surprised more dentists aren&#x27;t recommending these! Not only are my teeth clean but my gums feel...healthy. After taking my foot out of my mouth about the &amp;#34;hippie&amp;#34; thing, my Radius should clean it out just fine! :)</li>
            <li> I had to learn how to not overuse this rather dramatic cleansing tool. I was first introduced to the radius in the 90s. I was on a mission to have the best teeth possible. I brushed so aggressively that I had notches showing on my gums. My dentist scolded me on the danger I was doing, rather than some ultimate good. I had achieved white, sparkling teeth......but, at a detrimental price.&lt;br /&gt;In my all or nothing persona, I immediately stopped using and discarding the several Radius brushes I had acquired.&lt;br /&gt;After a decade or so break, I have decided that I learned a hard lesson and vowed to use this new Radius correctly and sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;If you do the same, it is a good companion to your other brush(es). However, it has become difficult to find.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush really is the best!at first it takes some getting use to as it is bigger than a normal toothbrush but you really feel as if you&#x27;ve gotten your teeth cleaned at the dentist.</li>
            <li> Shipment arrived on time and what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Excellent tool designed to improve teeth and gums plus eliminate bacterial build up.  A gentle dental toothbrush that feels good when brushing, without harming your gums.  Radius put some thought into this toothbrush - right/left handed.  Try it, you&#x27;ll see the difference.</li>
            <li> I use an electric toothbrush at night, for a thorough job. This one is my morning toothbrush. It&#x27;s just easier to use than the little bitty ones you get from the dentist.</li>
            <li> Already owned this toothbrush, just replacing it with a new one. Is the best one I&#x27;ve ever had, you should try it.</li>
            <li> love them great size cleans more area faster</li>
            <li> I love these toothbrushes! It does take some getting used to because they are bigger than any other toothbrush. I have had much better dental visits since I started using the Radius!</li>
            <li> This is a regular purchase</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used and enjoyed these great toothbrushes for years and given them to family members for gifts.  Keep &#x27;em coming.</li>
            <li> Second one I&#x27;ve purchased for a friend - says it&#x27;s the cleanest his teeth have ever felt!</li>
            <li> I LOVE these toothbrushes! I&#x27;ve been using them for years! (Of course my mother-in-law mistook it for a small brush and cleaned my shower with it)</li>
            <li> Too big!  I am not petite, but I do have TMJ, and apparently a small mouth because this was giant.  So giant, in fact, that I couldn&#x27;t even reach my teeth.  I loved the idea of a toothbrush that wasn&#x27;t as disposable, and also an ergonomic handle.  I wasn&#x27;t able to actually use either.  Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t really donate a toothbrush, so this was a poor purchase on my part.  I would think anyone with TMJ wouldn&#x27;t be able to use this either, as it requires too much strain on opening your jaw to get this sucker in your mouth.  Alas.</li>
            <li> I have a large mouth, and I was very optimistic about this toothbrush, but I just didn&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The large head made it very difficult to reach those parts of my teeth that were &amp;#34;behind&amp;#34;  like the two top last molars, or the inside bottom near the back.  In order to ensure that those areas were brushed, I had to &amp;#34;gag myself&amp;#34; with the over large head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also didn&#x27;t feel like the surface of my teeth felt as clean as I liked-- the bristles were just a little too soft for my liking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the cost of this unique toothbrush, and the gag factor made me not want to replace.</li>
            <li> Too big to fit in my mouth</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand for 25 years. My teeth are so much cleaner and my gums are healthy. Even my denist asked how I keep my tartar under control so well.</li>
            <li> Nice  toothbrush. I would like it if you could get more than one with the package.</li>
            <li> Once you have this toothbrush you will never go back to a regular one!</li>
            <li> covers a lot of territory and is comfortable to use.  i have use the radius brushes for years and would not consider any other brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Radius toothbrushes for several years now and a ordinary toothbrush just will not do anymore, the brush is wonderfully large.</li>
            <li> I have crowns and some black showed, since using the toothbrush the gums have covered the area.</li>
            <li> Make brushing a breeze and simple.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these Radius toothbrushes for about 8 years now. They&#x27;re wonderful because they&#x27;re large so you can brush your teeth a fraction of the normal time. They fit well in your hand, (left and right choices!), and they last about six months.</li>
            <li> Other toothbrushes don&#x27;t even come close in comparison to the Radius toothbrushes, I wont go back to using ordinary toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> This new toothbrush went from my bathroom to my tool box.  I&#x27;m going to use it for anything but my teeth. For me, it is unnecessarily large, awkward and uncomfortable.  Overkill.  An attempt to re-invent, which we see happening all the time, as more time passes by.  This massive-head of a toothbrush has now made me wonder if there are people roaming the earth with large and excessive gaps of space around there gums, teeth and cheeks. Or maybe I&#x27;m thinking of a horse.  I&#x27;m done with that thought now and I know that this brush will serve a better purpose....like when I detail my car.&lt;br /&gt;It seemed to be quality made, but so is my oral-B.  The measurement of the brush head/bristles spans to a whopping 3/4 of an inch wide and a smidge over 1 1/2 inches long  vs  1/2 inch wide by 1 1/4 long oral-B toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Now go measure the length of your teeth and quickly figure out that you&#x27;re not a horse.</li>
            <li> While I like the idea of this toothbrush, it&#x27;s a very large one and as someone with a small mouth, feels a little cumbersome. If they had a kids size, that might work better for me. The bristles do have a good texture and I do use it but as compared to my Sonicare, it feels like a mouth full.</li>
            <li> Once you get used to the larger brush, you can&#x27;t go to a smaller one.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to clean teeth much better.</li>
            <li> more like a massage for your mouth than ordinary toothbrushes</li>
            <li> This is a huge toothbrush but it is by far the best brush I have ever owned.  You cover so much area at once that you dont feel like you have to stand there forever getting the job done.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is very wide so it covers tooth &amp; gum as I brush.  I can get the job done a lot quicker while massaging my gums at the same time.</li>
            <li> I have found a favorite!</li>
            <li> Have had lots of positive feedback from my dental hygienist since I started using this product. Takes a little getting used to at first, but now I could never go back to a &#x27;normal&#x27; toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Love recycled and quality products.</li>
            <li> I have used these for years and I buy them for my children, too (the child sizes).  they seem big in your mouth at first but they brush a large area of teeth/gum with each stroke.  also, the brush is soft so it&#x27;s not hard on enamel or tender gums.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush ever.  Once you start using it, you will not be able to go back to tiny toothbrushes.  I love using it because it get the coverage I am looking for quickly.  I have all my teeth and I&#x27;m 72 and it pays to brush.</li>
            <li> I like the way it is angled and the head is a good size for my mouth.  I hate dinky little brushes because they don&#x27;t give me a real clean feeling.  This type and brand of brush is the only one I use.  I stumbled upon it in a Texas supermarket and have been sold on it since.  Now I Amazon it and get it when I need it.  One last me almost 6 months using it twice daily.  Cleans much better than any brush I have used so far.  Plus I don&#x27;t have time to stand and use an electric one with a dinky head on it either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you try one, you&#x27;ll wonder why you didn&#x27;t find it sooner.  Use a soft head.  They come in both left and right angle for whichever hand you use most often.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t been able to find these toothbrushes for a long time. I was delighted to find them on Amazon. A regular toothbrush seems inefficient when you use this.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. Really gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Perfect, if you have horse teeth and no gag reflux!</li>
            <li> I have been using Radius Toothbrushes for years. I like them because the brush area is large enough to easily clean the whole mouth and soft enough to get into tight areas.</li>
            <li> These are the best toothbrushes. My teeth always feel much cleaner after use! I will never go back to a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; toothbrush again. It&#x27;s daunting when you first see how huge the bristle area is. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would fit easily in my mouth, but it does. The company is also based in Pennsylvania and it&#x27;s an American made product. I like to point that out because people are really into buying American product these days. I made my husband use it and at first he was pissed about changing. Now he says that his teeth feel much cleaner now than before with a regular tooth brush. The bristles are really soft so you don&#x27;t have to worry about your gums getting cut.  I recommend this toothbrush to everyone.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. Would not use any other.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!! My second time using one~ its amazing!!</li>
            <li> Love these. Since they&#x27;re so big, it really takes the time out of brushing and makes brushing easier since it covers so much surface area</li>
            <li> Robert Redford carries his Radius and after eating... it is put to good use..I think i am going stop and brush my teeth!</li>
            <li> I met the owner of this company on an airplane many years ago and he sent me a free toothbrush.  I was hooked.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 15 years and I love it.  My dental hygienist always says my gums are in great condition and I credit the toothbrush.  I don&#x27;t spend very long brushing, but feel the size of the brush means I do a very thorough job.  Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Have loved this toothbrush for many years. Hard to find in stores lately, so glad to have found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I use this toothbrush every day and I love it, makes your mouth feel so clean and it cleans the gums as you brush. I got some to give to friends.  You use less toothpaste too, that saves money.</li>
            <li> Radius Toothbrush, Right Handed, Colors May Vary.  I picked yellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this big toothbrush!  It feels like it is cleaning your teeth and gums really good!  When I brought it home, I was asked &amp;#34;Is your mouth that big?&amp;#34;  It is awesome.  I love the big head of bristles!  It feels so good on your teeth and gums.  I love the toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a toothbrush/teeth person.  So when I saw this big toothbrush, I just had to try it.  I love it and will use it until it wears out.  It even comes in left hand and right hand.  I am right handed, so I got the right handed toothbrush.  I picked out yellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is the area of bristles wide, but the bristles are thick, and they just feel so good when you are brushing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t want to miss this brush!  I think you would like it!.</li>
            <li> Went from cleaning apt. Every three months to twice a year l  have way&lt;br /&gt;Less  receiding of gums.</li>
            <li> I use it to massage my gums, and it is perfect for that! It keeps my gums healthy.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  I use them exclusively now and threw away my electric brush.  I have given packs of these to all my friends and family, and I mean ALL of them.  It&#x27;s like a massage for your teeth and gums, so using it is enjoyable, and every time I go to the dentist he remarks on how clean my teeth are.  I LOVE THIS TOOTHBRUSH and I&#x27;m going to brush my teeth right now!</li>
            <li> Love this Toothbrush. I wood buy this again</li>
            <li> First week it was difficult to get used to, now I love it!</li>
            <li> have used the radius for years, love them and so does my dentist!!</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Very functional design&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gently massage your gums as you brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sprisingly quick brush times&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thoroughly brushes leaving cleanest feeling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Large head and ergonomic handle (takes a couple of weeks getting used to)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes going back to a regular toothbrush feel uncivilized&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes using a regular sized toothbrush feel like a waste of time (now seems like it takes way too long to brush teeth with my old brush, even my electric)</li>
            <li> Satisfied with my purchase. Comfortable in my hand. Head is a little large for my mouth but I think I just need to get used to it. Love the soft bristles and the ability to massage my gums.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts, but decided to give it a try. I have a small mouth and comparatively large teeth; four of which were removed to make way (with the aid of a bout with orthodontia) for wisdom teeth. The bristles of this toothbrush are indeed the right consistency. The size of the head, as I suspected, was a problem for getting at the back teeth. I kept it up though, regularly jamming this thing as far back as it would go. My next dental visit was the eye-opener. After years of praise for good oral health habits, for the first time ever there were pockets of bacteria around my wisdom teeth. Out went the toothbrush, and I am back to my nice, compact head that reaches everywhere I need it to. I really should have done as one reviewer suggested and used it for cleaning. I bet it would make a great scrubber for smaller areas. Never again.</li>
            <li> I think the produce is ok....but the bristles were a bit hard....need softer bristles/brush.  Other than that it was ok.</li>
            <li> Try it out! Very different from any toothbrush you&#x27;ve ever used. I switched after my first try. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this brush with the large head. I have large teeth an dont have to stop brushing to add more toothpaste, as i have to do with smaller brushes.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush.  My only problem is that it&#x27;s too big for my mouth that the brush can&#x27;t move around to clean well.</li>
            <li> I really like these toothbrushes. Don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever be able to return to the skinny regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading a rave review of how efficient these toothbrushes are.  On my first try I regretted the purchase.  The head of the toothbrush is so much bigger than a regular toothbrush that it quite literally made me gag.  However, I kept trying to use it (and was more careful when brushing my back teeth) and soon got the hang of it.  Now I&#x27;m used to the size of the brush and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  I think the larger brush head is helping me brush more efficiently, getting more of my gums than other brushes.</li>
            <li> as expected. will order again</li>
