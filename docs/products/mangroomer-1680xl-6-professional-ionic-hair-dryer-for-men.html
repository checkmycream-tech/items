            <li>That being said, this is the best hairdryer I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Excellent buy!</li>
            <li>so I was very happy to get this one!</li>
            <li>I will admit that this is one of the best hairdryers that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I have been impressed with it.</li>
            <li>I have had it for a couple months now, and it still works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>man groomer hair dryer is perfect for women too!</li>
            <li>Good product and quite!</li>
            <li>my hair can fly into the works and get tangled.</li>
            <li>Works great, even with traveling a lot it still isn&#x27;t too bulky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great hair dryer, for men or women.</li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>Great hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that, it is nothing remarkable.</li>
            <li>Mangroomer is a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>But, even though this hair dryer does not do that it is still a good product.  </li>
            <li>It looks good and feels good.</li>
            <li>My wife and daughter have been using it as well despite the \\&quot;Mangroomer\\&quot; name and they seem to think it does a good job as well.</li>
            <li>I loved the power on this</li>
            <li>It is substantial weight and feels good in the hands.  </li>
            <li>Good for now though.</li>
            <li>Good quality product.</li>
            <li>It performs exceptionally well</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s highest and warmest setting, and I am very pleased with the performance of this dryer in that regard.</li>
            <li>It has good speed, nice heat, and durability.  </li>
            <li>It worked well, looks nice in the bathroom and is a good value.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Marketing angle aside, I liked the tool.  </li>
            <li>She said, \\&quot;That was the best experience I&#x27;ve ever had with any hairdryer in my whole</li>
            <li>Nice color combination.</li>
            <li>It has all the features that my own hair dryer comes with.</li>
            <li>Quite a nice product.</li>
            <li>I have to be completely honest in saying that, I don&#x27;t understand why this hairdryer is solely being marketed towards men.</li>
            <li>dryer itself is very functional and excellent.  </li>
            <li>With heat settings and a nice grip as well.  </li>
            <li>But, since my wife has a hairdryer to be honest</li>
            <li>and I got this hairdryer for my own use (my hubby is bald).  </li>
            <li>works great, looks cool</li>
            <li>It has a good weight and a comfortable handle which I quite appreciate</li>
            <li>It is the best I have used so far.</li>
            <li>The surface material is great - it is cool to the touch even when it is on \\&quot;hot\\&quot; and my shoulder-length hair is frizz free after a Ion drying session.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this hair dryer and although it was designed for men, I use it on my own long hair and love it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know, because none of those things make it a better tool for drying a man&#x27;s hair than a woman&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>told, I found this to be a good tool and absolutely worth the price asked.</li>
            <li>Love this dryer.</li>
            <li>Most of the features go way beyond my needs.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>sure what the point of the ion setting is all about</li>
            <li>Worthwhile.</li>
            <li>I love the look of this hair dryer, so I guess they knew what they were doing when they marketed it to men.</li>
            <li>I would have to say that this is psychological advertising at its best!</li>
            <li>It is definitely built like a man LOL!</li>
            <li>He thought the dryer was sleek looking, more manly than the \\&quot;girl\\&quot; hairdryer he has been using.  </li>
            <li>there are alot more bald men than women, b)</li>
            <li>and I am thoroughly satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>This calls for a more even application of heat so</li>
            <li>In that scenario I think it&#x27;s probably okay</li>
            <li>What more can you say about a hairdryer?</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>It has the functions I need and nothing more.</li>
            <li>like the design of this hairdryer---it&#x27;s fairly light, comfortable to hold, and the attachment nozzle is nice for focusing the air where I want it.</li>
            <li>It may look manly but it doesn&#x27;t feel like it, being very light weight and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>and then) I&#x27;m sure it would be fine for her use as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Second, it doesn&#x27;t blow to the point of feeling singed on my scalp but the power is still very good.</li>
            <li>Why not Black and Navy?&amp;#34; Lol.</li>
            <li>It is definitely more attractive than all the standard bathroom beige and blandness.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t overheat and it dries hair very quickly, even longer hair like mine.  </li>
            <li>Strong and sturdy.</li>
            <li>This hairdryer works fine.  </li>
            <li>This hairdryer works just fine for women too.</li>
            <li>I nice strong motor and many settings to please nearly everyone.  </li>
            <li>A huge plus to this hairdryer is the speed in which it dries your hair.  </li>
            <li>With the air atttachment you have a huge blast of air.  </li>
            <li>so I often have difficulty with the handles on larger dryers, but this one is a great size</li>
            <li>I did not expect to actually enjoy a hair dryer.</li>
            <li>This has a smooth, perforated end cap that appears resistant to those issues.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really powerful, so many speeds and temps for that styling look.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this product.</li>
            <li>On top of the high quality drying it delivers, it is also very comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>it works great and there is a cool ion switch and blue light on it.  </li>
            <li>give it four out of five stars, because it&#x27;s okay for a guy to like a blow dryer, but \\&quot;unmanly\\&quot; for a guy to \\&quot;love\\&quot; one.ive it four out of five stars, because it&#x27;s okay for a guy to like a blow dryer, but probably not only unnatural, but more importantly, \\&quot;unmanly\\&quot; for a guy to \\&quot;love\\&quot; his blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Oh sure, my husband can use it whenever he wants, but this is now *mine*!</li>
            <li>I was extremely excited to try out this product</li>
            <li>It has a nice, forceful wind that dried my hair in good time.</li>
            <li>Summary: function good enough</li>
            <li>hairdryer does the job and looks cool doing it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the official name is) at the back of the hair dryer is way superior to any hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever had that has a wire end cap.</li>
            <li>I think they are calling it a Mangroomer since it looks really cool.</li>
            <li>The cord length is appropriate and does not interfere with my morning routine of getting ready and singing along to Katy Perry in the mirror and imagining myself at Madison Square Garden.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Mangroomer\\&quot; aspect is more of a marketing thing than any realistic specification for this hairdryer.</li>
            <li>really sure the magical ion feature actually does anything.&lt;br /&gt;-Annoying</li>
            <li>Being a bit of a procrastinator when it comes tto getting haircuts, my hair tends to get fairly long between cuts and this dryer worked quickly and did a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a frequent hair dryer user, but it&#x27;s always good to have one around.</li>
            <li>I still don&#x27;t know what all the ionization stuff means; all I want to do is dry my hair quickly and have it feel good.</li>
            <li>I found the settings easy to adjust and was pleased with the extra volume</li>
            <li>It is extremely powerful, but it doesn&#x27;t get too hot or overheat if I don&#x27;t move it constantly, a nice feature that many other dryers I&#x27;ve used don&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really understand that process, but if that&#x27;s important to you - the feature does just what it says.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t quite have the bathroom real estate available to store two hairdryers.  </li>
            <li>it looks pretty cool and not feminine.</li>
            <li>I rarely use a hair dryer when I am away from home</li>
            <li>I liked the solid construction and the firmness of the controls.</li>
            <li>nice to finally have a hair dryer built for guys.</li>
            <li>The grip is nice and feels solid to hold.</li>
            <li>It makes me laugh that this product is touted specifically for men.  </li>
            <li>Makes me laugh.  </li>
            <li>Still though, worth buying.</li>
            <li>I found the weight of the dryer to be light enough that it is comfortable to hold for a while, a good benefit for those of us with long hair.</li>
            <li>The bright red and black design is appealing -- clean, bold and well-shaped.</li>
            <li>The ionic technology is also used on my flat iron, which is a nice plus to keep frizz at bay.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get warm enough, or gets too hot...</li>
            <li>I love the colors, black and red and the accessory attachment works great.</li>
            <li>I use the ionic setting with the heat on high, and control the amount of hot air with the handy \\&quot;cool burst\\&quot; blue button that turns the heat off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a woman I&#x27;m not using the little blue button; regardless, this is an awesome piece of equipment.</li>
            <li>It is more powerful than the hairdryer that I just recently tossed into the trash.</li>
            <li>The coating on the dryer is very nice, making it not so slick and easier to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really does blast the heat, and air too, so drying is pretty quick.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very much a matter of</li>
            <li>I wear it long and braided so I can ignore it as much as possible, and so it doesn&#x27;t fly around all the time and get tangled in stuff or end up in people&#x27;s food.  </li>
            <li>I could be that my hair is too short to have much static electricity issues or it&#x27;s just a marketing ploy.</li>
            <li>This is my first hair dryer,so have no experience but looks like a quality product.</li>
            <li>First, I am a woman</li>
            <li>I wanted a no-frills, sturdy hairdryer, and that&#x27;s exactly what I got.</li>
            <li>It is bigger and slightly heavier than my old drier, but has a good rubber grip, quiet motor, and a fun bright color scheme.</li>
            <li>Higher settings may be better suited for long hair.</li>
            <li>In my usage I actually found it to be a good hairdryer - it does the job blowing my short hair around any which way I chose.  </li>
            <li>For me, this hairdryer makes a positive difference (pun intended) on my hair.</li>
            <li>I love the long cord as that provides some flexibility.  </li>
            <li>Fast and hot.  </li>
            <li>Another important thing to note is in comparison to my hairdryer the air does not get as hot, personally I think this is why the hair feels softer and more manageable than when I use the other hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>The design is attractive and I guess a little manlier than the standard hairdryer?</li>
            <li>The little detachable nozzle is nice too, as leaving it on focuses the air better, but I took it off once when I need to work some duckback oilskin treatment into my oilskin coat (no, really).  </li>
            <li>Most blowdryers have hard plastic handles that can slip easily (especially after a shower) but this one has a nice rubber texture to it.</li>
            <li>To that end it does the job as you&#x27;d expect with a reasonable range of temperature and fan settings.  </li>
            <li>but if you must be Mangroomed then this model shouldn&#x27;t disappoint much.</li>
            <li>I like this tool, but I really don&#x27;t get the \\&quot;Mangroomer\\&quot; marketing angle.  </li>
            <li>The hairdryer itself does the job well and dries the hair fast.</li>
            <li>It is also very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky with my blowdryers.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It has so much power that I don&#x27;t have to spend an hour drying my hair.</li>
            <li>but it all sounds very scientific</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t really dock them a star for that oversight, I guess.</li>
            <li>Outside of the sporty color that may seem more masculine or the fact that it&#x27;s inscribed with MANGROOMER on the side of it doesn&#x27;t change the functionality of the dryer itself.</li>
            <li>, quality high enough; design a nice extra</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hot when you set it on &#x27;High&#x27;, and cools quickly when you hold the blue button.</li>
            <li>BECAUSE IT REALLY IS HIGH POWERED AND FAST DRYING</li>
            <li>It has plenty of heat and power, runs fairly quiet and has all the usual features - high and low speed, warm and hot heat, a cool air burst button, and even ionic technology (for what that is worth), etc.  </li>
            <li>but if you want to dry / style your hair it should work just fine.</li>
            <li>I was able to get using the dryer on wet hair - and how fast this works, especially on the top heat setting, even for someone with really long hair.  </li>
            <li>Now can we go back to talking about how cool it looks?</li>
            <li>It has various heat, speed settings, a cool air button.</li>
            <li>The Ion button is located on the side of the barrel with a cool blue button indicator.  </li>
            <li>It comes with a plastic attachment to focus the air stream in a particular pattern.  </li>
            <li>It seems that is just an attempt at clever marketing</li>
            <li>Despite its otherwise respectable construction the lack of cord recoil makes it functionally inferior to my [[ASIN:B000R80ZTQ Infiniti 223XR Dryer]] and between the two of them I would never be able to tell you which hair dryer I had used in an extended blind study.  </li>
            <li>: First, the heat doesn&#x27;t seem as hot as with my girl&#x27;s hairdryer which makes sense for a man since the cuts are much different.</li>
            <li>This one is \\&quot;manly\\&quot; enough that you&#x27;ll look cool using it, and can leave it laying around without your date thinking you have a live in girlfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>THIS DRYER IS EXTREMELY HIGH POWERED.</li>
            <li>The red and black combo really looks nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice hairdryer and does the same job like hundreds of other hairdryers on the market.</li>
            <li>As someone who regards his hair as stuff that sits on top of my head and needs to be kept in some semblance of tidiness, a grooming product is of little interest to me.</li>
            <li>The Mangroomer is a large yet lightweight dryer that provides quiet and powerful hair drying action.</li>
            <li>things considered I don&#x27;t think this hair dryer is worth double that of alternatives</li>
            <li>I am a woman and my favorite color in the whole wide world is red</li>
            <li>I normally set the blow dryer to</li>
            <li>I did laugh at the target branding to the Male Population for this \\&quot;Mangroomer\\&quot;</li>
            <li>IT IS SOMEWHAT HEAVY, BUT I LOVE THE GRIP OF IT AND</li>
            <li>He thought the Mangroomer felt good and solid in his hands-light weight and dries his hair no different than any other hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are adequate, yet limited, heat and speed settings and it is powerful enough.  </li>
            <li>I like the Ion feature and the cool air boost button and the unique black and red colors.  </li>
            <li>I needed a new dryer, this would fill the bill.</li>
            <li>plus I needed a new one</li>
            <li>I was tempted by the Mangroomer because I needed a new hair dryer.</li>
            <li>It pushes a lot of air to dry quickly.  </li>
            <li>I guess they felt this was an under-served market even though the total available market (tam) for men is probably much smaller than the women&#x27;s market when considering that a)</li>
            <li>The thing does its job, but its not a professional as it seems, The air does become hot but the amount of air it blows out isn&#x27;t fast like those in the barbershops and salons.</li>
            <li>alot of men barely comb there hair so they certainly don&#x27;t blowdry it, and c)</li>
            <li>It has multiple heat settings, multiple speed settings, a cool blast button, an ionization button you can toggle on and off, and a removable end-cap you can use to focus the airflow.  </li>
            <li>The Mangroomer 1680XL-6 did a good job drying my long, thick hair, although not any faster than my old dryer.  </li>
            <li>At its core this is a decent general purpose hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>It drys my hair quickly unlike my other hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>but given that it does work I can only knock it so much.  </li>
            <li>Has all the features of a professional hair dryer.</li>
            <li>He has never used a hairdryer on his hair because he wears his hair close to the scalp or completely bald.</li>
            <li>B006BNFXHU Mangroomer 1680XL-6 Professional Ionic Hair Dryer for Men]]</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t personally use the add-on attachment, so I can&#x27;t comment on it, but it seems like it would be a useful tool for those who needed that specific form of styling.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no reason women can&#x27;t use this dryer as well, since Male and Female hair is pretty much the same.  </li>
            <li>There was a cold hot button, which is nice when you are done to &#x27;set&#x27; the style.</li>
            <li>Because of the little blue light that comes on when you turn on the Ion button?  </li>
            <li>yes, I suppose I should mention, it really does dry your hair.</li>
            <li>This apparently sets your hair after it has been styled?</li>
            <li>... and if you&#x27;re not careful, she just might steal it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it isn&#x27;t too loud at the same time.</li>
            <li>dryer has completely stopped working for no reason after 5 months of daily use (it was not damaged in any way).  </li>
            <li>I contend that a real manly hair dryer would actually shoot fire into your hair to dry it.  </li>
            <li>In comparison to my 1 year old Remington hairdryer, the main handle is wider and less \\&quot;fitted\\&quot; to the hand.  </li>
            <li>Overall I found this dryer to be well built, powerful unit though a bit on the heavy side.  </li>
            <li>It always seems like they&#x27;re either too hot, not hot enough, or don&#x27;t give enough pressure to mold my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair and scalp have not undergone any change in recent weeks that I wouldn&#x27;t attribute to weather and the general rigors of being a dude with hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also really like using the ion button as it makes my hair less frizzy</li>
            <li>So I have very short hair, and as a rule, just let it dry naturally, however, my wife has LOTS of hair, and she loves this thing.  </li>
            <li>Most hairdryers are really hard on my hair, so I use them as little as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> That being said, this is the best hairdryer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Excellent buy!</li>
            <li> so I was very happy to get this one!</li>
            <li> I will admit that this is one of the best hairdryers that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I have been impressed with it.</li>
            <li> I have had it for a couple months now, and it still works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> man groomer hair dryer is perfect for women too!</li>
            <li> Good product and quite!</li>
            <li> my hair can fly into the works and get tangled.</li>
            <li> Works great, even with traveling a lot it still isn&#x27;t too bulky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great hair dryer, for men or women.</li>
            <li> LOL</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than that, it is nothing remarkable.</li>
            <li> Mangroomer is a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> But, even though this hair dryer does not do that it is still a good product.  </li>
            <li> It looks good and feels good.</li>
            <li> My wife and daughter have been using it as well despite the \\&quot;Mangroomer\\&quot; name and they seem to think it does a good job as well.</li>
            <li> I loved the power on this</li>
            <li> It is substantial weight and feels good in the hands.  </li>
            <li> Good for now though.</li>
            <li> Good quality product.</li>
            <li> It performs exceptionally well</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s highest and warmest setting, and I am very pleased with the performance of this dryer in that regard.</li>
            <li> It has good speed, nice heat, and durability.  </li>
            <li> It worked well, looks nice in the bathroom and is a good value.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Marketing angle aside, I liked the tool.  </li>
            <li> She said, \\&quot;That was the best experience I&#x27;ve ever had with any hairdryer in my whole</li>
            <li> Nice color combination.</li>
            <li> It has all the features that my own hair dryer comes with.</li>
            <li> Quite a nice product.</li>
            <li> I have to be completely honest in saying that, I don&#x27;t understand why this hairdryer is solely being marketed towards men.</li>
            <li> dryer itself is very functional and excellent.  </li>
            <li> With heat settings and a nice grip as well.  </li>
            <li> But, since my wife has a hairdryer to be honest</li>
            <li> and I got this hairdryer for my own use (my hubby is bald).  </li>
            <li> works great, looks cool</li>
            <li> It has a good weight and a comfortable handle which I quite appreciate</li>
            <li> It is the best I have used so far.</li>
            <li> The surface material is great - it is cool to the touch even when it is on \\&quot;hot\\&quot; and my shoulder-length hair is frizz free after a Ion drying session.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this hair dryer and although it was designed for men, I use it on my own long hair and love it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, because none of those things make it a better tool for drying a man&#x27;s hair than a woman&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> told, I found this to be a good tool and absolutely worth the price asked.</li>
            <li> Love this dryer.</li>
            <li> Most of the features go way beyond my needs.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> sure what the point of the ion setting is all about</li>
            <li> Worthwhile.</li>
            <li> I love the look of this hair dryer, so I guess they knew what they were doing when they marketed it to men.</li>
            <li> I would have to say that this is psychological advertising at its best!</li>
            <li> It is definitely built like a man LOL!</li>
            <li> He thought the dryer was sleek looking, more manly than the \\&quot;girl\\&quot; hairdryer he has been using.  </li>
            <li> there are alot more bald men than women, b)</li>
            <li> and I am thoroughly satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> This calls for a more even application of heat so</li>
            <li> In that scenario I think it&#x27;s probably okay</li>
            <li> What more can you say about a hairdryer?</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> It has the functions I need and nothing more.</li>
            <li> like the design of this hairdryer---it&#x27;s fairly light, comfortable to hold, and the attachment nozzle is nice for focusing the air where I want it.</li>
            <li> It may look manly but it doesn&#x27;t feel like it, being very light weight and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> and then) I&#x27;m sure it would be fine for her use as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Second, it doesn&#x27;t blow to the point of feeling singed on my scalp but the power is still very good.</li>
            <li> Why not Black and Navy?&amp;#34; Lol.</li>
            <li> It is definitely more attractive than all the standard bathroom beige and blandness.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t overheat and it dries hair very quickly, even longer hair like mine.  </li>
            <li> Strong and sturdy.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer works fine.  </li>
            <li> This hairdryer works just fine for women too.</li>
            <li> I nice strong motor and many settings to please nearly everyone.  </li>
            <li> A huge plus to this hairdryer is the speed in which it dries your hair.  </li>
            <li> With the air atttachment you have a huge blast of air.  </li>
            <li> so I often have difficulty with the handles on larger dryers, but this one is a great size</li>
            <li> I did not expect to actually enjoy a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This has a smooth, perforated end cap that appears resistant to those issues.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really powerful, so many speeds and temps for that styling look.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this product.</li>
            <li> On top of the high quality drying it delivers, it is also very comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> it works great and there is a cool ion switch and blue light on it.  </li>
            <li> give it four out of five stars, because it&#x27;s okay for a guy to like a blow dryer, but \\&quot;unmanly\\&quot; for a guy to \\&quot;love\\&quot; one.ive it four out of five stars, because it&#x27;s okay for a guy to like a blow dryer, but probably not only unnatural, but more importantly, \\&quot;unmanly\\&quot; for a guy to \\&quot;love\\&quot; his blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Oh sure, my husband can use it whenever he wants, but this is now *mine*!</li>
            <li> I was extremely excited to try out this product</li>
            <li> It has a nice, forceful wind that dried my hair in good time.</li>
            <li> Summary: function good enough</li>
            <li> hairdryer does the job and looks cool doing it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the official name is) at the back of the hair dryer is way superior to any hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever had that has a wire end cap.</li>
            <li> I think they are calling it a Mangroomer since it looks really cool.</li>
            <li> The cord length is appropriate and does not interfere with my morning routine of getting ready and singing along to Katy Perry in the mirror and imagining myself at Madison Square Garden.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Mangroomer\\&quot; aspect is more of a marketing thing than any realistic specification for this hairdryer.</li>
            <li> really sure the magical ion feature actually does anything.&lt;br /&gt;-Annoying</li>
            <li> Being a bit of a procrastinator when it comes tto getting haircuts, my hair tends to get fairly long between cuts and this dryer worked quickly and did a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a frequent hair dryer user, but it&#x27;s always good to have one around.</li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t know what all the ionization stuff means; all I want to do is dry my hair quickly and have it feel good.</li>
            <li> I found the settings easy to adjust and was pleased with the extra volume</li>
            <li> It is extremely powerful, but it doesn&#x27;t get too hot or overheat if I don&#x27;t move it constantly, a nice feature that many other dryers I&#x27;ve used don&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really understand that process, but if that&#x27;s important to you - the feature does just what it says.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t quite have the bathroom real estate available to store two hairdryers.  </li>
            <li> it looks pretty cool and not feminine.</li>
            <li> I rarely use a hair dryer when I am away from home</li>
            <li> I liked the solid construction and the firmness of the controls.</li>
            <li> nice to finally have a hair dryer built for guys.</li>
            <li> The grip is nice and feels solid to hold.</li>
            <li> It makes me laugh that this product is touted specifically for men.  </li>
            <li> Makes me laugh.  </li>
            <li> Still though, worth buying.</li>
            <li> I found the weight of the dryer to be light enough that it is comfortable to hold for a while, a good benefit for those of us with long hair.</li>
            <li> The bright red and black design is appealing -- clean, bold and well-shaped.</li>
            <li> The ionic technology is also used on my flat iron, which is a nice plus to keep frizz at bay.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get warm enough, or gets too hot...</li>
            <li> I love the colors, black and red and the accessory attachment works great.</li>
            <li> I use the ionic setting with the heat on high, and control the amount of hot air with the handy \\&quot;cool burst\\&quot; blue button that turns the heat off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman I&#x27;m not using the little blue button; regardless, this is an awesome piece of equipment.</li>
            <li> It is more powerful than the hairdryer that I just recently tossed into the trash.</li>
            <li> The coating on the dryer is very nice, making it not so slick and easier to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really does blast the heat, and air too, so drying is pretty quick.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very much a matter of</li>
            <li> I wear it long and braided so I can ignore it as much as possible, and so it doesn&#x27;t fly around all the time and get tangled in stuff or end up in people&#x27;s food.  </li>
            <li> I could be that my hair is too short to have much static electricity issues or it&#x27;s just a marketing ploy.</li>
            <li> This is my first hair dryer,so have no experience but looks like a quality product.</li>
            <li> First, I am a woman</li>
            <li> I wanted a no-frills, sturdy hairdryer, and that&#x27;s exactly what I got.</li>
            <li> It is bigger and slightly heavier than my old drier, but has a good rubber grip, quiet motor, and a fun bright color scheme.</li>
            <li> Higher settings may be better suited for long hair.</li>
            <li> In my usage I actually found it to be a good hairdryer - it does the job blowing my short hair around any which way I chose.  </li>
            <li> For me, this hairdryer makes a positive difference (pun intended) on my hair.</li>
            <li> I love the long cord as that provides some flexibility.  </li>
            <li> Fast and hot.  </li>
            <li> Another important thing to note is in comparison to my hairdryer the air does not get as hot, personally I think this is why the hair feels softer and more manageable than when I use the other hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> The design is attractive and I guess a little manlier than the standard hairdryer?</li>
            <li> The little detachable nozzle is nice too, as leaving it on focuses the air better, but I took it off once when I need to work some duckback oilskin treatment into my oilskin coat (no, really).  </li>
            <li> Most blowdryers have hard plastic handles that can slip easily (especially after a shower) but this one has a nice rubber texture to it.</li>
            <li> To that end it does the job as you&#x27;d expect with a reasonable range of temperature and fan settings.  </li>
            <li> but if you must be Mangroomed then this model shouldn&#x27;t disappoint much.</li>
            <li> I like this tool, but I really don&#x27;t get the \\&quot;Mangroomer\\&quot; marketing angle.  </li>
            <li> The hairdryer itself does the job well and dries the hair fast.</li>
            <li> It is also very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky with my blowdryers.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It has so much power that I don&#x27;t have to spend an hour drying my hair.</li>
            <li> but it all sounds very scientific</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t really dock them a star for that oversight, I guess.</li>
            <li> Outside of the sporty color that may seem more masculine or the fact that it&#x27;s inscribed with MANGROOMER on the side of it doesn&#x27;t change the functionality of the dryer itself.</li>
            <li> , quality high enough; design a nice extra</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hot when you set it on &#x27;High&#x27;, and cools quickly when you hold the blue button.</li>
            <li> BECAUSE IT REALLY IS HIGH POWERED AND FAST DRYING</li>
            <li> It has plenty of heat and power, runs fairly quiet and has all the usual features - high and low speed, warm and hot heat, a cool air burst button, and even ionic technology (for what that is worth), etc.  </li>
            <li> but if you want to dry / style your hair it should work just fine.</li>
            <li> I was able to get using the dryer on wet hair - and how fast this works, especially on the top heat setting, even for someone with really long hair.  </li>
            <li> Now can we go back to talking about how cool it looks?</li>
            <li> It has various heat, speed settings, a cool air button.</li>
            <li> The Ion button is located on the side of the barrel with a cool blue button indicator.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a plastic attachment to focus the air stream in a particular pattern.  </li>
            <li> It seems that is just an attempt at clever marketing</li>
            <li> Despite its otherwise respectable construction the lack of cord recoil makes it functionally inferior to my [[ASIN:B000R80ZTQ Infiniti 223XR Dryer]] and between the two of them I would never be able to tell you which hair dryer I had used in an extended blind study.  </li>
            <li> : First, the heat doesn&#x27;t seem as hot as with my girl&#x27;s hairdryer which makes sense for a man since the cuts are much different.</li>
            <li> This one is \\&quot;manly\\&quot; enough that you&#x27;ll look cool using it, and can leave it laying around without your date thinking you have a live in girlfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> THIS DRYER IS EXTREMELY HIGH POWERED.</li>
            <li> The red and black combo really looks nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice hairdryer and does the same job like hundreds of other hairdryers on the market.</li>
            <li> As someone who regards his hair as stuff that sits on top of my head and needs to be kept in some semblance of tidiness, a grooming product is of little interest to me.</li>
            <li> The Mangroomer is a large yet lightweight dryer that provides quiet and powerful hair drying action.</li>
            <li> things considered I don&#x27;t think this hair dryer is worth double that of alternatives</li>
            <li> I am a woman and my favorite color in the whole wide world is red</li>
            <li> I normally set the blow dryer to</li>
            <li> I did laugh at the target branding to the Male Population for this \\&quot;Mangroomer\\&quot;</li>
            <li> IT IS SOMEWHAT HEAVY, BUT I LOVE THE GRIP OF IT AND</li>
            <li> He thought the Mangroomer felt good and solid in his hands-light weight and dries his hair no different than any other hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are adequate, yet limited, heat and speed settings and it is powerful enough.  </li>
            <li> I like the Ion feature and the cool air boost button and the unique black and red colors.  </li>
            <li> I needed a new dryer, this would fill the bill.</li>
            <li> plus I needed a new one</li>
            <li> I was tempted by the Mangroomer because I needed a new hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It pushes a lot of air to dry quickly.  </li>
            <li> I guess they felt this was an under-served market even though the total available market (tam) for men is probably much smaller than the women&#x27;s market when considering that a)</li>
            <li> The thing does its job, but its not a professional as it seems, The air does become hot but the amount of air it blows out isn&#x27;t fast like those in the barbershops and salons.</li>
            <li> alot of men barely comb there hair so they certainly don&#x27;t blowdry it, and c)</li>
            <li> It has multiple heat settings, multiple speed settings, a cool blast button, an ionization button you can toggle on and off, and a removable end-cap you can use to focus the airflow.  </li>
            <li> The Mangroomer 1680XL-6 did a good job drying my long, thick hair, although not any faster than my old dryer.  </li>
            <li> At its core this is a decent general purpose hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> It drys my hair quickly unlike my other hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> but given that it does work I can only knock it so much.  </li>
            <li> Has all the features of a professional hair dryer.</li>
            <li> He has never used a hairdryer on his hair because he wears his hair close to the scalp or completely bald.</li>
            <li> B006BNFXHU Mangroomer 1680XL-6 Professional Ionic Hair Dryer for Men]]</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t personally use the add-on attachment, so I can&#x27;t comment on it, but it seems like it would be a useful tool for those who needed that specific form of styling.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no reason women can&#x27;t use this dryer as well, since Male and Female hair is pretty much the same.  </li>
            <li> There was a cold hot button, which is nice when you are done to &#x27;set&#x27; the style.</li>
            <li> Because of the little blue light that comes on when you turn on the Ion button?  </li>
            <li> yes, I suppose I should mention, it really does dry your hair.</li>
            <li> This apparently sets your hair after it has been styled?</li>
            <li> ... and if you&#x27;re not careful, she just might steal it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it isn&#x27;t too loud at the same time.</li>
            <li> dryer has completely stopped working for no reason after 5 months of daily use (it was not damaged in any way).  </li>
            <li> I contend that a real manly hair dryer would actually shoot fire into your hair to dry it.  </li>
            <li> In comparison to my 1 year old Remington hairdryer, the main handle is wider and less \\&quot;fitted\\&quot; to the hand.  </li>
            <li> Overall I found this dryer to be well built, powerful unit though a bit on the heavy side.  </li>
            <li> It always seems like they&#x27;re either too hot, not hot enough, or don&#x27;t give enough pressure to mold my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair and scalp have not undergone any change in recent weeks that I wouldn&#x27;t attribute to weather and the general rigors of being a dude with hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also really like using the ion button as it makes my hair less frizzy</li>
            <li> So I have very short hair, and as a rule, just let it dry naturally, however, my wife has LOTS of hair, and she loves this thing.  </li>
            <li> Most hairdryers are really hard on my hair, so I use them as little as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The wire end caps usually trap dust and lint and sometimes suck my long hair in if I&#x27;m not holding the dryer in just the right position.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The slightly higher than average price doesn&#x27;t seem to me to be excessive and the design makes it worth a few extra dollars.</li>
            <li> but as a person who dries her hair daily, I won&#x27;t be going back to the other hairdryer, even if this one is built bigger for a man.</li>
            <li> I only wash it once a week because it&#x27;s so darn dry</li>
            <li> But if I was a single guy with a red corvette and Fabio hair</li>
            <li> While not something I would consider myself an expert on, I can definitely discern wet hair from dry, and soft/smooth hair from coarse.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s colors might be manly (red, blue, and black), but the hair dryer works equally well for a man or a woman.  </li>
            <li> A quality product but a bit high on the price/value when considering that there are other serviceable hairdryers that cost less.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts but does the trick.</li>
            <li> He has longer hair (about 3 inches long), just over the ears.  </li>
            <li> I am going to keep this one for a long time,[[ASIN:</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The \\&quot;Mangroomer\\&quot; aspect is more of a marketing thing than any realistic specification for this hairdryer. My wife loves this hairdryer and uses it all the time too. It pumps out plenty of heat on the highest setting. There are numerous options for temperature settings. I&#x27;ve never needed it, but I tried the cold air blast feature. This apparently sets your hair after it has been styled? I don&#x27;t really understand that process, but if that&#x27;s important to you - the feature does just what it says. I found that the hairdryer volume while running is pretty acceptable (not sure if I&#x27;m alone on this, but I hate really loud hair dryers). The design is attractive and I guess a little manlier than the standard hairdryer? I don&#x27;t know, grasping for reasons why this is a \\&quot;mangroomer\\&quot; specifically, but yeah it looks pretty cool and not feminine. But I think you&#x27;d have to be pretty insecure to be weirded out using a feminine hairdryer anyway. I think the \\&quot;Negative Ion\\&quot; stuff is hogwash, but hey I&#x27;m not a hair scientist. Bottom line: this hairdryer makes wet hair dry.</li>
            <li> ... and if you&#x27;re not careful, she just might steal it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Mangroomer Hair Dryer for Men dries my shoulder-length hair faster than any other hair dryer I&#x27;ve every tried (less than five minutes) -- and it does it without over-drying my hair.  I didn&#x27;t need the attachment, so I can&#x27;t say how well it works, but this beauty of a hair dryer is now in *my* drawer.  Oh sure, my husband can use it whenever he wants, but this is now *mine*!</li>
            <li> This hairdryer works fine.  There are adequate, yet limited, heat and speed settings and it is powerful enough.  I love the long cord as that provides some flexibility.  I like the Ion feature and the cool air boost button and the unique black and red colors.  I think the heat and speed selection buttons seem a little flimsy and it remains to be seen how durable they will be.  It comes with a plastic attachment to focus the air stream in a particular pattern.  I agree with others reviews that there is nothing to warrant calling this a \\&quot;man&#x27;s hairdryer.\\&quot;  It seems that is just an attempt at clever marketing</li>
            <li> Bought it to replace my husband&#x27;s one that died. He loves this one. I have yet to see where he hides it!</li>
            <li> It works well, it&#x27;s a blowdryer.</li>
            <li> At its core this is a decent general purpose hair dryer.  While not something I would consider myself an expert on, I can definitely discern wet hair from dry, and soft/smooth hair from coarse.  To that end it does the job as you&#x27;d expect with a reasonable range of temperature and fan settings.  My gripe with this hair dryer comes from the lack of a cord recoil and a very questionable need for its purported negative ion technology.  Despite its otherwise respectable construction the lack of cord recoil makes it functionally inferior to my [[ASIN:B000R80ZTQ Infiniti 223XR Dryer]] and between the two of them I would never be able to tell you which hair dryer I had used in an extended blind study.  My hair and scalp have not undergone any change in recent weeks that I wouldn&#x27;t attribute to weather and the general rigors of being a dude with hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered I don&#x27;t think this hair dryer is worth double that of alternatives but given that it does work I can only knock it so much.  I would personally recommend shopping around but if you must be Mangroomed then this model shouldn&#x27;t disappoint much.</li>
            <li> I like this tool, but I really don&#x27;t get the \\&quot;Mangroomer\\&quot; marketing angle.  Is it a men&#x27;s hair dryer because of the color combination?  Because of the little blue light that comes on when you turn on the Ion button?  I don&#x27;t know, because none of those things make it a better tool for drying a man&#x27;s hair than a woman&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marketing angle aside, I liked the tool.  The surface material is great - it is cool to the touch even when it is on \\&quot;hot\\&quot; and my shoulder-length hair is frizz free after a Ion drying session.  I am a small woman so I often have difficulty with the handles on larger dryers, but this one is a great size and I don&#x27;t end up accidentally changing the settings.  It is lightweight enough that I don&#x27;t get worn out holding it up, especially since it takes a little less time to dry than with an ordinary dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All told, I found this to be a good tool and absolutely worth the price asked.</li>
            <li> I contend that a real manly hair dryer would actually shoot fire into your hair to dry it.  But, even though this hair dryer does not do that it is still a good product.  It has plenty of heat and power, runs fairly quiet and has all the usual features - high and low speed, warm and hot heat, a cool air burst button, and even ionic technology (for what that is worth), etc.  And it has an attachment for focusing the drying air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is marketed to men but in the end it is still just a hair dryer, red and black and sleek - so really not any less feminine than any other dryer.  It does not shoot manly flame or melt women who touch it but if you want to dry / style your hair it should work just fine.</li>
            <li> Confession time: I am not a man. I don&#x27;t even KNOW a man who uses a hairdryer, so I don&#x27;t know why this is \\&quot;for Men\\&quot;. That being said, this is the best hairdryer I have ever used. Don&#x27;t ask me to explain what that \\&quot;Ionic\\&quot; setting does---the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t even explain it to my satisfaction. But, somehow, it DOES WORK on my cobweb-fine, delicate, difficult, body-less, totally straight, almost-waist-length hair. I wear it long and braided so I can ignore it as much as possible, and so it doesn&#x27;t fly around all the time and get tangled in stuff or end up in people&#x27;s food.  I only wash it once a week because it&#x27;s so darn dry---it would probably all fall out if I washed it every day. I don&#x27;t perm, color, or otherwise mess with it because chemicals just destroy it. I&#x27;ve had the split ends of my braid knot up so badly in the wind that I&#x27;ve had to cut an inch or more off. Most hairdryers are really hard on my hair, so I use them as little as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the design of this hairdryer---it&#x27;s fairly light, comfortable to hold, and the attachment nozzle is nice for focusing the air where I want it. There&#x27;s nowhere my hair can fly into the works and get tangled. I use the ionic setting with the heat on high, and control the amount of hot air with the handy \\&quot;cool burst\\&quot; blue button that turns the heat off. My hair dries faster and untangles easier than it ever has in my life. Not only that, but it STAYS untangled all week. How is this possible? I don&#x27;t know. I DON&#x27;T CARE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought maybe I was imagining all this, so I asked my daughter-in-law to try it. She said, \\&quot;That was the best experience I&#x27;ve ever had with any hairdryer in my whole life.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t comment that this can&#x27;t possibly work and it&#x27;s all unscientific and that I&#x27;m making stuff up, as someone has on one of my other reviews. For me, this hairdryer makes a positive difference (pun intended) on my hair. Now I&#x27;m going to buy one for my daughter-in-law!</li>
            <li> Excellent buy! Has all the features of a professional hair dryer. Strong and sturdy. The only think I would relay to the marketing team is: &amp;#34;Why the black and red color? Why not Black and Navy?&amp;#34; Lol.</li>
            <li> Works great, even with traveling a lot it still isn&#x27;t too bulky. We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts but does the trick.</li>
            <li> Love this dryer. Low setting left hair dry but not static like some dryers. Higher settings may be better suited for long hair. Nice color combination.</li>
            <li> I like this product. As someone who regards his hair as stuff that sits on top of my head and needs to be kept in some semblance of tidiness, a grooming product is of little interest to me. I rarely use a hair dryer when I am away from home and it&#x27;s very much a matter of if it&#x27;s there I&#x27;ll use it; if it isn&#x27;t, then that&#x27;s what a towel is for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mangroomer is a pleasant surprise. The bright red and black design is appealing -- clean, bold and well-shaped. It looks good and feels good. I liked the solid construction and the firmness of the controls. Most of the features go way beyond my needs. I still don&#x27;t know what all the ionization stuff means; all I want to do is dry my hair quickly and have it feel good. The Mangroomer meets my basic needs in this regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The slightly higher than average price doesn&#x27;t seem to me to be excessive and the design makes it worth a few extra dollars. It is definitely more attractive than all the standard bathroom beige and blandness. I did not expect to actually enjoy a hair dryer. Summary: function good enough, quality high enough; design a nice extra</li>
            <li> This is a sturdy, high-quality hair dryer.  It has all the features that my own hair dryer comes with. It has multiple heat settings, multiple speed settings, a cool blast button, an ionization button you can toggle on and off, and a removable end-cap you can use to focus the airflow.  It has good speed, nice heat, and durability.  It doesn&#x27;t overheat and it dries hair very quickly, even longer hair like mine.  The only thing about this hair dryer that makes it a mangroomer is its appearance.  It looks like a power tool, so no man will be embarrassed to hang it in his bathroom where guests might see it.  In my home, my teens are using it.  It&#x27;s a great hair dryer, for men or women.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the hairdryer several times already and it seems to do the job well. The flow and heat settings allow just about any combination one would need. My wife and daughter have been using it as well despite the \\&quot;Mangroomer\\&quot; name and they seem to think it does a good job as well. :)  I&#x27;ve tried the ionic feature but could not see any effects. I could be that my hair is too short to have much static electricity issues or it&#x27;s just a marketing ploy.</li>
            <li> As my hair has gotten longer, I&#x27;ve suddenly seen the need for for a hairdryer.  I&#x27;m a Man, but let me just say \\&quot;Mangroomer\\&quot; is a brand.  There&#x27;s no reason women can&#x27;t use this dryer as well, since Male and Female hair is pretty much the same.  This unit has worked quite well for my purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-High power 1875W motor.&lt;br /&gt;-3 heat and 2 speed settings.  I tend to use the lowest heat and highest speed.&lt;br /&gt;-Cold air button to finish things off.&lt;br /&gt;-Comfy rubber grip.&lt;br /&gt;-Long cord.&lt;br /&gt;-It looks cool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Not really sure the magical ion feature actually does anything.&lt;br /&gt;-Annoying packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hairdryer does the job and looks cool doing it.  Recommended for men or women who want to be groomered.</li>
            <li> Overall I found this dryer to be well built, powerful unit though a bit on the heavy side.  Being a bit of a procrastinator when it comes tto getting haircuts, my hair tends to get fairly long between cuts and this dryer worked quickly and did a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it&#x27;s very similar to the unit my wife uses (and I use now and then) I&#x27;m sure it would be fine for her use as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what the point of the ion setting is all about (doesn&#x27;t seem to make any difference when I used it), but it&#x27;s there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I needed a new dryer, this would fill the bill.</li>
            <li> my girlfriend bought this for me because she was so tired of me using her hair dryer.  it works great and there is a cool ion switch and blue light on it.  nice to finally have a hair dryer built for guys.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this hair dryer and although it was designed for men, I use it on my own long hair and love it. It has a good weight and a comfortable handle which I quite appreciate (so that your hand doesn&#x27;t feel fatigued during use). I couldn&#x27;t figure out why a man would need a differently designed hair dryer but here is what I observed about the product: First, the heat doesn&#x27;t seem as hot as with my girl&#x27;s hairdryer which makes sense for a man since the cuts are much different. Second, it doesn&#x27;t blow to the point of feeling singed on my scalp but the power is still very good. Third and last, the metal grate (dust filter cap - I don&#x27;t know what the official name is) at the back of the hair dryer is way superior to any hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever had that has a wire end cap. The wire end caps usually trap dust and lint and sometimes suck my long hair in if I&#x27;m not holding the dryer in just the right position. This has a smooth, perforated end cap that appears resistant to those issues. Quite a nice product. Worthwhile.</li>
            <li> I love the look of this hair dryer, so I guess they knew what they were doing when they marketed it to men. I&#x27;m not a frequent hair dryer user, but it&#x27;s always good to have one around. This one is \\&quot;manly\\&quot; enough that you&#x27;ll look cool using it, and can leave it laying around without your date thinking you have a live in girlfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I just say that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, I suppose I should mention, it really does dry your hair. Now can we go back to talking about how cool it looks?</li>
            <li> I think they are calling it a Mangroomer since it looks really cool. The grip is nice and feels solid to hold. The hairdryer itself does the job well and dries the hair fast. It has various heat, speed settings, a cool air button. I loved the power on this and it isn&#x27;t too loud at the same time. You can also use the attachment but for me it worked well without it as well. The red and black combo really looks nice. I do recommend this hairdryer for the price and the power it delivers!</li>
            <li> I have to be completely honest in saying that, I don&#x27;t understand why this hairdryer is solely being marketed towards men. It&#x27;s a nice hairdryer and does the same job like hundreds of other hairdryers on the market. Outside of the sporty color that may seem more masculine or the fact that it&#x27;s inscribed with MANGROOMER on the side of it doesn&#x27;t change the functionality of the dryer itself. I would have to say that this is psychological advertising at its best! I am a woman and my favorite color in the whole wide world is red which attracted me to this hairdryer plus I needed a new one so I was very happy to get this one! My husband thinks the dryer is ugly. He has never used a hairdryer on his hair because he wears his hair close to the scalp or completely bald. I will admit that this is one of the best hairdryers that I have ever used. It is more powerful than the hairdryer that I just recently tossed into the trash. It drys my hair quickly unlike my other hairdryer.  It is also very sturdy.  I have accidentally dropped the hairdryer on several occasions and there is still not one dent, ding or scratch on the \\&quot;Mangroomer\\&quot; at all. It is definitely built like a man LOL!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get warm enough, or gets too hot...no in-between temp.</li>
            <li> The only reason I can see for this being called a \\&quot;Mangroomer\\&quot; is the colors obviously and the shorter cord than say regular hair dryers.  I nice strong motor and many settings to please nearly everyone.  I would recommend it to a friend, if men talked about such things . LOL</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never heard of a hair dryer just for men before, but we ignored that part anyway! This hairdryer works just fine for women too. I love the colors, black and red and the accessory attachment works great. I would definitely recommend this hair dryer for men or women. It worked well, looks nice in the bathroom and is a good value.</li>
            <li> I was extremely excited to try out this product and I have to say, I have been impressed with it. I normally set the blow dryer to it&#x27;s highest and warmest setting, and I am very pleased with the performance of this dryer in that regard. It is extremely powerful, but it doesn&#x27;t get too hot or overheat if I don&#x27;t move it constantly, a nice feature that many other dryers I&#x27;ve used don&#x27;t have. I don&#x27;t personally use the add-on attachment, so I can&#x27;t comment on it, but it seems like it would be a useful tool for those who needed that specific form of styling.</li>
            <li> It makes me laugh that this product is touted specifically for men.  It&#x27;s colors might be manly (red, blue, and black), but the hair dryer works equally well for a man or a woman.  My wife used it extensively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer itself is very functional and excellent.  I have had it for a couple months now, and it still works perfectly.  With heat settings and a nice grip as well.  The only reason I couldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because they say it&#x27;s for men.  Makes me laugh.  Still though, worth buying.</li>
            <li> I was tempted by the Mangroomer because I needed a new hair dryer. I didn&#x27;t buy the \\&quot;Man\\&quot; part of it and still don&#x27;t even after using this for 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it heats up and does it well. It has a nice, forceful wind that dried my hair in good time. There was a cold hot button, which is nice when you are done to &#x27;set&#x27; the style. The coating on the dryer is very nice, making it not so slick and easier to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it is nothing remarkable. I am unsure of the reasoning of the \\&quot;Ionic\\&quot; function. Having used both in dry and humid conditions, neither made a difference in the end.</li>
            <li> The Mangroomer arrived a few weeks ago and 3 of us decided to give it a try.  Here&#x27;s what we found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has very short hair and only uses a hairdryer on occasion.  He thought the Mangroomer felt good and solid in his hands-light weight and dries his hair no different than any other hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son used the Mangroomer for a few days.  He has longer hair (about 3 inches long), just over the ears.  He traded off between a smaller, cheaper hairdryer to the Mangroomer and thought it was less noisy than the cheaper, older model he is used too.  He thought the dryer was sleek looking, more manly than the \\&quot;girl\\&quot; hairdryer he has been using.  The different speeds and temperature settings were a plus considering he&#x27;s never had the choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly myself, I have shoulder length hair that has a course texture.  I use a hairdryer every day.  The Mangroomer looks and feels manly.  In comparison to my 1 year old Remington hairdryer, the main handle is wider and less \\&quot;fitted\\&quot; to the hand.  The buttons do not get in the way in comparison to other hairdryers that place them front and center.  The buttons on the Mangroomer are on the side, which never seem to get in the way.  The Ion button is located on the side of the barrel with a cool blue button indicator.  With or without the Ionic button I felt the dryer was the same.  A huge plus to this hairdryer is the speed in which it dries your hair.  It pushes a lot of air to dry quickly.  Another important thing to note is in comparison to my hairdryer the air does not get as hot, personally I think this is why the hair feels softer and more manageable than when I use the other hairdryer.  I actually noticed a difference in the softness of my hair.  It seems absurd to think a hairdryer can do this but as a person who dries her hair daily, I won&#x27;t be going back to the other hairdryer, even if this one is built bigger for a man.</li>
            <li> I did laugh at the target branding to the Male Population for this \\&quot;Mangroomer\\&quot; - I would like have been in the boardroom when that product concept was being reviewed.  I guess they felt this was an under-served market even though the total available market (tam) for men is probably much smaller than the women&#x27;s market when considering that a) there are alot more bald men than women, b) alot of men barely comb there hair so they certainly don&#x27;t blowdry it, and c) the wife&#x27;s hairdryer is already sitting there if needed.  But, if you want a manly hairdryer then I guess this fits the bill.  It does have manly color - evokes feelings of a red Corvette.  It is substantial weight and feels good in the hands.  It appears to have extra horsepower to blow hair in a manly fashion and it has lots of speeds to fiddle with.  In my usage I actually found it to be a good hairdryer - it does the job blowing my short hair around any which way I chose.  But, since my wife has a hairdryer to be honest I don&#x27;t quite have the bathroom real estate available to store two hairdryers.  Overall, I give it four stars.  A quality product but a bit high on the price/value when considering that there are other serviceable hairdryers that cost less.  Also in terms of necessity factor - for married guys not sure you want a second hairdryer in the bathroom.  But if I was a single guy with a red corvette and Fabio hair and I had to have a hairdryer in my bathroom then I guess this would be the one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky with my blowdryers. It always seems like they&#x27;re either too hot, not hot enough, or don&#x27;t give enough pressure to mold my hair. This blowdryer suffers from NONE of those problems. On top of the high quality drying it delivers, it is also very comfortable to hold. Most blowdryers have hard plastic handles that can slip easily (especially after a shower) but this one has a nice rubber texture to it. I&#x27;ve been using my Mangroomer for a couple of months now and I am thoroughly satisfied with it. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> So I have very short hair, and as a rule, just let it dry naturally, however, my wife has LOTS of hair, and she loves this thing.  Here is what she has to say:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The man groomer hair dryer is perfect for women too! It is the best I have used so far. It has so much power that I don&#x27;t have to spend an hour drying my hair. It may look manly but it doesn&#x27;t feel like it, being very light weight and comfortable to hold. I like that it has three heat settings. I also really like using the ion button as it makes my hair less frizzy looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer has completely stopped working for no reason after 5 months of daily use (it was not damaged in any way).  That level of quality is inexcusable.  Hair dryers should last for years.</li>
            <li> This is my first hair dryer,so have no experience but looks like a quality product.Four stars for only 30 days warranty...</li>
            <li> terrible product, just terrible. I only used it 3 times, it was smoking out, and stopped working all of a sudden.</li>
            <li> After 6 months of purchase, the hair dryer died on me. It&#x27;s just flashy marketing without any quality to it.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s the difference between a man&#x27;s hair dryer and a woman&#x27;s?  I have no idea.  I would think a man&#x27;s hair dryer would have 2 settings: \\&quot;Off\\&quot; and \\&quot;On\\&quot;.  This one has a combination of settings and I have no idea what their purposes are.  It will blow air of varying heats at varying speeds, if that appeals to you.  I tend to just use \\&quot;hot\\&quot; and \\&quot;high\\&quot;.  I&#x27;m not real sure about the ions but it all sounds very scientific so I just leave that on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months now and have had no problems with it.  It really does blast the heat, and air too, so drying is pretty quick.  The little detachable nozzle is nice too, as leaving it on focuses the air better, but I took it off once when I need to work some duckback oilskin treatment into my oilskin coat (no, really).  This calls for a more even application of heat so the ability to remove the nozzle was actually handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I can&#x27;t imagine how it could be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose it could dispense donuts but I can&#x27;t really dock them a star for that oversight, I guess.</li>
            <li> I was expecting just another typical hair dryer, but man this product rocks! it&#x27;s really powerful, so many speeds and temps for that styling look. I like the rubberized handle. With the air atttachment you have a huge blast of air.  I am going to keep this one for a long time,[[ASIN:B006BNFXHU Mangroomer 1680XL-6 Professional Ionic Hair Dryer for Men]]</li>
            <li> First, I am a woman and I got this hairdryer for my own use (my hubby is bald).  The Mangroomer 1680XL-6 did a good job drying my long, thick hair, although not any faster than my old dryer.  Things I like about it:  adjustable heat settings and the attachable diffuser.  It is bigger and slightly heavier than my old drier, but has a good rubber grip, quiet motor, and a fun bright color scheme. I tried it with the ionic setting on and with it off and found no difference in the look of my hair with either.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care about any attachments that come with a blow dryer and toss them on arrival.  Manly Men, like me for example, don&#x27;t use blow dryers because that would be vain and, you know, unmanly.  UNLESS maybe the man lives in a really cold climate, let&#x27;s say Chicago for no reason in particular, and would risk forming an ice hair helmet if he left the house with it still damp.  In that scenario I think it&#x27;s probably okay so long as he uses a blow dryer that has the word \\&quot;MAN\\&quot; in its name and doesn&#x27;t talk about it, ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it four out of five stars, because it&#x27;s okay for a guy to like a blow dryer, but \\&quot;unmanly\\&quot; for a guy to \\&quot;love\\&quot; one.ive it four out of five stars, because it&#x27;s okay for a guy to like a blow dryer, but probably not only unnatural, but more importantly, \\&quot;unmanly\\&quot; for a guy to \\&quot;love\\&quot; his blow dryer.</li>
            <li> The thing does its job, but its not a professional as it seems, The air does become hot but the amount of air it blows out isn&#x27;t fast like those in the barbershops and salons. Good for now though.</li>
            <li> While this hair dryer is marketing to the guys, this is a truly unisex hair styling tool.  I found the settings easy to adjust and was pleased with the extra volume I was able to get using the dryer on wet hair - and how fast this works, especially on the top heat setting, even for someone with really long hair.  The ionic technology is also used on my flat iron, which is a nice plus to keep frizz at bay.  I found the weight of the dryer to be light enough that it is comfortable to hold for a while, a good benefit for those of us with long hair.</li>
            <li> Good product and quite!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer works well.  I thought it was a little on the expensive--but it seems like it is well made.</li>
            <li> What more can you say about a hairdryer? It&#x27;s hot when you set it on &#x27;High&#x27;, and cools quickly when you hold the blue button. It always turns on when you need it to. That&#x27;s about all I need for a hair dryer, and this does it.</li>
            <li> I got this hair dryer b/c I wanted a no-frills, sturdy hairdryer, and that&#x27;s exactly what I got. It performs exceptionally well and I have even dried - wait for it - CHICKENS w/ it outside. It&#x27;s that sturdy. :) B/c I&#x27;m a woman I&#x27;m not using the little blue button; regardless, this is an awesome piece of equipment.</li>
            <li> The Mangroomer is a large yet lightweight dryer that provides quiet and powerful hair drying action. Even my wife&#x27;s thick and long hair is dried within minutes. The size of the hair dryer means it is not meant for travel, but rather one that should stay at home. The cord length is appropriate and does not interfere with my morning routine of getting ready and singing along to Katy Perry in the mirror and imagining myself at Madison Square Garden.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this product. It has the functions I need and nothing more. Rated three stars because I dropped the funnel attachment once and it cracked off the hook so had to toss it. Besides that, it serves like any other hair dryer</li>
            <li> THIS DRYER IS EXTREMELY HIGH POWERED. IT IS SOMEWHAT HEAVY, BUT I LOVE THE GRIP OF IT AND ITS PROBABLY SLIGHTLY HEAVY BECAUSE IT REALLY IS HIGH POWERED AND FAST DRYING</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer.  Fast and hot.  Good quality product.</li>
            <li> works great, looks cool</li>
