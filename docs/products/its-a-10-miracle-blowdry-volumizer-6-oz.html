            <li>you want more volume for your hair.  </li>
            <li>I did not get the volume I had hoped for and have much better luck with mousse.</li>
            <li>My husband and mother both love this.  </li>
            <li>so i didn&#x27;t think i would see much more volume.</li>
            <li>I do love it after I wash my hair.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone that needs more volume.  </li>

            <li>I love this product.</li>

            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;just looks like I have so much more hair..</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair frizzy as many products do.</li>

            <li>Love the fragrance</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Ok for me, maybe not for others.</li>
            <li>More volume, bounce--and</li>

            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>best for my fine super straight hair!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>My hairdresser used this on me for the first time, and I loved the hold and the texture it creates.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy, it smells great, and it gives my hair great body.</li>
            <li>Perfect for damp hair or dry.</li>
            <li>Since my hair is fine, this product gives my hair more volume in addition,  I use this as a hair spray and it does hold the hair, prevents the humidity from making it frizzy.  </li>
            <li>It gives my fine hair some lift and body at the roots, where I mostly need it.</li>
            <li>Love it for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, it gives great volume without stickiness or apparent build-up.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a 10 is always good, but this really works.  </li>
            <li>But smells good and keeps hair straight</li>
            <li>say enough about how great this works for fine hair!  </li>
            <li>I was so excited about this product as I love</li>
            <li>Easy to work with.  </li>
            <li>Adds body and makes it easy to style.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I found it for this price online, $13/free ship, because it was $6 more in my local salon.</li>
            <li>The volume lasts throught the humidity and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to work with.</li>
            <li>i have a fine hair and this makes my hair look bit fluffy.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a fine mist</li>
            <li>It seemed fine.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, layered hair.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone with fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and the spray gives me a lot of fullness that I don&#x27;t get without using it.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my baby fine hair in place and protects against split and sun damage.</li>
            <li>She has medium length, baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair but a lot of it</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>Works well on fine hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it works great as a volumizer, as volumizers basically hold the same as a mild hairspray.</li>
            <li>Lightly spray if you have fine hair,&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Great stuff for baby fine short hair.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of very fine hair that can get flat without a good blowout.</li>
            <li>I was on vacation without it, and realized what a huge difference it made in my styling routine.</li>
            <li>Love this product for volume and fresh fragrence</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair smooth and shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li>no matter how lightly I use it.</li>
            <li>A LIGHT HAIRSPRAY</li>
            <li>And this stuff isn&#x27;t cheap, either.  </li>
            <li>I find the miracle leave-in conditioner a lot more useful.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic volumizer.</li>
            <li>Use with the lite leave in conditioning after shampooing with the light shampoo -&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>I gave this product a 2 because it smells really good and is  good finishing spray with firm hold.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of very fine hair and this product really gives it some OMPH!</li>
            <li>MUCH EASIER!!!  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>Purchased this for my sister who has super fine hair.</li>
            <li>It is light but sweet smelling.</li>
            <li>I originally found out about this product through my hairdresser.</li>
            <li>Worth it!</li>
            <li>Love it so much!</li>
            <li>Thanks guys! :)</li>
            <li>Well worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It really helps my fine hair style better.</li>
            <li>It also has a clean, salon smell.</li>
            <li>my natural hair is pretty fine but wavy, and without some help, that isn&#x27;t a good combo.</li>
            <li>can not say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a hair spray user, or really that into many products.</li>
            <li>but I love the smell so much I&#x27;ll continue using</li>
            <li>I had to throw mine away after giving a good try over several days.  </li>
            <li>Another good point about it is that it last all day!  </li>
            <li>Really plumps up the hair and makes it fuller and more easier to style.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who wants more volume.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know why, just smells clean and fresh to me.</li>
            <li>My grocery store stopped carrying this product so luckily Amazon carried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this product as a mild hairspray.</li>
            <li>At the time I was using a pretty cheap shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>Great product that does not weigh your hair down, while giving body.</li>
            <li>Give great body with out weighing down you hair.  </li>
            <li>This is a good volumizer and does not make your hair dry.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely a 10!!</li>
            <li>but I stack it in the back, love it!</li>
            <li>I have SUPER thin hair and this stuff is AWESOME.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine but not thin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great if you just need a little lift (or fragrance) in-between stylings.</li>
            <li>I am on my 3rd bottle and it&#x27;s been so great for my thinning, fine, lifeless colored (blonde) hair.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really need volume, but this stuff makes my curls looks fabulous.  </li>
            <li>The search continues for an effective product that makes my hair bigger but not like a haystack.</li>
            <li>This goes into the garage sale pile, as it isn&#x27;t worth the bother of returning.</li>
            <li>sections are poinked up (maybe good for Halloween, but not much else).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft, and has SOOO much more volume.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and most volumizers end up making my hair feel sticky, weighted down and tangled.  </li>
            <li>Hair was full and soft, and it was easy to comb through to touch up.  </li>
            <li>It gives it the right amount of volume without a build up feel on my hair.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair but very fine; on good hair days; my hair looks good; on bad hair days, high humidity,</li>
            <li>and I usually do not feel this strongly about a product.  </li>
            <li>I used it on the roots while wet and then blow dry and great volume which lasts all day!</li>
            <li>Great for limp hair!</li>
            <li>It smells great, but I&#x27;m not sure aerosols should be shipped via USPS</li>
            <li>Works great on my fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>Great for volume for thin fine hair and has sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It helps fine straight hair and really does give it volume.</li>
            <li>I can certainly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>This product has been the solution to volume for my super straight hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave In Treatment, blow dry my hair upside down, and have a perfect hair day.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, flat hair.  </li>
            <li>This volumizer works well for my hair, which is fine and soft.  </li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair so most products seem to weigh it down.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>This stuff does EXACTLY what it promises.  </li>
            <li>Volume for sure, I don&#x27;t use daily</li>
            <li>and this is the first volumizer that doesn&#x27;t make my oily.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend it!!</li>
            <li>I really like it a lot!</li>
            <li>I tried this for the first time this morning and WOAH.</li>
            <li>My hair has so much extra body I am falling in love with it all over again.</li>
            <li>Got my first can from Target then couldn&#x27;t find it.  </li>
            <li>I use a gel first, then lift sections of hair and spray the roots with this stuff before blow-drying.  </li>
            <li>This spray is pretty intense!</li>
            <li>really works!</li>
            <li>I discovered this product when my hair dresser used it the first time on my hair.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I have used this product prior, but purchased it in a salon and paid more.  </li>
            <li>The item arrived quickly, and I was glad because my other can of spray was almost out.</li>
            <li>You could take any hairspray and spray it on your hair before blowdrying and get just as good results if not better.  </li>
            <li>Gives great volume to my flat hair and doesn&#x27;t smell like chemicals like some other boosting products do.</li>
            <li>It makes me hair super soft and manageable as well as holds my style all day.</li>
            <li>It really gives my roots so much more lift when I blow dry my hair.  </li>
            <li>and this really is good for both volume and a final hold (if you allow it to dry).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 years now and it never fails to live up to it&#x27;s promise...a miracle!  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical but with all the other great reviews I decided to try it and am very glad I did.  </li>
            <li>This is NOT a miracle, but I absolutely see results.  </li>
            <li>This really does give my hair volume.  </li>
            <li>When I spray this and then blow-dried, the whole house stank like hair spray.</li>
            <li>The whole product line works for me.</li>
            <li>but once you&#x27;re done drying it is much lighter.  </li>
            <li>and it really adds volume.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper than salon and even stores.</li>
            <li>Then it&#x27;s ready to be styled with or without the hair dryer.</li>
            <li>WILL USE IT AS A FINAL LIGHT SPRAY TOO.</li>
            <li>Also very affordable.</li>
            <li>thanks.  </li>
            <li>I can get texas sized hair if I really want.</li>
            <li>It really does work</li>
            <li>My hair always felt &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34;; like I&#x27;d used a whole can of hairspray on it at once.  </li>
            <li>really does work.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really explain</li>
            <li>I expected better considering what I paid.</li>
            <li>My hair dresser noticed a real difference.</li>
            <li>But after using this, it adds so much volume that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This product works very well.</li>
            <li>Really does what it says.</li>
            <li>and I have SO much body.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Blow Dry VOlumizer adds a great deal of volume to my fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li>Used on damp hair, it really does a great job holding hair if you round brush dry it.  </li>
            <li>I can use it on damp or dry hair and it seems to work the same, which is nice when I&#x27;m in a hurry or just need a pick me up.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for a great product for thin hair--and WOW!</li>
            <li>i usually spray on damp hair, put my hair up in a bun for the night, and finish blow drying in the morning, and then my hair is kind of a poof ball but also wavy/curly.  </li>
            <li>Makes my very fine, flat hair feel like I actually have a head of hair!  </li>
            <li>more manageable  and gives it a shiny bounce without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it if you have fine, limp hair.  </li>
            <li>It works better than any other I have tried!</li>
            <li>got good volume, left my hair a little sticky.</li>
            <li>The scent is a little strong at first</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>This volumizer smells GREAT and gives my thin, straight hair the lift I need in the back.</li>
            <li>Helps add volume without weighing it down, plus it&#x27;s easy to use and not sticky.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t weigh down fine hair and doesn&#x27;t leave a build up.</li>
            <li>Yes, you do need to shampoo more frequently than without, but at least it does not go sour smelling on your hair after 24 hours like most do.</li>
            <li>: The first time I used this the results were as stated above.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I don&#x27;t even have to flat iron my hair because this stuff can hold it straight after blow drying really well</li>
            <li>IT makes the texture of my hair super sticky and rough.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair that needs a little volume.</li>
            <li>They both have thin hair and it does something that they say is magical!  </li>
            <li>Gives texture and fullness to my fine limp hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine limp hair.</li>
            <li>It gives volume to my hair and renews natural curl as hair dries naturally or using a hair dryer</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice any extra fullness really either.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>Gives extra volume which I really need.</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>Be carful not to spray too much near your roots or it can feel greasy.</li>
            <li>Just some light bursts at the roots and a few in the rest of my hair, then combed through, results in some voluminous hair.</li>
            <li>I love this brand, and I decided that I&#x27;d give this a product a go because I&#x27;m a sucker for volume.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel thick, and it holds style so much better.</li>
            <li>Lots of body have to be careful to not use too much!</li>
            <li>I have fine limp hair and it helps put volume back in it!</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin hair</li>
            <li>Adds a little more volume but not much.</li>
            <li>I used to really like this miracle blow dry volumizer, but maybe my hair needs have changed over time.</li>
            <li>Okay, so i already have big, thick hair</li>
            <li>This product is weightless and leaves my hair feeling very soft, but also somehow manages to give it lots of extra volume.  </li>
            <li>She highly recommends this product for people  with  fine, thin hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this for anyone who has fine hair, or thin hair.</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this product, especially after reading reviews.</li>
            <li>Every day since then, it has barely made a difference.  </li>
            <li>I have course curly hair and this product makes my hair soft enough but still lets it curl.  </li>
            <li>This product only &amp;#34;volumized&amp;#34; the section of hair where it was directly sprayed (even though I then combed the product through my hair before blow drying).  </li>
            <li>It works so well that I have to be careful about using too much of it.</li>
            <li>I have to say I LOVED the smell but threw it away since it was useless!</li>
            <li>I feel like the other, positive reviewers were using an entirely different product from what I received.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels very bouncy as though a professional dried and styled it for me.  </li>
            <li>By the end of the day today my fine hair was dull, flat, and lifeless!  </li>
            <li>I am sick to death of reading great reviews, buying a product only to find</li>
            <li>a few minutes and your hair has so much body!  </li>
            <li>The trick is to find the right amount of product for your hair so that it&#x27;s not too much (sticky) or too little (limp).  </li>
            <li>my hair usually falls flat by mid day, and the day I used this, it looked shiney AND full of volume.  </li>
            <li>I guess it took me a long time to realize this stuff DOES give a lot of volume, and also brings out my natural curl oddly enough.</li>
            <li>It does work well to add volume to my thin hair, however the scent is too strong for me.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair-</li>
            <li>Maybe it works for some people; however, for my fine thin hair, this product was horrid.  </li>
            <li>Hair looks healthier - I have processed hair that is thin and fine.</li>
            <li>for fine or thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;Prices from Amazon are lower than stores.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE</li>

            <li> but it smells good too.</li>

            <li> I think which is good.</li>
            <li> that is a good thing though, because i run a curling iron through it to take advantage of the curl or let it settle a bit</li>

            <li> you want more volume for your hair.  </li>
            <li> I did not get the volume I had hoped for and have much better luck with mousse.</li>
            <li> My husband and mother both love this.  </li>
            <li> so i didn&#x27;t think i would see much more volume.</li>
            <li> I do love it after I wash my hair.  </li>

            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Ok for me, maybe not for others.</li>
            <li> More volume, bounce--and</li>
            <li> the It&#x27;s a 10 product line more.</li>
            <li> I love the product.</li>
            <li> best for my fine super straight hair!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love it...</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this on me for the first time, and I loved the hold and the texture it creates.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy, it smells great, and it gives my hair great body.</li>
            <li> Perfect for damp hair or dry.</li>
            <li> Since my hair is fine, this product gives my hair more volume in addition,  I use this as a hair spray and it does hold the hair, prevents the humidity from making it frizzy.  </li>
            <li> It gives my fine hair some lift and body at the roots, where I mostly need it.</li>
            <li> Love it for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I love this product, it gives great volume without stickiness or apparent build-up.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 is always good, but this really works.  </li>
            <li> But smells good and keeps hair straight</li>
            <li> say enough about how great this works for fine hair!  </li>
            <li> I was so excited about this product as I love</li>
            <li> Easy to work with.  </li>
            <li> Adds body and makes it easy to style.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I found it for this price online, $13/free ship, because it was $6 more in my local salon.</li>
            <li> The volume lasts throught the humidity and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to work with.</li>
            <li> i have a fine hair and this makes my hair look bit fluffy.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a fine mist</li>
            <li> It seemed fine.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, layered hair.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and the spray gives me a lot of fullness that I don&#x27;t get without using it.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my baby fine hair in place and protects against split and sun damage.</li>
            <li> She has medium length, baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair but a lot of it</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> Works well on fine hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it works great as a volumizer, as volumizers basically hold the same as a mild hairspray.</li>
            <li> Lightly spray if you have fine hair,&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Great stuff for baby fine short hair.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of very fine hair that can get flat without a good blowout.</li>
            <li> I was on vacation without it, and realized what a huge difference it made in my styling routine.</li>
            <li> Love this product for volume and fresh fragrence</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair smooth and shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li> no matter how lightly I use it.</li>
            <li> A LIGHT HAIRSPRAY</li>
            <li> And this stuff isn&#x27;t cheap, either.  </li>
            <li> I find the miracle leave-in conditioner a lot more useful.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic volumizer.</li>
            <li> Use with the lite leave in conditioning after shampooing with the light shampoo -&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> I gave this product a 2 because it smells really good and is  good finishing spray with firm hold.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of very fine hair and this product really gives it some OMPH!</li>
            <li> MUCH EASIER!!!  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my sister who has super fine hair.</li>
            <li> It is light but sweet smelling.</li>
            <li> I originally found out about this product through my hairdresser.</li>
            <li> Worth it!</li>
            <li> Love it so much!</li>
            <li> Thanks guys! :)</li>
            <li> Well worth every penny!</li>
            <li> It really helps my fine hair style better.</li>
            <li> It also has a clean, salon smell.</li>
            <li> my natural hair is pretty fine but wavy, and without some help, that isn&#x27;t a good combo.</li>
            <li> can not say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a hair spray user, or really that into many products.</li>
            <li> but I love the smell so much I&#x27;ll continue using</li>
            <li> I had to throw mine away after giving a good try over several days.  </li>
            <li> Another good point about it is that it last all day!  </li>
            <li> Really plumps up the hair and makes it fuller and more easier to style.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who wants more volume.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know why, just smells clean and fresh to me.</li>
            <li> My grocery store stopped carrying this product so luckily Amazon carried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this product as a mild hairspray.</li>
            <li> At the time I was using a pretty cheap shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> Great product that does not weigh your hair down, while giving body.</li>
            <li> Give great body with out weighing down you hair.  </li>
            <li> This is a good volumizer and does not make your hair dry.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely a 10!!</li>
            <li> but I stack it in the back, love it!</li>
            <li> I have SUPER thin hair and this stuff is AWESOME.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine but not thin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great if you just need a little lift (or fragrance) in-between stylings.</li>
            <li> I am on my 3rd bottle and it&#x27;s been so great for my thinning, fine, lifeless colored (blonde) hair.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really need volume, but this stuff makes my curls looks fabulous.  </li>
            <li> The search continues for an effective product that makes my hair bigger but not like a haystack.</li>
            <li> This goes into the garage sale pile, as it isn&#x27;t worth the bother of returning.</li>
            <li> sections are poinked up (maybe good for Halloween, but not much else).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft, and has SOOO much more volume.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and most volumizers end up making my hair feel sticky, weighted down and tangled.  </li>
            <li> Hair was full and soft, and it was easy to comb through to touch up.  </li>
            <li> It gives it the right amount of volume without a build up feel on my hair.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair but very fine; on good hair days; my hair looks good; on bad hair days, high humidity,</li>
            <li> and I usually do not feel this strongly about a product.  </li>
            <li> I used it on the roots while wet and then blow dry and great volume which lasts all day!</li>
            <li> Great for limp hair!</li>
            <li> It smells great, but I&#x27;m not sure aerosols should be shipped via USPS</li>
            <li> Works great on my fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> Great for volume for thin fine hair and has sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It helps fine straight hair and really does give it volume.</li>
            <li> I can certainly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This product has been the solution to volume for my super straight hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave In Treatment, blow dry my hair upside down, and have a perfect hair day.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, flat hair.  </li>
            <li> This volumizer works well for my hair, which is fine and soft.  </li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair so most products seem to weigh it down.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> This stuff does EXACTLY what it promises.  </li>
            <li> Volume for sure, I don&#x27;t use daily</li>
            <li> and this is the first volumizer that doesn&#x27;t make my oily.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I really like it a lot!</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time this morning and WOAH.</li>
            <li> My hair has so much extra body I am falling in love with it all over again.</li>
            <li> Got my first can from Target then couldn&#x27;t find it.  </li>
            <li> I use a gel first, then lift sections of hair and spray the roots with this stuff before blow-drying.  </li>
            <li> This spray is pretty intense!</li>
            <li> really works!</li>
            <li> I discovered this product when my hair dresser used it the first time on my hair.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I have used this product prior, but purchased it in a salon and paid more.  </li>
            <li> The item arrived quickly, and I was glad because my other can of spray was almost out.</li>
            <li> You could take any hairspray and spray it on your hair before blowdrying and get just as good results if not better.  </li>
            <li> Gives great volume to my flat hair and doesn&#x27;t smell like chemicals like some other boosting products do.</li>
            <li> It makes me hair super soft and manageable as well as holds my style all day.</li>
            <li> It really gives my roots so much more lift when I blow dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> and this really is good for both volume and a final hold (if you allow it to dry).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 years now and it never fails to live up to it&#x27;s promise...a miracle!  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical but with all the other great reviews I decided to try it and am very glad I did.  </li>
            <li> This is NOT a miracle, but I absolutely see results.  </li>
            <li> This really does give my hair volume.  </li>
            <li> When I spray this and then blow-dried, the whole house stank like hair spray.</li>
            <li> The whole product line works for me.</li>
            <li> but once you&#x27;re done drying it is much lighter.  </li>
            <li> and it really adds volume.  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper than salon and even stores.</li>
            <li> Then it&#x27;s ready to be styled with or without the hair dryer.</li>
            <li> WILL USE IT AS A FINAL LIGHT SPRAY TOO.</li>
            <li> Also very affordable.</li>
            <li> thanks.  </li>
            <li> I can get texas sized hair if I really want.</li>
            <li> It really does work</li>
            <li> My hair always felt &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34;; like I&#x27;d used a whole can of hairspray on it at once.  </li>
            <li> really does work.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really explain</li>
            <li> I expected better considering what I paid.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser noticed a real difference.</li>
            <li> But after using this, it adds so much volume that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This product works very well.</li>
            <li> Really does what it says.</li>
            <li> and I have SO much body.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Blow Dry VOlumizer adds a great deal of volume to my fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li> Used on damp hair, it really does a great job holding hair if you round brush dry it.  </li>
            <li> I can use it on damp or dry hair and it seems to work the same, which is nice when I&#x27;m in a hurry or just need a pick me up.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for a great product for thin hair--and WOW!</li>
            <li> i usually spray on damp hair, put my hair up in a bun for the night, and finish blow drying in the morning, and then my hair is kind of a poof ball but also wavy/curly.  </li>
            <li> Makes my very fine, flat hair feel like I actually have a head of hair!  </li>
            <li> more manageable  and gives it a shiny bounce without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it if you have fine, limp hair.  </li>
            <li> It works better than any other I have tried!</li>
            <li> got good volume, left my hair a little sticky.</li>
            <li> The scent is a little strong at first</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> This volumizer smells GREAT and gives my thin, straight hair the lift I need in the back.</li>
            <li> Helps add volume without weighing it down, plus it&#x27;s easy to use and not sticky.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh down fine hair and doesn&#x27;t leave a build up.</li>
            <li> Yes, you do need to shampoo more frequently than without, but at least it does not go sour smelling on your hair after 24 hours like most do.</li>
            <li> : The first time I used this the results were as stated above.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I don&#x27;t even have to flat iron my hair because this stuff can hold it straight after blow drying really well</li>
            <li> IT makes the texture of my hair super sticky and rough.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair that needs a little volume.</li>
            <li> They both have thin hair and it does something that they say is magical!  </li>
            <li> Gives texture and fullness to my fine limp hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine limp hair.</li>
            <li> It gives volume to my hair and renews natural curl as hair dries naturally or using a hair dryer</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any extra fullness really either.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> Gives extra volume which I really need.</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> Be carful not to spray too much near your roots or it can feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Just some light bursts at the roots and a few in the rest of my hair, then combed through, results in some voluminous hair.</li>
            <li> I love this brand, and I decided that I&#x27;d give this a product a go because I&#x27;m a sucker for volume.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel thick, and it holds style so much better.</li>
            <li> Lots of body have to be careful to not use too much!</li>
            <li> I have fine limp hair and it helps put volume back in it!</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair</li>
            <li> Adds a little more volume but not much.</li>
            <li> I used to really like this miracle blow dry volumizer, but maybe my hair needs have changed over time.</li>
            <li> Okay, so i already have big, thick hair</li>
            <li> This product is weightless and leaves my hair feeling very soft, but also somehow manages to give it lots of extra volume.  </li>
            <li> She highly recommends this product for people  with  fine, thin hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this for anyone who has fine hair, or thin hair.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product, especially after reading reviews.</li>
            <li> Every day since then, it has barely made a difference.  </li>
            <li> I have course curly hair and this product makes my hair soft enough but still lets it curl.  </li>
            <li> This product only &amp;#34;volumized&amp;#34; the section of hair where it was directly sprayed (even though I then combed the product through my hair before blow drying).  </li>
            <li> It works so well that I have to be careful about using too much of it.</li>
            <li> I have to say I LOVED the smell but threw it away since it was useless!</li>
            <li> I feel like the other, positive reviewers were using an entirely different product from what I received.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels very bouncy as though a professional dried and styled it for me.  </li>
            <li> By the end of the day today my fine hair was dull, flat, and lifeless!  </li>
            <li> I am sick to death of reading great reviews, buying a product only to find</li>
            <li> a few minutes and your hair has so much body!  </li>
            <li> The trick is to find the right amount of product for your hair so that it&#x27;s not too much (sticky) or too little (limp).  </li>
            <li> my hair usually falls flat by mid day, and the day I used this, it looked shiney AND full of volume.  </li>
            <li> I guess it took me a long time to realize this stuff DOES give a lot of volume, and also brings out my natural curl oddly enough.</li>
            <li> It does work well to add volume to my thin hair, however the scent is too strong for me.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair-</li>
            <li> Maybe it works for some people; however, for my fine thin hair, this product was horrid.  </li>
            <li> Hair looks healthier - I have processed hair that is thin and fine.</li>
            <li> for fine or thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;Prices from Amazon are lower than stores.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE</li>
            <li> I have very thin, fine hair that typically gets oily when I use volumizer, but this stuff doesn&#x27;t get goopy or leave much of a residue!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to anyone who needs a little boost.</li>
            <li> i spray just a small amount on my roots before rolling in a large curler.</li>
            <li> The only volumizing spray I&#x27;ve tried that actually works on my fine, thin hair!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it made my hair flat and by the end of the day it looked dull.  </li>
            <li> Not sure ice really sane a difference in volume,</li>
            <li> so it should last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I also spray it on my brush during the day and it adds some thickness to my hair and keeps it from getting  flat and flyaway.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27; s also long lasting.</li>
            <li> Imagine a hair style where sections are flat and</li>
            <li> I put 4 stars only because it seemed to take a long time to receive</li>
            <li> I have baby-fine, flat hair and this stuff</li>
            <li> My fine hair is limp no more!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work so well on dry hair as a styling mist, but maybe I am not using it properly.  </li>
            <li> The smell was very strong, unpleasant and overpowering to me.  </li>
            <li> You can work with hair after it&#x27;s sprayed on dry hair only after it&#x27;s dry (which doesn&#x27;t take long).  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s always going flat after I blow dry it and style it.</li>
            <li> Very sticky and hard to brush with blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of products from cheap to expensive.</li>
            <li> Hair is not soft after use.</li>
            <li> Obviously, I was curious why the difference.  </li>
            <li> It was a complete waste of money for me</li>
            <li> It volumizes all day long, your hair is silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, fine hair and this product made a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the products/done all the tricks, nothing works for much longer than a few hours (or less, depending on the weather).  </li>
            <li> This had nothing to do with any difference in my hair other than using this product that came through two different sellers.  </li>
            <li> Works all day long!</li>
            <li> I use it before I blow dry my hair and also as hair spray.  </li>
            <li> Makes hair dry and unmanageable indoors or outdoors.</li>
            <li> I can blow dry my hair with lots of volume and shine or spray it on my hair and set it with rollers.</li>
            <li> I just spray it on my damp hair, blow dry and the heat style.  </li>
            <li> It even works on dry hair for touch ups.</li>
            <li> Just spray on hair before blow drying OR use on dry hair and set on rollers&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li> I was told by my daughter to try this for my thin, white straight hair.  </li>
            <li> Very much do not like this product at all and not happy that I can&#x27;t get it returned.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s one of the only products that actually DOES add body whereas a lot of other products that claim to add body just weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> I found it brought life to my limp and very thin hair and gave me the ability to style into some cute styles.</li>
            <li> Spray on after towel drying hair then blow dry!</li>
            <li> I spray it on wet hair before I comb out and blow dry</li>
            <li> My hair is very thin and it made it feel oily too quickly.  </li>
            <li> Even when paired with other products from the same line, this volumizer makes my hair really dry and even a little sticky.</li>
            <li> but it does not seem to dry my hair out like other volumizer sprays.</li>
            <li> Definitely adds the volume without weighing my hair down!</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and the bottle still last awhile!</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t produce the volume and height I expected, but then again nothing seems to work well in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful using a styling or flatening iron after application, tends to cause breakage if heat is applied after application.&lt;br /&gt;Oh</li>
            <li> I use it on my hair wet and also hold after styling.</li>
            <li> make &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; hair become full-bodied.  </li>
            <li> It offers just enough texture to make me forget my hair is so thin.  </li>
            <li> , I look like i have a flat head with little hair.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, my son&#x27;s girlfriend loves this product.  </li>
            <li> There is no sticky build-up, as has sometimes been the case with other volumizers.  </li>
            <li> Try it I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t be disappointed,</li>
            <li> /&gt;with other products again.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very thin and this product makes my hair look twice as thick and easy to manage, plus your hair does not feel sticky.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and heavy, so anything that can give me that lift I really like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked for a long time for a product that wouldn&#x27;t make my hair stiff or crunchy</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Blow Dry Volumizer&amp;#34; is highly overrated and expensive.</li>
            <li> Since a little goes a long way, I now have a few years&#x27; supply.</li>
            <li> Not worth trying.</li>
            <li> and I find my hair to be too sticky, unnatural and weighed down,</li>
            <li> Gives lots of body but does not weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really sticky or stiff...</li>
            <li> I was vey disappointed in this product, especially with all the other positive reviews of it.  </li>
            <li> I instantly noticed the volume in my thick heavy hair which used to be so weighed down and looked plastered to my head.  </li>
            <li> And this does not make your hair stiff, sticky or weigh it down at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey</li>
            <li> I do not have to use a lot of this product as I have had to in the past with other products.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really add volume and left my hair feeling sticky and cruddy and looking dry.  </li>
            <li> I use the blow dryer for a few minutes and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> Will be using this everyday now.</li>
            <li> This gave my thin hair extra oooomph.  </li>
            <li> I bought this item because my hair is so limp...</li>
            <li> Have been using it for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> A few squirts of this when I&#x27;m blow drying my hair</li>
            <li> and i have volume for a few days.  </li>
            <li> Not at all heavy.  </li>
            <li> not incredible but gives extra lift without being sticky or weighing hair down.  </li>
            <li> It did not make my fuller, did not hold under humid conditions, and made my hair feel stiff and sticky, then made it feel dirty later in the day or the next morning.  </li>
            <li> Gives it body and is not sticky or stiff.  </li>
            <li> Is doesn&#x27;t make your hair stiff or greasy and does seem to provide volume.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair a but stiff.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair stiff.</li>
            <li> Sprays on easily, no stickiness as you are using.</li>
            <li> Made parts of my hair hard and stringy, added no volume not worth the money or time it took to get to me</li>
            <li> Tried it several times, in case my technique was bad, but with the same results-------couldn&#x27;t wait to wash my hair and rid it of this product.  </li>
            <li> When I touched my hair where it had been sprayed, the hair felt stiff and fake like a synthetic wig (even though I had even brushed through it after blow drying).</li>
            <li> is that the shipping is a little slow.</li>
            <li> Not sure I am supposed to name a seller,</li>
            <li> I DON&#x27;T USUALLY PUT ANY PRODUCTS ON MY HAIR,</li>
            <li> I usually go from one product to another</li>
            <li> When it finally got here, I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> I have short hair and just a few squirts at the base of the head, I massage it in and blow dry.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin flat hair.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed because I really want to find a product that gives my hair some volume.  </li>
            <li> I have thin hair and it gives volume without being weighted down.</li>
            <li> It was sticky in my hair and hard to get a comb through because of the tangles.  </li>
            <li> This product made my hair appear dull and it seemed a bit sticky.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes it can be hard to find in drugstores, but I know I can get it here.</li>
            <li> hard to avoid with volumizing products.  </li>
            <li> It sucks.</li>
            <li> and I have tried at least a thousand products for adding volume to my thin and limp hair.</li>
            <li> Way too heavy for my thin hair.</li>
            <li> If you have thin, limp hair you need this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> No more!</li>
            <li> No more flathead!</li>
            <li> It makes thin hair look like thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I was completely disappointed after using it several times.  </li>
            <li> Thin hair?</li>
            <li> My husband was not happy.</li>
            <li> Alas, I just started using a Paul Mitchell product and tried the volumizer spray today.  </li>
            <li> Then I did a google search on them, and that&#x27;s where I found that lots of people had complained about receiving fake products from that seller.  </li>
            <li> I have really thin hair</li>
            <li> If you are questionable of this product, I challenge you to try it.</li>
            <li> The second time I purchased it, TERRIBLE.  </li>
            <li> This was sticky and difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t feel thin anymore!  </li>
            <li> Does not make it difficult to blow out your hair.</li>
            <li> I use it whenever I blowdry my hair, and it does help volumize it control crazy frizz</li>
            <li> My product arrived in a timely fashion, but the can was dented and dirty.  </li>
            <li> AND the bottle has lasted over a year - that is crazy.  </li>
            <li> This product make brushing my hair afterwards impossible.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s crap...</li>
            <li> I had to give this away because of the terrible smell.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Miracle blow is an awesome product.  Gives you volume and is good for frizzy hair.  I use it before I blow dry my hair and also as hair spray.  Great value for the money.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, flat hair.  I&#x27;ve tried all the products/done all the tricks, nothing works for much longer than a few hours (or less, depending on the weather).  This is NOT a miracle, but I absolutely see results.  I have reordered it and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I just love this product!  It really gives my roots so much more lift when I blow dry my hair.  I would highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I purchased it because I use this product.</li>
            <li> This really does give my hair volume.  You don&#x27;t need to use a lot either.  I&#x27;d recommend it to others</li>
            <li> Great for limp hair! Smells great! I use this everyday and the bottle still last awhile! Very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> This is amazing!  I have shoulder length blond hair and this really is good for both volume and a final hold (if you allow it to dry). You can work with hair after it&#x27;s sprayed on dry hair only after it&#x27;s dry (which doesn&#x27;t take long).  Used on damp hair, it really does a great job holding hair if you round brush dry it.  I&#x27;ll be buying this again and do recommend it!</li>
            <li> This smells so good really adds volume and texture to my hair!!! I have tried alot of volumizers and this is by far the best ever!!!</li>
            <li> I love the texture and smell when using the product. i have gotten compliments on the smell of my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for finishing - great for fine hair</li>
            <li> This is just amazing.  My hair is very thin and this product makes my hair look twice as thick and easy to manage, plus your hair does not feel sticky.  i will always buy this instead of hair spray.  can not say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> Best hair spray on the market</li>
            <li> Great product for volume and holding power.</li>
            <li> Thin hair? No more! Terrific product for an aging lady with thinning hair! Absolutely a 10!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Easy to work with.  Does not require a lot to work.</li>
            <li> Great product, doesn&#x27;t leave a lot of residue on hair. Adds body and makes it easy to style.</li>
            <li> Chemical smell gives me a headache</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know what the point of this is. It sucks.</li>
            <li> just what my wife wanted</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  My hairdresser used this on me for the first time, and I loved the hold and the texture it creates.  This is a keeper in my book.</li>
            <li> I had to give this away because of the terrible smell. I&#x27;m not a hair spray user, or really that into many products. When I spray this and then blow-dried, the whole house stank like hair spray. My husband was not happy.</li>
            <li> The only volumizing spray I&#x27;ve tried that actually works on my fine, thin hair!</li>
            <li> Love this product for volume and fresh fragrence</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE the smell!!  Not sure ice really sane a difference in volume, but I love the smell so much I&#x27;ll continue using</li>
            <li> Love this product - GREAT PRICE!  :)  Would order again and again.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t produce the volume and height I expected, but then again nothing seems to work well in my hair.  It did, however, seem to coat the strands of hair to make it feel a bit fuller.  The product didn&#x27;t have a sticky feel which was a nice change.  I recommend it for short hair styles.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It gives volume to my hair and renews natural curl as hair dries naturally or using a hair dryer</li>
            <li> Even when paired with other products from the same line, this volumizer makes my hair really dry and even a little sticky. The search continues for an effective product that makes my hair bigger but not like a haystack.</li>
            <li> these products are fantastic, I think they are the best on the market and highly recommend them</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 is always good, but this really works.  If you have thinning hair, give this a try.  You will notice the difference.</li>
            <li> Smells &amp; works great!</li>
            <li> Great product that does not weigh your hair down, while giving body.</li>
            <li> it is a very nice product. It leaves my hair smooth and shiny and manageable. i have a fine hair and this makes my hair look bit fluffy.&lt;br /&gt;Good and value for money.</li>
            <li> Wonder product for fine hair!  Gives texture and fullness to my fine limp hair. I can certainly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This product has been the solution to volume for my super straight hair. The whole product line works for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff does EXACTLY what it promises.  Massive fullness/volume, not crunchy or sticky, etc.  It smells wonderful too.  The scent is a little strong at first but once you&#x27;re done drying it is much lighter.  My hair feels very bouncy as though a professional dried and styled it for me.  It&#x27;s a little pricey but it&#x27;s a fine mist so it should last a long time.  Definitely worth it if you have fine, limp hair.  Definitely glad I went for it.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: The first time I used this the results were as stated above.  Every day since then, it has barely made a difference.  I will not be using this product.  Seems to leave a build-up which negates its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself but ended up giving to my son&#x27;s girlfriend.  My hair is very thin and it made it feel oily too quickly.  On the other hand, my son&#x27;s girlfriend loves this product.  She has moderately think hair and she says it does not make her hair oily at all and loves how it feels.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, fine hair that typically gets oily when I use volumizer, but this stuff doesn&#x27;t get goopy or leave much of a residue! I can use it on damp or dry hair and it seems to work the same, which is nice when I&#x27;m in a hurry or just need a pick me up.  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff.  I am on my 3rd bottle and it&#x27;s been so great for my thinning, fine, lifeless colored (blonde) hair.  I spray it on wet hair before I comb out and blow dry and it really adds volume.  I also spray it on my brush during the day and it adds some thickness to my hair and keeps it from getting  flat and flyaway.  I spray it on and brush before bed too and it helps keep my hair together for the next day.  I just started using the its a 10 Leave in conditioner lite so I am looking forward to seeing how these two work together!</li>
            <li> Great for volume for thin fine hair and has sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Love what it does to my hair!</li>
            <li> Very sticky and hard to brush with blow dryer. Makes hair dry and unmanageable indoors or outdoors. Hair is not soft after use.</li>
            <li> Great for fine hair. Adds volume. Much cheaper than salon and even stores.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. Great hold. Just be careful using a styling or flatening iron after application, tends to cause breakage if heat is applied after application.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, did I mention it smells amazing?&lt;br /&gt;Quick shipping also. Good seller.</li>
            <li> I did not eceive my order of Miracle blow,unfortunately</li>
            <li> Not for me.  I used the product as stated on the back and I find my hair to be too sticky, unnatural and weighed down, no matter how lightly I use it. This goes into the garage sale pile, as it isn&#x27;t worth the bother of returning.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  GREAT FOR FINE HAIR.  MAKES CURLING MY HAIR MUCH EASIER!!!  IT&#x27;S LIKE A LIGHT HAIRSPRAY BUT DOESN&#x27;T TANGLE YOUR HAIR</li>
            <li> Great product. Problem is - it took a month to get it, by which time I had purchased it at a local retailer. Since a little goes a long way, I now have a few years&#x27; supply.</li>
            <li> This is the best product i have found for my fine hair so far!  Helps add volume without weighing it down, plus it&#x27;s easy to use and not sticky.  I love it!!</li>
            <li> This product is great for fine hair. It gives my hair shine and body  I use it on my hair wet and also hold after styling.</li>
            <li> My grocery store stopped carrying this product so luckily Amazon carried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this on my short to medium length hair after towel drying. (then you have to wash your hands b/c they get sticky)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then let it on while I brush my teeth. Then it&#x27;s ready to be styled with or without the hair dryer. Still need hairspray at the end of the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gives lift and let me style my hair instead of my hair flopping.</li>
            <li> light and perfect as a pre blow-dry product, best i&#x27;ve ever used, can&#x27;t live without it now !</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this product as I love It&#x27;s a 10 detangled spray.  The first time I used it, it made my hair flat and by the end of the day it looked dull.  At the time I was using a pretty cheap shampoo and conditioner so I figured I would wait until I got a better shamp/cond and it would be better.  Alas, I just started using a Paul Mitchell product and tried the volumizer spray today.  By the end of the day today my fine hair was dull, flat, and lifeless!  I was so disappointed because I really want to find a product that gives my hair some volume.  I just want to find a product that helps my fine hair and doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy!</li>
            <li> Not as good as I though</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best volumizer on the market.  My hair looks beautiful.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.The item arrived quickly, and I was glad because my other can of spray was almost out. I have fine, thin hair- and this product is wonderful. It makes my hair feel thick, and it holds style so much better. It also has a clean, salon smell. If you are questionable of this product, I challenge you to try it. You will be pleased!!! It also doubles as hairspray. Once I blow-dry and fix my hair, I spritz some of this on to hold my style. It has cut out the cost of flat-iron spray and hairspray- because it acts as both. I&#x27;m so happy I found it for this price online, $13/free ship, because it was $6 more in my local salon.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product through amazon a couple of times.  The first time, it was WONDErFUL.  Hair was full and soft, and it was easy to comb through to touch up.  The second time I purchased it, TERRIBLE.  It was sticky in my hair and hard to get a comb through because of the tangles.  Didn&#x27;t notice any extra fullness really either.  This had nothing to do with any difference in my hair other than using this product that came through two different sellers.  Obviously, I was curious why the difference.  I checked out the seller&#x27;s profile from my second purchase.  It seemed fine.  Then I did a google search on them, and that&#x27;s where I found that lots of people had complained about receiving fake products from that seller.  Not sure I am supposed to name a seller, so I won&#x27;t.  But I will say...google the seller&amp;#34;s name + &amp;#34;reviews&amp;#34;  before purchasing!</li>
            <li> JUST THE PRODUCT I HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR.MY HAIRDRESSER USED IT ,I LOVED IT, AND DECIDED TO PURCHASE A CAN.I SPRAY IT ONLY ON THE ROOTS OF MY CROWN ,FOR LIFT AND VOLUME.IT WORKS GREAT AND THE SMELL IS SUCH A BONUS! I DON&#x27;T USUALLY PUT ANY PRODUCTS ON MY HAIR,THIS IMPRESSED ME.I DO THINK IT IS WAY TOO PRICEY,BUT I ONLY NEED A BIT.I WILL USE IT AS A FINAL LIGHT SPRAY TOO.</li>
            <li> I am sick to death of reading great reviews, buying a product only to find it&#x27;s crap... I don&#x27;t know if people are paid to write great reviews or not, but it&#x27;s really starting to annoy me. Now that I&#x27;ve gotten that off my chest, this product is really great. I&#x27;ve bought others that aren&#x27;t and they won&#x27;t take back aerosols. THIS STUFF WORKS!! If you want fuller hair, you&#x27;ll be happy with this. I know I am. This and the Lanza Powder up Texturizer I will keep using because they work.. I wouldn&#x27;t lie. Promise.</li>
            <li> Way too heavy for my thin hair.</li>
            <li> Volume for sure, I don&#x27;t use daily but it does not seem to dry my hair out like other volumizer sprays.</li>
            <li> This product is a must have for me. I can blow dry my hair with lots of volume and shine or spray it on my hair and set it with rollers.Either way it&#x27;s a great product and has  great control with a  really nice scent too!</li>
            <li> I have fine, layered hair. This is a great product for my hair type. It&#x27;s not too heavy, it smells great, and it gives my hair great body. Definitely worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> After trying numerous volumizing hair products, I have finally found the one! Great scent, leaves no build-up or gross feeling in my hair, and gives it great volume! Also very affordable.</li>
            <li> Perfect for damp hair or dry. I have fine hair that needs a little volume. i spray just a small amount on my roots before rolling in a large curler. I use the blow dryer for a few minutes and that&#x27;s it. volume is there. I brush out &amp; style.</li>
            <li> my favorite hair product- EVER!</li>
            <li> My fine hair is limp no more! Plus, this stuff smells amaaaaaazing! Works all day long! Will be using this everyday now.</li>
            <li> I have course curly hair and this product makes my hair soft enough but still lets it curl.  The curls are perfect.  Great product.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist used this on me and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere!  I have really thin hair and this is the first volumizer that doesn&#x27;t make my oily.</li>
            <li> It is a must have for my hair!</li>
            <li> Great product! Gives lots of body but does not weigh my hair down. I highly recommend this product.  It&#x27; s also long lasting.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  it smells great and does a great job with adding needed volume to one&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product as I have used it before..thanks.  I purchased it at a beauty shop here in I.F. and no one carries it now.</li>
            <li> It works like a charm buy this product is you want more volume for your hair.  Mine is short but I stack it in the back, love it!</li>
            <li> I gave this product a 2 because it smells really good and is  good finishing spray with firm hold. I did not have good luck styling my hair with this at all. My hair is fine but not thin. This was sticky and difficult to work with. I did not get the volume I had hoped for and have much better luck with mousse. Not worth trying. Don&#x27;t spend the money.</li>
            <li> Made parts of my hair hard and stringy, added no volume not worth the money or time it took to get to me</li>
            <li> No cap and can was dented.</li>
            <li> This is a good volumizer and does not make your hair dry.  I use the shampoo and this together.</li>
            <li> I attempted to return this to the seller but could never get a response.  This product make brushing my hair afterwards impossible.  IT makes the texture of my hair super sticky and rough.  Very much do not like this product at all and not happy that I can&#x27;t get it returned.</li>
            <li> I can get texas sized hair if I really want. The volume lasts throught the humidity and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I was vey disappointed in this product, especially with all the other positive reviews of it.  I cannot believe that anyone would want to use the product I received.  It seemed to me just like an alcohol based hair spray with an added perfume overlay.  The smell was very strong, unpleasant and overpowering to me.  The product itself when used as directed did not seem to do anything it stated on the bottle. It did not make my fuller, did not hold under humid conditions, and made my hair feel stiff and sticky, then made it feel dirty later in the day or the next morning.  I feel like the other, positive reviewers were using an entirely different product from what I received.  I had to throw mine away after giving a good try over several days.  You could take any hairspray and spray it on your hair before blowdrying and get just as good results if not better.  And this stuff isn&#x27;t cheap, either.  I would definitely recommend against anybody buying this product.  It was a complete waste of money for me and I usually do not feel this strongly about a product.  Never had this experience before when buying on amazon and I shop a lot on here.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  Will continue to purchase</li>
            <li> Lots of body have to be careful to not use too much!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but with all the other great reviews I decided to try it and am very glad I did.  I have thin hair and it gives volume without being weighted down. It offers just enough texture to make me forget my hair is so thin.  HIGHLY recommend it!!</li>
            <li> great volumizer.  Worked as described.  Cheaper than some I have used and is just as good or better.  Will try again</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!  Purchased this for my sister who has super fine hair. She agrees this is a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; product as well. Very good price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Great service!</li>
            <li> I used to really like this miracle blow dry volumizer, but maybe my hair needs have changed over time. I find the miracle leave-in conditioner a lot more useful.</li>
            <li> Love it! It really does work and I have very fine hair!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so soft. Adds a little more volume but not much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Blow Dry VOlumizer adds a great deal of volume to my fine, thin hair.  Gives it body and is not sticky or stiff.  I really like it a lot!</li>
            <li> It works great on my hair. It gives it the right amount of volume without a build up feel on my hair.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Blow Dry Volumizer&amp;#34; is highly overrated and expensive. It smells nice, that&#x27;s about it. Will not be repurchasing this item</li>
            <li> Maybe it works for some people; however, for my fine thin hair, this product was horrid.  My hair always felt &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34;; like I&#x27;d used a whole can of hairspray on it at once.  This product only &amp;#34;volumized&amp;#34; the section of hair where it was directly sprayed (even though I then combed the product through my hair before blow drying).  Imagine a hair style where sections are flat and sections are poinked up (maybe good for Halloween, but not much else).  When I touched my hair where it had been sprayed, the hair felt stiff and fake like a synthetic wig (even though I had even brushed through it after blow drying). Tried it several times, in case my technique was bad, but with the same results-------couldn&#x27;t wait to wash my hair and rid it of this product.  Into the trash it went, despite being quite pricey----more fodder for the landfill......</li>
            <li> Great for crown to give some height to you hair.</li>
            <li> Great to use when you have fine hear.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product! Gives great volume to my flat hair and doesn&#x27;t smell like chemicals like some other boosting products do.</li>
            <li> I like this product. Is doesn&#x27;t make your hair stiff or greasy and does seem to provide volume. Hair looks healthier - I have processed hair that is thin and fine. This is the product for me.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a year and can&#x27;t go without it know. Gives extra volume which I really need. It won&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> WOW. really does work.  make &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; hair become full-bodied.  Visible difference. Looks of the spray can will not impress you, but what the product does sure will!</li>
            <li> My husband and mother both love this.  They both have thin hair and it does something that they say is magical!  I don&#x27;t have the problem so I can&#x27;t really explain but it smells good too.</li>
            <li> This product is now a must have for my daily hair ritual. It makes me hair super soft and manageable as well as holds my style all day. I can tell it is improving the texture of my hair as I use it. I would recommend this to anyone with fine hair.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair a but stiff. But smells good and keeps hair straight</li>
            <li> I have used many products for fine hair and this one is the best. I do not have to use a lot of this product as I have had to in the past with other products.  Since my hair is fine, this product gives my hair more volume in addition,  I use this as a hair spray and it does hold the hair, prevents the humidity from making it frizzy.  I hope they do not stop making this product.</li>
            <li> Okay, so i already have big, thick hair so i didn&#x27;t think i would see much more volume. I tried this for the first time this morning and WOAH. It&#x27;s so soft, and has SOOO much more volume. Miracle spray! Everyone needs a bottle of this stuff.</li>
            <li> This gave my thin hair extra oooomph.  It doesn&#x27;t work so well on dry hair as a styling mist, but maybe I am not using it properly.  I do love it after I wash my hair.  I just spray it on my damp hair, blow dry and the heat style.  My hair has so much extra body I am falling in love with it all over again.</li>
            <li> It does make a difference</li>
            <li> It sure adds volume, does not take much, very effective spray.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. The fragrance is an added bonus. It is light but sweet smelling. I have very thin, fine hair and this product made a difference. It has added to the strength of my hair. I recommend this to anyone that needs more volume.  It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of this to make a difference so the bottle will last awhile. I am happy to find something that helps.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair but very fine; on good hair days; my hair looks good; on bad hair days, high humidity, etc., I look like i have a flat head with little hair.  This product works great!  I usually go from one product to another but I have purchased this 3x in a row.</li>
            <li> This volumizer works well for my hair, which is fine and soft.  I use after shampooing and my hair comes out looking fuller and shiny.  There is no sticky build-up, as has sometimes been the case with other volumizers.  I would definitely buy the product again.&lt;br /&gt;CC</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Give great body with out weighing down you hair.  Sprays on easily, no stickiness as you are using.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and the spray gives me a lot of fullness that I don&#x27;t get without using it.  My husband uses it also.</li>
            <li> If you need body in your hair, this is the best product. Doesn&#x27;t weigh down fine hair and doesn&#x27;t leave a build up.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Best volumizer I&#x27;ve ever used. I have very fine hair so I can&#x27;t live without this product. Try it I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t be disappointed,</li>
            <li> ..and I am a follower..product works great and is very able to give my hair a good lift when applied properly...read the directions!</li>
            <li> Be carful not to spray too much near your roots or it can feel greasy. I like that it tames my flyaway as after drying my hair, no need for hairspray. Sometimes I don&#x27;t even have to flat iron my hair because this stuff can hold it straight after blow drying really well</li>
            <li> Anything It&#x27;s a 10 I would recommend to anybody. It is amazing stuff in a bottle. It arrived within a week of ordering. Definitely worth it</li>
            <li> I have short hair and just a few squirts at the base of the head, I massage it in and blow dry.  I instantly noticed the volume in my thick heavy hair which used to be so weighed down and looked plastered to my head.  Another good point about it is that it last all day!  Even in humid weather!  Yes, I like this product and have already ordered more so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> I originally found out about this product through my hairdresser. This product works good and smells great. It is almost a perfume! I love it!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and when I used this product my hair had a greasy film by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Holy Mackerel! This stuff is amazing. Do not hesitate, run, buy this. It volumizes all day long, your hair is silky and shiny. This is the best stuff since I do not know when and I have tried at least a thousand products for adding volume to my thin and limp hair. I feel like a hair model after using this &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle...&amp;#34;. Please believe me. Please. If you have thin, limp hair you need this stuff. You will be so happy. I am never, never, ever going to be without it ever!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have very fine, thin hair and it&#x27;s one of the only products that actually DOES add body whereas a lot of other products that claim to add body just weigh it down.  I put 4 stars only because it seemed to take a long time to receive but I may have misread the estimated delivery before I ordered.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product, especially after reading reviews. I was completely disappointed after using it several times.  It didn&#x27;t really add volume and left my hair feeling sticky and cruddy and looking dry.  It was the same as if I had used hairspray.  I have to say I LOVED the smell but threw it away since it was useless!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Makes my very fine, flat hair feel like I actually have a head of hair!  Worth it!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it more for the smell than anything else though. It smells amazing!! I use it whenever I blowdry my hair, and it does help volumize it control crazy frizz</li>
            <li> Great product and prompt delivery!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of very fine hair and this product really gives it some OMPH! Love it so much!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and this product works magic! My hairdresser used it on me two years ago and I have been using it ever since! It is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t look greasy. I was on vacation without it, and realized what a huge difference it made in my styling routine. No more flathead! Spray on after towel drying hair then blow dry! Don&#x27;t leave home without it!</li>
            <li> This product made my hair appear dull and it seemed a bit sticky.  It did provide volume, but I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> love this product. works great when used with the leave in lite. I have very thin flat hair. I used it on the roots while wet and then blow dry and great volume which lasts all day!</li>
            <li> It gives my fine hair some lift and body at the roots, where I mostly need it. I&#x27;ve been using it for some time and this is my second order!</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of products from cheap to expensive. Read the reviews on this and decided to try. It&#x27;s wonderful. I have fine limp hair. This product works, giving volume and texture. Love it!</li>
            <li> It truly is a miracle product! Spray it on your damp hair after shampooing &amp; voila... lots of volume. It even works on dry hair for touch ups. There&#x27;s nothing on the market that works better.</li>
            <li> This product does add body and fullness. It&#x27;s not really sticky or stiff...but it takes away all the shine. I&#x27;ll keep looking . I will try to use this up on just the under layers of my hair!</li>
            <li> not incredible but gives extra lift without being sticky or weighing hair down.  I use it sparingly though as it feels like it dries my hair some</li>
            <li> I use this product as a mild hairspray. It seems great! Kinda seems like a cologne. I&#x27;m sure it works great as a volumizer, as volumizers basically hold the same as a mild hairspray.</li>
            <li> I swear by It&#x27;s a 10 products, love the smell and feel of it!  I have fine limp hair and it helps put volume back in it!</li>
            <li> Really plumps up the hair and makes it fuller and more easier to style.  I found it brought life to my limp and very thin hair and gave me the ability to style into some cute styles.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it gives great volume without stickiness or apparent build-up.  My product arrived in a timely fashion, but the can was dented and dirty.  I expected better considering what I paid.</li>
            <li> My stylist used this to get that extra boost at the roots! Works great and I love all the It&#x27;s a 10 MIracle hair products and this is no exception.</li>
            <li> Keeps my baby fine hair in place and protects against split and sun damage. My hair dresser noticed a real difference.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I have thick hair so it&#x27;s always going flat after I blow dry it and style it. But after using this, it adds so much volume that lasts all day. Love it! I would recommend it to anyone who wants more volume. It&#x27;s not sticky at all and it&#x27;s really simple to use.</li>
            <li> My hair felt like I dumped goop into it. Left a white residue in my hair. Used it twice and threw it out. Would never buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because my hair is so limp...it needs lots of volume. This product works for me! I love it</li>
            <li> Love it. Works great for me.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my mom after she read the rave reviews.  She has medium length, baby fine hair. She loves this products. Makes her hair  more manageable  and gives it a shiny bounce without weighing it down. She highly recommends this product for people  with  fine, thin hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thinkI would like to add is that the shipping is a little slow.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing..my thin-looking hair here in Texas is always&lt;br /&gt;flat but when my hairdresser applied this to my hair last time&lt;br /&gt;it was such a drastic change..my hair is thicker, bouncy and&lt;br /&gt;just looks like I have so much more hair..i  love it!!!!!! I had to&lt;br /&gt;order it!!!</li>
            <li> This volumizer smells GREAT and gives my thin, straight hair the lift I need in the back. I use it regularly.</li>
            <li> Works great on my fine, thin hair. Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair frizzy as many products do. Good product.</li>
            <li> This , by FAR- the best volumizer I have ever used !  Was introduced to it at hair salon, and purchased at a savings through Amazon</li>
            <li> Love the price for this product to keep my frizzies at bay. Yes, you do need to shampoo more frequently than without, but at least it does not go sour smelling on your hair after 24 hours like most do. Love the fragrance and I don&#x27;t know why, just smells clean and fresh to me.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair so most products seem to weigh it down. Not this stuff!  Have been using it for a few years now.  Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This product works very well. I have fine hair but a lot of it and it gave me great volume. I get compliments all the time when I use it!</li>
            <li> This is the best I have found!  Lightly spray if you have fine hair,&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say enough about how great this works for fine hair!  Yes it is a 10!!</li>
            <li> I found this Volumizer to be the best I&#x27;ve tried yet...my hair usually falls flat by mid day, and the day I used this, it looked shiney AND full of volume.  Very happy with the results and will continue to use from now on.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair so I don&#x27;t really need volume, but this stuff makes my curls looks fabulous.  The weight of my hair will start pulling the curls out by the end of the day but not if I use this product. They stay bouncy.  The trick is to find the right amount of product for your hair so that it&#x27;s not too much (sticky) or too little (limp).  Once you find that balance you will be amazed.  I&#x27;ve looked for a long time for a product that wouldn&#x27;t make my hair stiff or crunchy and it&#x27;s finally here.  I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was told by my daughter to try this for my thin, white straight hair.  It works. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel thin anymore!  Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love it for my fine hair.  Got my first can from Target then couldn&#x27;t find it.  Amazon came through.  Makes my skimpy hair look thicker.</li>
            <li> This product once applied flattened the hair and it seemed greasy. Sent this product back.</li>
            <li> great product for hair</li>
            <li> This product is terrific gives you volume and shine. Does not make it difficult to blow out your hair. Easy to work with.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Really does what it says.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Sometimes it can be hard to find in drugstores, but I know I can get it here. Smells great and works well. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great stuff for baby fine short hair.  I use a gel first, then lift sections of hair and spray the roots with this stuff before blow-drying.  One of the best products for &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; hair.</li>
            <li> It made my hair a bit sticky when I use this so in that case you don&#x27;t have to use a lot I think which is good. It only saves me money lol.</li>
            <li> I have SUPER thin hair and this stuff is AWESOME. A few squirts of this when I&#x27;m blow drying my hair and I have SO much body. I&#x27;ve never found another product that even comes close in comparison. And this does not make your hair stiff, sticky or weigh it down at all. It smells INCREDIBLE, too!! It&#x27;s also great if you just need a little lift (or fragrance) in-between stylings. I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It does give my hair some lift. My hair is very thick and heavy, so anything that can give me that lift I really like.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really great. I have a lot of very fine hair that can get flat without a good blowout. This spray is pretty intense! It works so well that I have to be careful about using too much of it. Just some light bursts at the roots and a few in the rest of my hair, then combed through, results in some voluminous hair. The only downside might be that you can tell the change in the texture of your hair. It&#x27;s Ok for me, maybe not for others. I would highly recommend this for anyone who has fine hair, or thin hair. It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this on me and I was sold!  I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 years now and it never fails to live up to it&#x27;s promise...a miracle!  I have baby-fine, flat hair and this stuff really works!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic volumizer. It is easy to use and smells fantastic. I would highly recommend it to anyone who needs a little boost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for a great product for thin hair--and WOW! This product exceeded expectations. More volume, bounce--and it doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down/not sticky. VERY impressed. Look forward to exploring the It&#x27;s a 10 product line more. Thanks guys! :)</li>
            <li> I discovered this product when my hair dresser used it the first time on my hair. Since my hair responded well to the product, I decided to order the product so I would have it on hand at home. I love the product.</li>
            <li> got good volume, left my hair a little sticky. hard to avoid with volumizing products.  update:  I guess it took me a long time to realize this stuff DOES give a lot of volume, and also brings out my natural curl oddly enough. AND the bottle has lasted over a year - that is crazy.  i usually spray on damp hair, put my hair up in a bun for the night, and finish blow drying in the morning, and then my hair is kind of a poof ball but also wavy/curly.  that is a good thing though, because i run a curling iron through it to take advantage of the curl or let it settle a bit and i have volume for a few days.  my natural hair is pretty fine but wavy, and without some help, that isn&#x27;t a good combo. give this stuff a try!</li>
            <li> best for my fine super straight hair!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It smells great, but I&#x27;m not sure aerosols should be shipped via USPS</li>
            <li> Not sticky. Works well on fine hair. Used both on damp hair and then as final spray. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is a Miracle hair product. Just spray on hair before blow drying OR use on dry hair and set on rollers&lt;br /&gt;for a few minutes and your hair has so much body!  It makes thin hair look like thick hair.  The style holds&lt;br /&gt;all day.  Not sticky or drying.  Not at all heavy.  Does everything product promises.  I will never bother&lt;br /&gt;with other products again.  Use with the lite leave in conditioning after shampooing with the light shampoo -&lt;br /&gt;All for fine or thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;Prices from Amazon are lower than stores.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT&#x27;S A 10 HAIR PRODUCTS !</li>
            <li> Great product and it smells wonderful! Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for my fine hair! Definitely adds the volume without weighing my hair down!</li>
            <li> I found this product to be just what it says...doesn&#x27;t built up on your hair like hair spray...gives shine and manageability to your hair...Love it...Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I could not believe the price on this! I was already using it as I purchased it at a salon for double the price. Vendor was prompt and priced to sell!</li>
            <li> It does work well to add volume to my thin hair, however the scent is too strong for me.</li>
            <li> I love this brand, and I decided that I&#x27;d give this a product a go because I&#x27;m a sucker for volume. After weeks and weeks of waiting, Amazon had to reship my package. When it finally got here, I was not impressed. It makes my hair stiff.</li>
            <li> I love this root pump! It works better than any other I have tried! Well worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Love this volumizer!  My hair is very fine and most volumizers end up making my hair feel sticky, weighted down and tangled.  This product is weightless and leaves my hair feeling very soft, but also somehow manages to give it lots of extra volume.  I use it with It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave In Treatment, blow dry my hair upside down, and have a perfect hair day.</li>
            <li> It really helps my fine hair style better.</li>
            <li> I have used this product prior, but purchased it in a salon and paid more.  It helps fine straight hair and really does give it volume.</li>
    </ol>
