            <li>It covers very easily and looks great -</li>
            <li>I am glad I went with the platinum!  </li>
            <li>This color is amazing and does not look powdery in your hair.  </li>
            <li>but I do sections with the alternating colors, matching my highlights and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>Nice tone.</li>
            <li>how easy it is to use!</li>

            <li>I was surprised how great it looks and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product, would highly recommend, and when I run out I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>It covers well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment!!!</li>
            <li>They should re formulate to make it work (like other companies have done successfully btw, so it&#x27;s not impossible), or</li>
            <li>Did not love the product, does not have great coverage.</li>
            <li>I have very light blonde highlights, and I vacillated between purchasing the &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34; or the &amp;#34;platinum&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>pretty good to tone grey but doesn&#x27;t completely cover it.</li>
            <li>Really it kinda lightens the entire area because you have to reapply so many times</li>

            <li>Nothing but not by much.</li>
            <li>I am brunette and dye my hair light blonde.</li>
            <li>It takes forever to apply and doesn&#x27;t stay very well.</li>
            <li>The platinum blonde was much too pale for my hair however (and I have light blonde hair) and didn&#x27;t do a good job covering my roots.</li>

            <li>It will help you save money on frequent trips to the salon.</li>
            <li>Pretty much a waste of money.</li>

            <li> While it won&#x27;t completely get rid of brown roots, it lightens them and makes them much less obvious/harsh.</li>
            <li> Works well on my highlights and hides my grey and dark regrowth.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to get it in the same place every time.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re going to keep getting bad reviews from brunettes(a large portion of the population who dye their hair blonde!)</li>
            <li> it will save me a few weeks before I need to return to the salon to get my regrowth highlighted.  </li>
            <li> A waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Application is difficult and does not hold to hair.  </li>
            <li> Color is weird, application is weird-</li>
            <li> Horrible product for the amount of money they charge.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not anywhere close to description given on product.  Application is difficult and does not hold to hair.  Should have returned but was moving during this purchase and so on......</li>
            <li> It works but you have to go over it several times. Doesn&#x27;t really paint on like the reviews. Really it kinda lightens the entire area because you have to reapply so many times it&#x27;s hard to get it in the same place every time. I use it only in a pinch.</li>
            <li> Did not love the product, does not have great coverage. Better than. Nothing but not by much.</li>
            <li> It covers well and is easy to use. It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> Works well on my highlights and hides my grey and dark regrowth. I didn&#x27;t have a problem with application.</li>
            <li> This made my color last an extra couple of weeks.  I was surprised how great it looks and how easy it is to use!</li>
            <li> I have very light blonde highlights, and I vacillated between purchasing the &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34; or the &amp;#34;platinum&amp;#34;.  I am glad I went with the platinum!  It covers very easily and looks great - it will save me a few weeks before I need to return to the salon to get my regrowth highlighted.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product, would highly recommend, and when I run out I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I bought color WOW in the two blond shades to help touch up my highlights as they grow in.  This color is amazing and does not look powdery in your hair.  I do not use this to cpletely paint my roots but I do sections with the alternating colors, matching my highlights and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> I bought Platinum because my hair is very blonde and it worked perfectly between touchups. I would definitely recommend to anyone. It will help you save money on frequent trips to the salon.</li>
            <li> Came on time.  Wonderful, easy to use. Perfect!</li>
            <li> Does not cover at all. You might as well put baby powder on your hair. The color doesn&#x27;t match and is yellow like crayon. I got the lightest color for blonde hair and it doesnt cover roots, doesnt match and actually makes my blonde hair that the &amp;#34;color wow&amp;#34; touch next to the roots yellow and darker than my hair color. A waste of time and money. Now imagine all the scams and people that are fooled to buy it once would be enough for them to make tons of money.</li>
            <li> it doesnt cover like the video shows</li>
            <li> Fast shipment!!! Product is pretty good. Doesn&#x27;t cover completely, but definitely helps with the dark roots. I also use it to take the brassiness out and make my hair blonder.</li>
            <li> Horrible product for the amount of money they charge. Platinum doesn&#x27;t cover brown hair at all. I guess you have to already be a blonde to get this product to work. They should re formulate to make it work (like other companies have done successfully btw, so it&#x27;s not impossible), or they&#x27;re going to keep getting bad reviews from brunettes(a large portion of the population who dye their hair blonde!)</li>
            <li> Amazing product. This stuff is incredible.</li>
            <li> I heard lots of great things about this root cover so I decided to try it. The platinum blonde was much too pale for my hair however (and I have light blonde hair) and didn&#x27;t do a good job covering my roots. Pretty much a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Color is weird, application is weird- I regret buying</li>
            <li> did not cover as I would like it too.</li>
            <li> pretty good to tone grey but doesn&#x27;t completely cover it. Nice tone.</li>
            <li> I am brunette and dye my hair light blonde. I had a last minute event 1 day before I was supposed to get my hair done and couldn&#x27;t reschedule my hair appt so used this product. While it won&#x27;t completely get rid of brown roots, it lightens them and makes them much less obvious/harsh. Good for a quick fix.</li>
            <li> It takes forever to apply and doesn&#x27;t stay very well. Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> The color goes on great, however it&#x27;s gone in two hours, go to lunch with the girls look great, by the time you leave your gray is back....JUST WONDERFUL.  Think twice before you purchase</li>
