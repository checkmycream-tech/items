            <li>Great product .... keep it coming</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t give it a good recommendation</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found it!</li>
            <li>When i was pregnant the progesterone made me happy &amp; in a good mood</li>
            <li>I started using this product 5 months ago and the results are amazing.  </li>
            <li>Quite honestly I haven&#x27;t felt any difference since using AllVia Progensa</li>
            <li>This is the best natural progesterone cream I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m feeling better after a weeks use.  </li>
            <li>I will know more after continued use and will post at that time.</li>
            <li>I have recommended it to many others.</li>
            <li>This is so much better than hormone replacement for menopausal women.  </li>
            <li>I got my product fast and in great condition.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m expecting TWINS!! :)</li>
            <li>Glad i gave it a try.</li>
            <li>This product was also recommended by my chiropractor...:)</li>
            <li>This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite formula.</li>
            <li>Why spend time and precious additional funds on prescribed, compounded progesterone?</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s any better than Progensa 20.</li>
            <li>I give it 5 stars and two thumbs up. :)</li>
            <li>My progesterone went up a couple points in the 4 - 6 weeks I&#x27;ve been using this - so it&#x27;s doing something. :-)  </li>
            <li>I was able to feel more calm and also helped me sleep better</li>
            <li>this works great for natural hormone replacement, was recommended by a doctor.</li>
            <li>It has a good texture, easy and fast to apply, with no smell.</li>
            <li>Oh, sweet relief!</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply; pre-measure dosage; no smell; and it works.</li>
            <li>I will say it&#x27;s easy to use, pump works fine and it rubs in well.</li>
            <li>and i noticed a HUGE difference in my PMS.  </li>
            <li>Now I understand why some women are fabulous in their 50s.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fabulous product, and I trust it explicitly.</li>
            <li>Item came quickly and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>This product stopped my hot flashes!  </li>
            <li>If you are guy and you are wanting to supplement progesterone without stinking of lavender or some other flowery scent, this is a good one to use.</li>
            <li>problems with the bottle not pumping right</li>
            <li>Dispenser delivers reliable, consistent amounts of product.</li>
            <li>I use 80mg in the morning and 80 at night, but started out much higher.</li>
            <li>Hot flashes gone within a couple days.</li>
            <li>Only been using it for 3 week&#x27;s need to give more time.</li>
            <li>Still have some hot flashes, but they&#x27;re fewer.  </li>
            <li>I have a short luteal phase and after 14 months of trying to get pregnant, someone recommended this cream to me and it worked in the first month!!</li>
            <li>Good price relative to our local pharmacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On the positive side it helped my insomnia and bloating.</li>
            <li>The cream dries quickly and is not heavy.  </li>
            <li>( I have no heart condition; it&#x27;s purely hormonal)  </li>
            <li>However, this product has really helped me to balance some of my hormonal imbalance.</li>
            <li>I feel it is a really helpful product</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t really do much for me</li>
            <li>but until I added progesterone it did not matter how much i dieted and exercised my body</li>
            <li>I have been using this product, which is natural and good for your body, for a few years</li>
            <li>After I finally found a good doctor willing to actually run hormone tests that check cortisol, progesterone and thyroid which was a saliva test collection over 24 hour period and a blood test I was given this product for the low progesterone.  </li>
            <li>If anyone knows of any other source of bioidentical harmony treatment, I&#x27;d love to hear from you.</li>
            <li>I went to about 7 doctors who told me to go on a diet or to exercise more and didnt believe me that I followed my nutritionist and practically lived in a gym with no results other than exhaustion.</li>
            <li>I was able to loose a little weight, be a tad more outgoing and sociable, sleep a little better, and it has helped some what mellow my mood and not be so PMS intense.</li>
            <li>Hoping that will change as this product came highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This product seems to work very well as far as hormonal balance.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re right back.  </li>
            <li>I pay a little extra for this product because it goes on nicely and seems to absorb well</li>
            <li>W A STICKER &amp;#34; NEW &amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I feel like a new woman.</li>
            <li>Hoping next month using a higher dose will make a difference.</li>
            <li>I have lost 1 inch of belly fat after only one week of use as well as having the first &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; period in about 18 years.</li>
            <li>I actually stopped on purpose to see if it was really helping and</li>
            <li>I had a complete HYSTO in May 2013.  </li>
            <li>So far this isn&#x27;t the miracle</li>
            <li>So far not working quite the way I hoped.  </li>
            <li>In my early 20s I started suffering the symptoms of all of them.  </li>
            <li>So far no noticable change or affect.</li>
            <li>Finally, I found a MD who specialized in complimentary medicine, and endocrine disorders and was a medical doctor who ran the tests and helped me.  </li>
            <li>Soon after I began using this, my hot flashes decreased significantly.  </li>
            <li>I was having  jittery feelings all the time, and it was my chiropractor that suggested that I try Progesterone cream to calm me down.  </li>
            <li>I had tried different ones, this one I really noticed a big difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 40 and have had heavy cycles my whole life and the oral pill made my triglycerides go sky high.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m having a lot of trouble getting the right amount to use.</li>
            <li>I have been using Progensa 20 for close to 10 years and have used it (and saliva testing) to balance my own hormones where medical doctors and prescribed, compounded bio-identical creams have failed.</li>

            <li> I have been using Progensa 20 for close to 10 years and have used it (and saliva testing) to balance my own hormones where medical doctors and prescribed, compounded bio-identical creams have failed.</li>
            <li> Over the last couple of years, one of the most extreme symptoms I&#x27;ve suffered during menopause is heart palpitations; not the occasional flutter, but much worse.</li>
            <li> (I found the full does too much so adjusted it down) and it has seriously saved my sanity, my marriage and my sex life!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I believe I could use a stronger dose, because I think I am very Progesterone deficient in order to see extreme results, but I can definitely attest to this product working.</li>
            <li> and I was diagnosed by an MD with low progesterone also known as estrogen dominance which is very common among people with low thyroid and low cortisol levels.</li>
            <li> weight gain, water weight, heavy periods, dense breast tissue, fatigue, weakness, irritability, low sex drive.  </li>
            <li> Already taking evening primrose and soya isoflavines to beat other symptoms I was at my wits end (and on the verge of a divorce) when a friend recommended this product.</li>
            <li> I hoped it would be like other women said</li>
            <li> Seriously after all the energy to workout finally I was sore and rubbed a little where I hurt and instantly the pain was gone.</li>
            <li> Easy to rub in and does not smell bad.</li>
            <li> and it calms me down.  </li>
            <li> Invariably, the moment I&#x27;d lay down to sleep, they would start.  </li>
            <li> Now I use less than recommended.  </li>
            <li> When my periods returned a year later after my son was born the horrible PMS came right back.  </li>
            <li> Most doctors are stupid when it comes to obesity and fatigue they assume your a food addict or lazy.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this worked, but it didn&#x27;t hurt trying.</li>
            <li> At 50 I was sufferring badly from dried up sexual organs and an over whelming desire to become the &#x27;psychotic she devil&#x27; and muder everyone!</li>
            <li> but next month I&#x27;m going to apply it twice a day to see if it reduces my heavy flow and helps with my PMS symptoms including severe irritation and anger for a few days, like I&#x27;m coming out of my skin.</li>
            <li> Estrogen did not work for me at all, made me extremely tired.  </li>
            <li> I was not moody, grumpy, mean, angry, irritated.  </li>
            <li> so disappointed as I had read other reviews about it and truly felt it was going to make a difference for me, but nothing has changed for me.</li>
            <li> I was desperate to try anything.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for years after trying synthetic hormones which made me feel awful.  </li>
            <li> I get a horrible headache.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Did not work as described</li>
            <li> Great ***** will buy again</li>
            <li> Great  product that seems to be working well.</li>
            <li> I pay a little extra for this product because it goes on nicely and seems to absorb well</li>
            <li> I had tried different ones, this one I really noticed a big difference. I was able to feel more calm and also helped me sleep better which at this point in my life are my biggest complaints,,anxiety and insomnia... I actually stopped on purpose to see if it was really helping and omword ..I did notice the difference</li>
            <li> At 50 I was sufferring badly from dried up sexual organs and an over whelming desire to become the &#x27;psychotic she devil&#x27; and muder everyone! Already taking evening primrose and soya isoflavines to beat other symptoms I was at my wits end (and on the verge of a divorce) when a friend recommended this product. One squirt in the morning on thigh, abdomen or arm for 3 out of 4 weeks (I found the full does too much so adjusted it down) and it has seriously saved my sanity, my marriage and my sex life!</li>
            <li> Quite honestly I haven&#x27;t felt any difference since using AllVia Progensa 20.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so disappointed as I had read other reviews about it and truly felt it was going to make a difference for me, but nothing has changed for me. If anyone knows of any other source of bioidentical harmony treatment, I&#x27;d love to hear from you. Aryelle</li>
            <li> OUT OF DATE W A STICKER &amp;#34; NEW &amp;#34; OVER OOD CODE .NOT HAPPY</li>
            <li> After 40, the hormones start to drop. This helped with my insomnia and weight loss. Now I sleep each night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m feeling better after a weeks use.  It may be a placebo effect, but I&#x27;ll take it  I will know more after continued use and will post at that time.</li>
            <li> It has a good texture, easy and fast to apply, with no smell. The dosage seems to work well for my mood. I use 1 pump per day during the 2 weeks in my cycle when I need it. I&#x27;m so glad I found it!</li>
            <li> problems with the bottle not pumping right</li>
            <li> This is the best natural progesterone cream I have ever used.  I have been using it for years after trying synthetic hormones which made me feel awful.  I have recommended it to many others.</li>
            <li> This cream is working out well for me.  Its not as absorbent as others I have tried but it is working well.  Hope this is helpful.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. Before I bought this product I read the reviews, and it seemed as though the woman had the same issues and symptoms as I did. I have self diagnosed my self with Estrogen Dominance, the side affects for this are too lengthy to name here. However, this product has really helped me to balance some of my hormonal imbalance. I was able to loose a little weight, be a tad more outgoing and sociable, sleep a little better, and it has helped some what mellow my mood and not be so PMS intense. I also like that is pre-measured for you. I believe I could use a stronger dose, because I think I am very Progesterone deficient in order to see extreme results, but I can definitely attest to this product working. I have bought it again, and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a long time.  Helps with menopause symptoms.  Easy to use.  Dispenser delivers reliable, consistent amounts of product.</li>
            <li> I started using this product 5 months ago and the results are amazing.  This is so much better than hormone replacement for menopausal women.  IT is a need, not a want!  I got my product fast and in great condition.</li>
            <li> I have a short luteal phase and after 14 months of trying to get pregnant, someone recommended this cream to me and it worked in the first month!! Maybe too well...I&#x27;m expecting TWINS!! :)</li>
            <li> I had a complete HYSTO in May 2013.  Estrogen did not work for me at all, made me extremely tired.  I was having  jittery feelings all the time, and it was my chiropractor that suggested that I try Progesterone cream to calm me down.  My Gyno said I did not need Progesterone since I did not have a uterus.  I was desperate to try anything.  This stuff works.  I just use a dab only when I think I need it and it calms me down.  Hope it works great for others as well.</li>
            <li> So far this isn&#x27;t the miracle I hoped it would be like other women said but next month I&#x27;m going to apply it twice a day to see if it reduces my heavy flow and helps with my PMS symptoms including severe irritation and anger for a few days, like I&#x27;m coming out of my skin. I&#x27;m 40 and have had heavy cycles my whole life and the oral pill made my triglycerides go sky high. I will say it&#x27;s easy to use, pump works fine and it rubs in well. Hoping next month using a higher dose will make a difference. I will update my review.</li>
            <li> This is just what my body needed. Easy to apply; pre-measure dosage; no smell; and it works. I just wished that I had known about it a couple of years ago.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this worked, but it didn&#x27;t hurt trying.</li>
            <li> So far not working quite the way I hoped.  I feel it is a really helpful product but for some reason every time I&#x27;ve applied it I get a horrible headache.&lt;br /&gt;I stop using it they go away, I try it again they&#x27;re right back.  On the positive side it helped my insomnia and bloating.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t really do much for me so I can&#x27;t give it a good recommendation but I also realize everybody&#x27;s different and it may work for some.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product, which is natural and good for your body, for a few years and it does a great job at balancing my hormones.</li>
            <li> I know this works. My family loves it. Hee Hee😚</li>
            <li> Item came quickly and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I am 35 and have always had issues with PMS.  When i was pregnant the progesterone made me happy &amp; in a good mood my entire pregnancy.  When my periods returned a year later after my son was born the horrible PMS came right back.  I have only used this cream for a week for my last cycle and i noticed a HUGE difference in my PMS.  I was not moody, grumpy, mean, angry, irritated.  The cream dries quickly and is not heavy.  Hopefully it works next cycle! Glad i gave it a try.</li>
            <li> This product stopped my hot flashes!  Oh, sweet relief!</li>
            <li> I wish I found this 15 years ago. I feel like a new woman.Now I understand why some women are fabulous in their 50s. This takes away aches and pains and gives you energy. Seriously after all the energy to workout finally I was sore and rubbed a little where I hurt and instantly the pain was gone. I use 80mg in the morning and 80 at night, but started out much higher. My husband was so jealous he went out and bought a workout enhancer for himself.</li>
            <li> Easy to rub in and does not smell bad. If you are guy and you are wanting to supplement progesterone without stinking of lavender or some other flowery scent, this is a good one to use.</li>
            <li> Soon after I began using this, my hot flashes decreased significantly.  Now I use less than recommended.  This product was also recommended by my chiropractor...:)</li>
            <li> Good price relative to our local pharmacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful progesterone supplement for post-menopausal hormone balance issues.</li>
            <li> Hot flashes gone within a couple days.</li>
            <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite formula.</li>
            <li> Great product .... keep it coming</li>
            <li> this works great for natural hormone replacement, was recommended by a doctor.</li>
            <li> I have been all out of whack for years and I don&#x27;t have insurance and can&#x27;t afford a DR I read about this to help with belly fat, infertility, irregular periods, and excess hair. This product is a godsend!!! I am crying as I write this because of how much it has done in just a very short time... I have lost 1 inch of belly fat after only one week of use as well as having the first &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; period in about 18 years. If I could kiss whoever makes this I would. I am buying my mom some next!!!</li>
            <li> I am 29 I have two kids and I was diagnosed by an MD with low progesterone also known as estrogen dominance which is very common among people with low thyroid and low cortisol levels. I suffer from all three. In my early 20s I started suffering the symptoms of all of them.  weight gain, water weight, heavy periods, dense breast tissue, fatigue, weakness, irritability, low sex drive.  After I finally found a good doctor willing to actually run hormone tests that check cortisol, progesterone and thyroid which was a saliva test collection over 24 hour period and a blood test I was given this product for the low progesterone.  From day 1-14 of my cycle I would apply 1 squirt to my skin and after a couple of days my symptoms improved and after 4 months my weight started coming off finally after 3 years of struggling after having my daughter I used this product and I had energy and strength again and finally lost 60 lbs going from a size 22 back to an 8.  I had been on thyroid meds for years but until I added progesterone it did not matter how much i dieted and exercised my body just wouldn&#x27;t burn the fat off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if this sounds like you it will work. Most doctors are stupid when it comes to obesity and fatigue they assume your a food addict or lazy. I went to about 7 doctors who told me to go on a diet or to exercise more and didnt believe me that I followed my nutritionist and practically lived in a gym with no results other than exhaustion. Finally, I found a MD who specialized in complimentary medicine, and endocrine disorders and was a medical doctor who ran the tests and helped me.  This product worked for me!!!  All of my symptoms are gone.</li>
            <li> Only been using it for 3 week&#x27;s need to give more time.</li>
            <li> Over the last couple of years, one of the most extreme symptoms I&#x27;ve suffered during menopause is heart palpitations; not the occasional flutter, but much worse. ( I have no heart condition; it&#x27;s purely hormonal)  Invariably, the moment I&#x27;d lay down to sleep, they would start.  Every 3-7 beats, my pulse would skip and flop around like a fish out of water. This would continue until I&#x27;d fall asleep.  After using Progensa 20 for only a week or so, I realized to my delight that the palpitations were entirely gone!  Still have some hot flashes, but they&#x27;re fewer.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Have only used for 3 days. So far no noticable change or affect. Hoping that will change as this product came highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have been using Progensa 20 for close to 10 years and have used it (and saliva testing) to balance my own hormones where medical doctors and prescribed, compounded bio-identical creams have failed. Specialists have commended me on the results I have achieved and have advised me to just keep doing &amp;#34;whatever it is&amp;#34; I do. That &amp;#34;whatever it is&amp;#34; is AllVia Progensa 20. It&#x27;s a fabulous product, and I trust it explicitly. Why spend time and precious additional funds on prescribed, compounded progesterone? There&#x27;s nothing out there (whether compounded, prescription, or OTC) that&#x27;s any better than Progensa 20. I give it 5 stars and two thumbs up. :)</li>
            <li> This product seems to work very well as far as hormonal balance. However, the pump dispenser is not working properly and every time a different amount comes out of that bottle. I&#x27;m having a lot of trouble getting the right amount to use.</li>
            <li> My progesterone went up a couple points in the 4 - 6 weeks I&#x27;ve been using this - so it&#x27;s doing something. :-)  Will continue to use.</li>
