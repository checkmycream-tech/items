            <li>So the GREAT product becomes obsolete after the &amp;#34;improved version&amp;#34; (which isn&#x27;t improved......</li>

            <li>Have always liked these razors!</li>
            <li>so was happy to find it here for a good price.  </li>
            <li>But, it does what its supposed to do, and it shaves fairly well for the price.</li>
            <li>really good quality.</li>
            <li>The quality I expect from Venus for a  good price</li>
            <li>So, I decided to splurge on a good razor.</li>
            <li>Still a good razor, but</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>I got this for about $4 after the amazon coupon which was a good deal.</li>
            <li>I bought this one for my wife and she loved it.</li>
            <li>but the original is the best and closest shave for me.</li>
            <li>I was so happy when I discovered that I would be able to replace it.</li>
            <li>leaves legs very smooth!</li>
            <li>If so, I will gladly change this review as the Venus product is great and not at fault..</li>
            <li>I purchased this razor and was very pleased with it .</li>
            <li>Love my Gillette Venus razors!  </li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE Venus Razors and blades!</li>
            <li>I love this razor!</li>
            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>I love that you can mix and match cartridges now!</li>
            <li>Works so much better than Embrace!</li>
            <li>I love these blades!  </li>
            <li>This one gives a nice, smooth shave and I haven&#x27;t cut myself once!!</li>
            <li>This is so smooth on the skin and the angle is great.</li>
            <li>I get a great smooth shave.</li>
            <li>These are nice</li>
            <li>I shave my legs every day and this razor is durable and effective.</li>
            <li>Got it at a great price, and I love that it brings more than one blade.</li>
            <li>Nice color.  </li>
            <li>Nice smooth shave with a great price.</li>
            <li>Would&#x27;ve liked it to come with a mountable piece to place on shower</li>
            <li>It shaves nice and has a nice handle to hold.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast, arrived good shape, price OK very happy, thank you.</li>
            <li>Nice razor.</li>
            <li>This one didn&#x27;t do a great job, and the blade dulled and caused razor burn really quickly.</li>
            <li>Love this razor, leaves my legs super smooth :D</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for probably a couple years now, and it is without a doubt a great razor and well worth the money.</li>
            <li>These will be suitable for now though.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to be able to replace</li>
            <li>I am happily satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li>Makes my wife&#x27;s legs nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t love Venus. :)</li>
            <li>This razor is okay.</li>
            <li>I feel more at risk of knicks and cuts with this.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I found that the venus disposables do a better job than these.</li>
            <li>Great Product, Fast Delivery</li>
            <li>Gotta love these razors.</li>
            <li>Love this razor.</li>
            <li>Much better than disposable razors.</li>
            <li>They give me a smooth shave every time!  </li>
            <li>Definitely one of the best razors for woman.</li>
            <li>Will look elsewhere for a better one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a razor don&#x27;t know what to say:)</li>
            <li>Love the way the Venus head flexes.</li>
            <li>This razor has always been a favorite.</li>
            <li>I love venus razors and this is no exception.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I love it too.</li>
            <li>I love these razors.  </li>
            <li>The quality of this razor is outstanding.</li>
            <li>I have purchased many cheaper razors but they do not compare with the Venus razor.</li>
            <li>I have always been a fan of mach3 and using it for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li>and I love them even more than the original!</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be more excited about shaving!</li>
            <li>but this razor gives my legs a nice clean shave.</li>
            <li>Works great and high quality.</li>
            <li>This razor is extremely easy to use and it leaves me skin feeling very smooth.</li>
            <li>Love my Gillette razors, these were great for my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Just a clean shave!</li>
            <li>and he loved it so much, he bought one.  </li>
            <li>Blades easy to attach and remove.</li>
            <li>So easy and smooth to use.</li>
            <li>How many rows of blades do you really need?!!  </li>
            <li>It also holds up to four replacement cartridges, so they&#x27;re easily found and easily accessible.</li>
            <li>but it just doesn&#x27;t feel nearly as smooth or luxurious on my legs.</li>
            <li>The shave I get with the razor is so smooth</li>
            <li>smooth shaving without any irreation or nicks &amp; cuts.</li>
            <li>The product is great of course, but it was shipped with only one of the razor blade refills.  </li>
            <li>After using the Venus I won&#x27;t be using the cheap one again.</li>
            <li>Wife Said she Gets A Smooth Shave Blades</li>
            <li>I now understand why her legs (+) are always silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a Gilette Power razor for men for years, and my legs just weren&#x27;t getting as smooth as I&#x27;d wanted,</li>
            <li>It looks like this is a conscious strategy by Venus to make the 3-blades (which used to be good) so obnoxious that everyone has to switch to the 5-blade.</li>
            <li>It would be much better if this product came with one good blade rather than 2 essentially unusable ones.</li>
            <li>but sure wish you could find a woman&#x27;s razor that did cost so much!</li>
            <li>Since I had a bunch of the original cartridges, I didn&#x27;t want to buy a newer version.</li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;Gillette Venus Original Women&#x27;s Razor&amp;#34; was on sale</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my Venus Original Razor for years now</li>
            <li>Helps to use a rich emollient shaving cream as well.</li>
            <li>Well worth it!</li>
            <li>That being said, my legs are super smooth after I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>I found this super cheap on amazon, so I thought I&#x27;d try.  </li>
            <li>I see why it was super cheap.  </li>
            <li>Nice razor for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have other Venus razors and think they&#x27;re great.  </li>
            <li>Gillette has offered new versions and improvements over the years, but my favorite is still the original Venus.  </li>
            <li>Yeah, I probably go too quickly</li>
            <li>I got a really smooth save and love he soft grip.</li>
            <li>A nice razor as expected :)</li>
            <li>Decent razors, the Venus razor with 5 blades work so much better though.</li>
            <li>They also use the Mach-3 blade heads, if you need/want a smaller head for precision work, but the wider Venus heads do prevent nicks and cuts over knees, ankles, and sensitive areas (men or women) because they reduce the pressure and work to smooth out the skin more effectively.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li>The Venus razors are great, except the blades do start to rust a little quicker than some others.</li>
            <li>Good razor with blades that last much longer than disposable razors.</li>
            <li>I keep it in the shower using their handy pod that houses 4 extra cartridges.  </li>
            <li>Smooth shave every time, and none of the sticky gooey stuff like on the more recent gillette razors.</li>
            <li>and I rarely ever nick myself.</li>
            <li>These are just right.</li>
            <li>This handle is fine (just like the old)</li>
            <li>Good control on shaving, and a broad enough head that it doesn&#x27;t take forever to shave my legs!  </li>
            <li>I bought more and gave to my family members to try, now they are using only this razor.</li>
            <li>Funny story -</li>
            <li>it is actually a disappointment) and people like me are left to track down the original GREAT version which worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>and I have a large storage of cartridges on hand.</li>
            <li>I really like the convenient shower \\&quot;holder\\&quot; that comes with it too; you just stick it to your shower, and it&#x27;s always there when you need it.</li>
            <li>I was very upset when the dog chewed mine up.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight.  </li>
            <li>I used to use the cheap disposable ones and they just don&#x27;t get a close enough shave, plus I cut myself a lot with those.</li>
            <li>This holder is very flimsy plastic.</li>
            <li>since I don&#x27;t shave that much use a much cheaper and disposable store brand.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need shaving cream and the five blades makes it much easier to shave closer to your skin.</li>
            <li>I recently received the Venus Embrace and the Venus &amp; Olay cartridges free in the Influenster VoxBox</li>
            <li>I really like the Venus razor.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>hairs seem to clog the blades more than other razors</li>
            <li>There is only one refill and one original head.  </li>
            <li>So I now have received a total of 4 Gillette Venus Original Women&#x27;s Razor 1 Razor Handle and 2 Razor Blade Refills 1 Count.</li>
            <li>The Venus razors are so easy to hold even when your hands are soapy and wet, and the moisturizing strip really does make your legs feel smoother after you shave.</li>
            <li>There are so many new different razors  of the same brand triple blade, lotion sizes</li>
            <li>He said his has lasted much longer his other razor&#x27;s and it gives a close, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>Good shave but found less useage and less sharp than the more premium venus systems with replaceable blades.</li>
            <li>SO grateful that someone finally came up with a design that makes it easy to open molded plastic without jacking up your blood pressure because you can&#x27;t get your purchase out!</li>
            <li>Ordered for my daughter, she only uses Venus razors and the price was right.</li>
            <li>She loves the new razor.</li>
            <li>and these are still the best at providing a close shave, and last longer (because there is less garbage lubrication to dull the blades).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The razors themselves feel very rough, and don&#x27;t seem to give a smooth close leg shave,  even in conjunction with Nivea shaving</li>
            <li>I wanted an extra razor for travel, exactly like my normal Venus razor.</li>
            <li>Folks shopping for razors should note - the Venus Original razor has a different &amp;#34;attachment head&amp;#34; than those of the Simply Venus razor.  </li>
            <li>I usually use the venus embrace disposables, which I love.  </li>
            <li>It is becoming harder to find at your local drug store.</li>
            <li>I had this original Venus razor for years until my cleaning lady dropped it causing it to break in half.  </li>
            <li>but the blades it comes with are tiny - much narrower than the old 3-blades.</li>
            <li>My old stand-by was always Schick Quattro; I figured I&#x27;d give this one a try</li>
            <li>Like the soft grip handle.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a replacement after someone inadvertently threw my old one out.</li>
            <li>Only con is refills are pricey, but since they last awhile its worth it.</li>
            <li>The cartridges may seem a little pricey but they are well worth the price!</li>
            <li>True to form with most of the Venus line the head is awkwardly shaped and misses nooks and curves, instead focusing on making the product appear &amp;#34;feminine&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Before this came out I was using a man&#x27;s razor because they simply didn&#x27;t make a decent version for women.  </li>
            <li>I get a smooth shave on my tough leg hair yet this shaver is gentle on my underarms.</li>
            <li>No other razor works as well as the Gillette Venus razors.</li>
            <li>The listing apparently hasn&#x27;t been updated to reflect the new packs that just have 1 razor with blade and one extra blade.</li>
            <li>This is the reason I requested a replacement order, as the original order had the same missing parts.</li>
            <li>I expected too much from it</li>
            <li>I really need to be careful.</li>
            <li>I only wish the refills weren&#x27;t so expensive, but overall a good product.</li>
            <li>I have really fine hair, and can usually use a razor for a long time.</li>
            <li>The razor seems the exact same in every way except color (green), but it is cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are also the exact same as the &amp;#34;Body&amp;#34; razors for men, but are blue instead of green.  </li>
            <li>Normally, I would not purchase the refills, but Amazon&#x27;s price are extremely affordable.</li>
            <li>And if you&#x27;re in to being environmentally friendly, it also produces a lot less plastic waste than a disposable.</li>

            <li> Love my Gillette Venus razors!  </li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE Venus Razors and blades!</li>
            <li> I love this razor!</li>
            <li> I love these!</li>
            <li> I love that you can mix and match cartridges now!</li>
            <li> Works so much better than Embrace!</li>
            <li> I love these blades!  </li>
            <li> This one gives a nice, smooth shave and I haven&#x27;t cut myself once!!</li>
            <li> This is so smooth on the skin and the angle is great.</li>
            <li> I get a great smooth shave.</li>
            <li> These are nice</li>
            <li> I shave my legs every day and this razor is durable and effective.</li>
            <li> Got it at a great price, and I love that it brings more than one blade.</li>
            <li> Nice color.  </li>
            <li> Nice smooth shave with a great price.</li>
            <li> Would&#x27;ve liked it to come with a mountable piece to place on shower</li>
            <li> It shaves nice and has a nice handle to hold.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast, arrived good shape, price OK very happy, thank you.</li>
            <li> Nice razor.</li>
            <li> This one didn&#x27;t do a great job, and the blade dulled and caused razor burn really quickly.</li>
            <li> Love this razor, leaves my legs super smooth :D</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for probably a couple years now, and it is without a doubt a great razor and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> These will be suitable for now though.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to be able to replace</li>
            <li> I am happily satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li> Makes my wife&#x27;s legs nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love Venus. :)</li>
            <li> This razor is okay.</li>
            <li> I feel more at risk of knicks and cuts with this.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I found that the venus disposables do a better job than these.</li>
            <li> Great Product, Fast Delivery</li>
            <li> Gotta love these razors.</li>
            <li> Love this razor.</li>
            <li> Much better than disposable razors.</li>
            <li> They give me a smooth shave every time!  </li>
            <li> Definitely one of the best razors for woman.</li>
            <li> Will look elsewhere for a better one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a razor don&#x27;t know what to say:)</li>
            <li> Love the way the Venus head flexes.</li>
            <li> This razor has always been a favorite.</li>
            <li> I love venus razors and this is no exception.</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I love it too.</li>
            <li> I love these razors.  </li>
            <li> The quality of this razor is outstanding.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many cheaper razors but they do not compare with the Venus razor.</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of mach3 and using it for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li> and I love them even more than the original!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be more excited about shaving!</li>
            <li> but this razor gives my legs a nice clean shave.</li>
            <li> Works great and high quality.</li>
            <li> This razor is extremely easy to use and it leaves me skin feeling very smooth.</li>
            <li> Love my Gillette razors, these were great for my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Just a clean shave!</li>
            <li> and he loved it so much, he bought one.  </li>
            <li> Blades easy to attach and remove.</li>
            <li> So easy and smooth to use.</li>
            <li> How many rows of blades do you really need?!!  </li>
            <li> It also holds up to four replacement cartridges, so they&#x27;re easily found and easily accessible.</li>
            <li> but it just doesn&#x27;t feel nearly as smooth or luxurious on my legs.</li>
            <li> The shave I get with the razor is so smooth</li>
            <li> smooth shaving without any irreation or nicks &amp; cuts.</li>
            <li> The product is great of course, but it was shipped with only one of the razor blade refills.  </li>
            <li> After using the Venus I won&#x27;t be using the cheap one again.</li>
            <li> Wife Said she Gets A Smooth Shave Blades</li>
            <li> I now understand why her legs (+) are always silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Gilette Power razor for men for years, and my legs just weren&#x27;t getting as smooth as I&#x27;d wanted,</li>
            <li> It looks like this is a conscious strategy by Venus to make the 3-blades (which used to be good) so obnoxious that everyone has to switch to the 5-blade.</li>
            <li> It would be much better if this product came with one good blade rather than 2 essentially unusable ones.</li>
            <li> but sure wish you could find a woman&#x27;s razor that did cost so much!</li>
            <li> Since I had a bunch of the original cartridges, I didn&#x27;t want to buy a newer version.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;Gillette Venus Original Women&#x27;s Razor&amp;#34; was on sale</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Venus Original Razor for years now</li>
            <li> Helps to use a rich emollient shaving cream as well.</li>
            <li> Well worth it!</li>
            <li> That being said, my legs are super smooth after I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> I found this super cheap on amazon, so I thought I&#x27;d try.  </li>
            <li> I see why it was super cheap.  </li>
            <li> Nice razor for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have other Venus razors and think they&#x27;re great.  </li>
            <li> Gillette has offered new versions and improvements over the years, but my favorite is still the original Venus.  </li>
            <li> Yeah, I probably go too quickly</li>
            <li> I got a really smooth save and love he soft grip.</li>
            <li> A nice razor as expected :)</li>
            <li> Decent razors, the Venus razor with 5 blades work so much better though.</li>
            <li> They also use the Mach-3 blade heads, if you need/want a smaller head for precision work, but the wider Venus heads do prevent nicks and cuts over knees, ankles, and sensitive areas (men or women) because they reduce the pressure and work to smooth out the skin more effectively.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> The Venus razors are great, except the blades do start to rust a little quicker than some others.</li>
            <li> Good razor with blades that last much longer than disposable razors.</li>
            <li> I keep it in the shower using their handy pod that houses 4 extra cartridges.  </li>
            <li> Smooth shave every time, and none of the sticky gooey stuff like on the more recent gillette razors.</li>
            <li> and I rarely ever nick myself.</li>
            <li> These are just right.</li>
            <li> This handle is fine (just like the old)</li>
            <li> Good control on shaving, and a broad enough head that it doesn&#x27;t take forever to shave my legs!  </li>
            <li> I bought more and gave to my family members to try, now they are using only this razor.</li>
            <li> Funny story -</li>
            <li> it is actually a disappointment) and people like me are left to track down the original GREAT version which worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> and I have a large storage of cartridges on hand.</li>
            <li> I really like the convenient shower \\&quot;holder\\&quot; that comes with it too; you just stick it to your shower, and it&#x27;s always there when you need it.</li>
            <li> I was very upset when the dog chewed mine up.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight.  </li>
            <li> I used to use the cheap disposable ones and they just don&#x27;t get a close enough shave, plus I cut myself a lot with those.</li>
            <li> This holder is very flimsy plastic.</li>
            <li> since I don&#x27;t shave that much use a much cheaper and disposable store brand.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need shaving cream and the five blades makes it much easier to shave closer to your skin.</li>
            <li> I recently received the Venus Embrace and the Venus &amp; Olay cartridges free in the Influenster VoxBox</li>
            <li> I really like the Venus razor.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> hairs seem to clog the blades more than other razors</li>
            <li> There is only one refill and one original head.  </li>
            <li> So I now have received a total of 4 Gillette Venus Original Women&#x27;s Razor 1 Razor Handle and 2 Razor Blade Refills 1 Count.</li>
            <li> The Venus razors are so easy to hold even when your hands are soapy and wet, and the moisturizing strip really does make your legs feel smoother after you shave.</li>
            <li> There are so many new different razors  of the same brand triple blade, lotion sizes</li>
            <li> He said his has lasted much longer his other razor&#x27;s and it gives a close, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> Good shave but found less useage and less sharp than the more premium venus systems with replaceable blades.</li>
            <li> SO grateful that someone finally came up with a design that makes it easy to open molded plastic without jacking up your blood pressure because you can&#x27;t get your purchase out!</li>
            <li> Ordered for my daughter, she only uses Venus razors and the price was right.</li>
            <li> She loves the new razor.</li>
            <li> and these are still the best at providing a close shave, and last longer (because there is less garbage lubrication to dull the blades).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The razors themselves feel very rough, and don&#x27;t seem to give a smooth close leg shave,  even in conjunction with Nivea shaving</li>
            <li> I wanted an extra razor for travel, exactly like my normal Venus razor.</li>
            <li> Folks shopping for razors should note - the Venus Original razor has a different &amp;#34;attachment head&amp;#34; than those of the Simply Venus razor.  </li>
            <li> I usually use the venus embrace disposables, which I love.  </li>
            <li> It is becoming harder to find at your local drug store.</li>
            <li> I had this original Venus razor for years until my cleaning lady dropped it causing it to break in half.  </li>
            <li> but the blades it comes with are tiny - much narrower than the old 3-blades.</li>
            <li> My old stand-by was always Schick Quattro; I figured I&#x27;d give this one a try</li>
            <li> Like the soft grip handle.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement after someone inadvertently threw my old one out.</li>
            <li> Only con is refills are pricey, but since they last awhile its worth it.</li>
            <li> The cartridges may seem a little pricey but they are well worth the price!</li>
            <li> True to form with most of the Venus line the head is awkwardly shaped and misses nooks and curves, instead focusing on making the product appear &amp;#34;feminine&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Before this came out I was using a man&#x27;s razor because they simply didn&#x27;t make a decent version for women.  </li>
            <li> I get a smooth shave on my tough leg hair yet this shaver is gentle on my underarms.</li>
            <li> No other razor works as well as the Gillette Venus razors.</li>
            <li> The listing apparently hasn&#x27;t been updated to reflect the new packs that just have 1 razor with blade and one extra blade.</li>
            <li> This is the reason I requested a replacement order, as the original order had the same missing parts.</li>
            <li> I expected too much from it</li>
            <li> I really need to be careful.</li>
            <li> I only wish the refills weren&#x27;t so expensive, but overall a good product.</li>
            <li> I have really fine hair, and can usually use a razor for a long time.</li>
            <li> The razor seems the exact same in every way except color (green), but it is cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are also the exact same as the &amp;#34;Body&amp;#34; razors for men, but are blue instead of green.  </li>
            <li> Normally, I would not purchase the refills, but Amazon&#x27;s price are extremely affordable.</li>
            <li> And if you&#x27;re in to being environmentally friendly, it also produces a lot less plastic waste than a disposable.</li>
            <li> The razor last quite a long time, so you won&#x27;t have to worry about buying refills too often.</li>
            <li> Last A Long Time.</li>
            <li> They last a long time (I&#x27;m talking</li>
            <li> I was shocked how much better my legs felt!</li>
            <li> Not sure what is different in this new packaging for formula, I had bumps and rashes on legs.</li>
            <li> When Venus razors were first introduced, they had very thick soap strips around the razor so that each one would last a month.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have used Gillette&#x27;s products for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I could not believe how close the shave was and how long the shave lasted...</li>
            <li> I get much better results with a much less expensive 2-blade razor that is sold in a 10-pack.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting and sharp blades.</li>
            <li> so it can dry.</li>
            <li> Kind of disappointed because of that.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find some replacement blades because they discontinue them to get to you to buy a new system.</li>
            <li> These last forever, compared to other razors!</li>
            <li> Gillette seems to last longer with less irritation than no-name competition we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The blades stay sharp for a long time.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this brand years ago and don&#x27;t recall them being this rough.</li>
            <li> They get all the hair with minimal effort.</li>
            <li> What i expected.</li>
            <li> Both packages are opened at back and 1 of the razor blade refills are missing from each package.</li>
            <li> so it takes a little longer to shave due to going over the same spot a couple of times.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s really sharp</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want their legs nicked up like some other razors do.</li>
            <li> As I expected, shaving cartridges for one variety do NOT fit the other, and vice versa.</li>
            <li> I have been using Venus razors for at least ten years now, and nothing gives me a smoother shave.</li>
            <li> This is and has been for at least ten years</li>
            <li> I literally had blood dripping down my legs.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut up or destroy my skin.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed that the in-shower holder is no longer included in this starter kit as it was the main reason I ordered this particular razor set.</li>
            <li> I have in the past,</li>
            <li> I have been using them for the past 8 or so years</li>
            <li> and I hardly ever get nicks.</li>
            <li> Hard to find this razor</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is too small of an issue to send back to the shipper, but still an annoying issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like this brand of razor as I don&#x27;t end up cutting my legs as I have with some other brands.</li>
            <li> This one I bought in 2013 had a soap strip so thin that it lasted</li>
            <li> I wish Gillette would just leave what isn&#x27;t broken......</li>
            <li> Not impressed with the quality.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t come with a shower pod or shower hook (even though the picture does show a shower pod).</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love my Gillette Venus razors!  Good control on shaving, and a broad enough head that it doesn&#x27;t take forever to shave my legs!  I only wish the refills weren&#x27;t so expensive, but overall a good product.</li>
            <li> Great transaction! Very happy!</li>
            <li> These are nice but sure wish you could find a woman&#x27;s razor that did cost so much!</li>
            <li> I get much better results with a much less expensive 2-blade razor that is sold in a 10-pack.  Will not buy the Gillette Venus again.</li>
            <li> The only brand I use! These last forever, compared to other razors!</li>
            <li> Great items, great price, great shipping from a great dealer. Thank you.</li>
            <li> So convenient to have this on my subscribe and save list.  I never have to think about running out of blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for probably a couple years now, and it is without a doubt a great razor and well worth the money. I really like the convenient shower \\&quot;holder\\&quot; that comes with it too; you just stick it to your shower, and it&#x27;s always there when you need it. It also holds up to four replacement cartridges, so they&#x27;re easily found and easily accessible.

            <li> I had this original Venus razor for years until my cleaning lady dropped it causing it to break in half.  Since I had a bunch of the original cartridges, I didn&#x27;t want to buy a newer version. Amazon to the rescue!</li>
            <li> Nice razor for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Its a Venus razor. It shaves, which is what it is supposed to do.  True to form with most of the Venus line the head is awkwardly shaped and misses nooks and curves, instead focusing on making the product appear &amp;#34;feminine&amp;#34;.  But, it does what its supposed to do, and it shaves fairly well for the price.</li>
            <li> Best razor.  There are so many new different razors  of the same brand triple blade, lotion sizes but the original is the best and closest shave for me. It is becoming harder to find at your local drug store. Amazon always has stock when I need it</li>
            <li> I get a smooth shave on my tough leg hair yet this shaver is gentle on my underarms. I was very upset when the dog chewed mine up. I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to be able to replace and I have a large storage of cartridges on hand. I was so happy when I discovered that I would be able to replace it. We&#x27;re back in business!</li>
            <li> These razors are the devil. I cut my legs all up and I hardly ever get nicks. I literally had blood dripping down my legs. I used to buy this brand years ago and don&#x27;t recall them being this rough. Never again</li>
            <li> I am happily satisfied with this product.  I shave my legs every day and this razor is durable and effective.</li>
            <li> Got it at a great price, and I love that it brings more than one blade.</li>
            <li> Long lasting and sharp blades. This was my second time ordering it!</li>
            <li> The best Venus razor made, and still the cheapest.  We&#x27;ve tried the 4-blade, 5-blade,  and &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; optional lubrication... and these are still the best at providing a close shave, and last longer (because there is less garbage lubrication to dull the blades).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are also the exact same as the &amp;#34;Body&amp;#34; razors for men, but are blue instead of green.  They also use the Mach-3 blade heads, if you need/want a smaller head for precision work, but the wider Venus heads do prevent nicks and cuts over knees, ankles, and sensitive areas (men or women) because they reduce the pressure and work to smooth out the skin more effectively.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE Venus Razors and blades! I won&#x27;t use any other.</li>
            <li> MY FAVORITE RAZOR ever!!! Love this razor, leaves my legs super smooth :D</li>
            <li> I have been using Venus razors for at least ten years now, and nothing gives me a smoother shave. I also like that I can always find them on Amazon at a great price!</li>
            <li> Love my Gillette razors, these were great for my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Great razors.  Get it!</li>
            <li> Folks shopping for razors should note - the Venus Original razor has a different &amp;#34;attachment head&amp;#34; than those of the Simply Venus razor.  As I expected, shaving cartridges for one variety do NOT fit the other, and vice versa.</li>
            <li> Not sure what is different in this new packaging for formula, I had bumps and rashes on legs. Not buying it again atleast this version of it</li>
            <li> She loves the new razor. Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> My daughter has me order these time after time!</li>
            <li> Gillette seems to last longer with less irritation than no-name competition we&#x27;ve tried. What we have found is that you can save money by purchasing the &amp;#34;Gilette Body Razor&amp;#34; designed for men. The razor seems the exact same in every way except color (green), but it is cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you are planning on buying this, search Amazon for &amp;#34;Gilette Body Razor&amp;#34; instead and see if it is cheaper.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;Gillette Venus Original Women&#x27;s Razor&amp;#34; was on sale so I purchased it for my wife to try.  She has been very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> this razor is great!! really good quality. leaves legs very smooth!</li>
            <li> The quality I expect from Venus for a  good price</li>
            <li> Makes my wife&#x27;s legs nice and smooth. She won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> So convenient to have this on my subscribe and save list. I never have to think about running out of blades</li>
            <li> Very lightweight.  Follows curves.  No drags, no nicks.  Nice color.  Arrives with extra blade.  Blades easy to attach and remove.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love Venus. :)</li>
            <li> Good razor with blades that last much longer than disposable razors. When I haven&#x27;t shaved my legs for a while (winter months) hairs seem to clog the blades more than other razors so it takes a little longer to shave due to going over the same spot a couple of times. That being said, my legs are super smooth after I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> Have always liked these razors!</li>
            <li> This razor is okay. I expected too much from it I think. My old stand-by was always Schick Quattro; I figured I&#x27;d give this one a try but it just doesn&#x27;t feel nearly as smooth or luxurious on my legs. I feel more at risk of knicks and cuts with this.</li>
            <li> Nice smooth shave with a great price.</li>
            <li> I love this razor! I used to use the cheap disposable ones and they just don&#x27;t get a close enough shave, plus I cut myself a lot with those. So, I decided to splurge on a good razor. This one gives a nice, smooth shave and I haven&#x27;t cut myself once!! The razor last quite a long time, so you won&#x27;t have to worry about buying refills too often. I definitely recommend this to all women!!</li>
            <li> Before this came out I was using a man&#x27;s razor because they simply didn&#x27;t make a decent version for women.  I&#x27;ve had my Venus Original Razor for years now and I love it.  I keep it in the shower using their handy pod that houses 4 extra cartridges.  The shave I get with the razor is so smooth and I never have to worry about nicks or cuts!  Great Razor!!  Debi B.</li>
            <li> Works great, saves plastic.</li>
            <li> it was offered at a great price too</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed that the in-shower holder is no longer included in this starter kit as it was the main reason I ordered this particular razor set. The listing apparently hasn&#x27;t been updated to reflect the new packs that just have 1 razor with blade and one extra blade. I have received two in the last couple weeks and they were both the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The razors themselves feel very rough, and don&#x27;t seem to give a smooth close leg shave,  even in conjunction with Nivea shaving cr&amp;egrave;me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I&#x27;ll be going back to using Shick Hydrosilk.</li>
            <li> I found that the venus disposables do a better job than these. Won&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
            <li> So easy and smooth to use. It&#x27;s the best razor I have used. no complains at all.</li>
            <li> I have other Venus razors and think they&#x27;re great.  The one I got here doesn&#x27;t have the release button, seems like a counterfeit or something.  You basically have to just yank off the blades when you want to replace it.  Still a good razor, but I can&#x27;t believe Gillette would produce one like this.</li>
            <li> this product is labeled that it has 2 head refills.  The word REFILL implies that it is a replacement to somethign already used.  There is only one refill and one original head.  The back of my package is also cut open as others have stated about their product.  I will be checking in the stores to see if they are also packaged in this manner.  I feel this product&#x27;s labeling is missleading.  or there has intentionally been a razor head removed.</li>
            <li> Hard to find this razor so was happy to find it here for a good price.  Like the soft grip handle. I gave it 4 stars because I wanted a holder to put in the shower to hold the razor. This holder is very flimsy plastic. It still works but I expect it to break soon. I just used double stick tape to attach it to my shower tile.</li>
            <li> I have always just bought the Venus disposables but decided to get this after a coupon clipping from Amazon. I could not believe the difference between this and the disposable Venus. This is so smooth on the skin and the angle is great. Does a great job of shaving. I did not realize that there could be a difference. To me a razor was a razor. I will not go back to the disposables again.</li>
            <li> Love this razor!! Will buy again!!</li>
            <li> Great Product, Fast Delivery</li>
            <li> Gotta love these razors. smooth shaving without any irreation or nicks &amp; cuts. great way to start spring shaving for those sun dresses</li>
            <li> I like this brand of razor as I don&#x27;t end up cutting my legs as I have with some other brands. Yeah, I probably go too quickly but this razor gives my legs a nice clean shave. Helps to use a rich emollient shaving cream as well.</li>
            <li> The product is great of course, but it was shipped with only one of the razor blade refills.  As it was shipped and purchased from Amazon directly, there is no real recourse besides leaving this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is too small of an issue to send back to the shipper, but still an annoying issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully they will read this one star rating and get back to me.. If so, I will gladly change this review as the Venus product is great and not at fault..</li>
            <li> I love these! Great price.</li>
            <li> Delivered as described</li>
            <li> This is one of the best razor I have used.</li>
            <li> Love this razor. I have in the past, since I don&#x27;t shave that much use a much cheaper and disposable store brand. After using the Venus I won&#x27;t be using the cheap one again. I got a really smooth save and love he soft grip. Razor came with two blades.</li>
            <li> This review is for the molded plastic the razors came in. SO grateful that someone finally came up with a design that makes it easy to open molded plastic without jacking up your blood pressure because you can&#x27;t get your purchase out!</li>
            <li> Wife Said she Gets A Smooth Shave Blades Last A Long Time.</li>
            <li> It works. Would&#x27;ve liked it to come with a mountable piece to place on shower</li>
            <li> It works well. The blades stay sharp for a long time. Doesn&#x27;t cut up or destroy my skin. Only con is refills are pricey, but since they last awhile its worth it. Much better than disposable razors.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor and was very pleased with it . You can shave and not cut yourself., especially around the knees. I bought more and gave to my family members to try, now they are using only this razor.</li>
            <li> These razors are awesome!  They give me a smooth shave every time!  They are all I will use now!  I like how I can keep using the handle and all I have to replace is the blade.</li>
            <li> Great razor! It always get a close shave and I never have any problems with razor burn or nicks. It has a holder that sticks to the wall so it can dry. Definitely one of the best razors for woman. I always get them when there is a amazon coupon for a great price.</li>
            <li> A nice razor as expected :) It shaves nice and has a nice handle to hold. Didn&#x27;t cause me any issues. Great value!</li>
            <li> Works great and high quality.</li>
            <li> This oldie but goodie is still great! Smooth shave every time, and none of the sticky gooey stuff like on the more recent gillette razors.</li>
            <li> This razor is extremely easy to use and it leaves me skin feeling very smooth. You don&#x27;t need shaving cream and the five blades makes it much easier to shave closer to your skin. I recommend it to all women and you can simply refill it when the razor is worn out.</li>
            <li> This is and has been for at least ten years my go to razor...  I love their products!!!  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my daughter, she only uses Venus razors and the price was right.</li>
            <li> No other razor works as well as the Gillette Venus razors. Disposable razors just don&#x27;t give as close a shave. The Venus razors are so easy to hold even when your hands are soapy and wet, and the moisturizing strip really does make your legs feel smoother after you shave. I love that you can mix and match cartridges now! I recently received the Venus Embrace and the Venus &amp; Olay cartridges free in the Influenster VoxBox and I love them even more than the original! The cartridges may seem a little pricey but they are well worth the price! I can&#x27;t even imagine going back to regular disposable razors, the Gillette Venus is a must for me.</li>
            <li> Great razor! I prefer this style over the ones with the added moisturizer. No nicks or cuts.... Just a clean shave!</li>
            <li> I usually use the venus embrace disposables, which I love.  I found this super cheap on amazon, so I thought I&#x27;d try.  I see why it was super cheap.  I have really fine hair, and can usually use a razor for a long time. This one didn&#x27;t do a great job, and the blade dulled and caused razor burn really quickly.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these razors!! I have been using them for the past 8 or so years and I haven&#x27;t used any others!</li>
            <li> I really like the Venus razor.  I bought this as a replacement after someone inadvertently threw my old one out.</li>
            <li> They get all the hair with minimal effort. That&#x27;s all I want and all I can ask from a razor.</li>
            <li> I wanted an extra razor for travel, exactly like my normal Venus razor. This handle is fine (just like the old) but the blades it comes with are tiny - much narrower than the old 3-blades. It looks like this is a conscious strategy by Venus to make the 3-blades (which used to be good) so obnoxious that everyone has to switch to the 5-blade. Very disappointing. It would be much better if this product came with one good blade rather than 2 essentially unusable ones.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with the quality. Lightweight, almost disposable quality razor with changeable heads. Will look elsewhere for a better one.</li>
            <li> What i expected. I was happy that it came with a holder. It&#x27;s a razor don&#x27;t know what to say:)</li>
            <li> When Venus razors were first introduced, they had very thick soap strips around the razor so that each one would last a month. This one I bought in 2013 had a soap strip so thin that it lasted 2 shaves only. Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Love the way the Venus head flexes.</li>
            <li> This razor has always been a favorite.</li>
            <li> I used this once and it&#x27;s good. But it&#x27;s really sharp so  I really need to be careful.</li>
            <li> Price was great with coupon. Arrived on time and boxed well. I love venus razors and this is no exception. Would recommend to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want their legs nicked up like some other razors do.</li>
            <li> Love this.  Funny story - my brother tried it once when he visited and he loved it so much, he bought one.  He said his has lasted much longer his other razor&#x27;s and it gives a close, smooth shave.  That&#x27;s why I love it too.</li>
            <li> Without question, this is the best razor I&#x27;ve used.  It gives me the closest shave with the fewest nicks.  I&#x27;ve been using this for years, and I won&#x27;t give it up.  I do think that the replacement blades are overpriced, but I&#x27;m still buying them.  For me, who was chopping up my legs all over the place, this was a godsend.  Gillette has offered new versions and improvements over the years, but my favorite is still the original Venus.  It&#x27;s my razor of choice.</li>
            <li> I love these razors.  They&#x27;re great.  They last a long time (I&#x27;m talking I&#x27;ll use the same blade for a couple months) and I rarely ever nick myself.</li>
            <li> The quality of this razor is outstanding. Normally, I would not purchase the refills, but Amazon&#x27;s price are extremely affordable. I added this razor to my cart at $8 and Amazon instantly offered a $5 off coupon. Couldn&#x27;t be more excited about shaving!</li>
            <li> slipped in on the deal -- great</li>
            <li> Decent razors, the Venus razor with 5 blades work so much better though. These will be suitable for now though.</li>
            <li> These razors are great, and this was a great deal with the coupon. The Venus razors are great, except the blades do start to rust a little quicker than some others.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many cheaper razors but they do not compare with the Venus razor. Close shave without the nics. Well worth it!</li>
            <li> I wish Gillette would just leave what isn&#x27;t broken...... etc, etc, etc! I don&#x27;t understand WHY a company has a GREAT product..........and they decide to &amp;#34;improve&amp;#34; it. WHY? So the GREAT product becomes obsolete after the &amp;#34;improved version&amp;#34; (which isn&#x27;t improved...... it is actually a disappointment) and people like me are left to track down the original GREAT version which worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> I have used Gillette&#x27;s products for a long time.  I always trust their quality.  So I brought two packages this time for my friends. Thanks</li>
            <li> This IS the replacement order for items.&lt;br /&gt;Product has been tampered with. Both packages are opened at back and 1 of the razor blade refills are missing from each package. Is anyone checking responses? This is the reason I requested a replacement order, as the original order had the same missing parts. So I now have received a total of 4 Gillette Venus Original Women&#x27;s Razor 1 Razor Handle and 2 Razor Blade Refills 1 Count.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this for my husband. He has the type of beard that after he shaves it looks like he needs to do it again. This is the only razor that you can see that he actually shaved. Wonderful wonderful razor.</li>
            <li> Works so much better than Embrace!</li>
            <li> Item replacing used same item. Shipped fast, arrived good shape, price OK very happy, thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy.... out of necessity I \\&quot;borrowed\\&quot; this razor... I could not believe how close the shave was and how long the shave lasted... I did not get a 5-o&#x27;clock shadow at 5-o&#x27;clock... I now understand why her legs (+) are always silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Venus is my preferred brand. Razors like these are semi disposable. It is hard to find some replacement blades because they discontinue them to get to you to buy a new system. I got this for about $4 after the amazon coupon which was a good deal. Good shave but found less useage and less sharp than the more premium venus systems with replaceable blades.</li>
            <li> I get a great smooth shave. I&#x27;ve been using a Gilette Power razor for men for years, and my legs just weren&#x27;t getting as smooth as I&#x27;d wanted, so I decided to go back to razors intended for women. I was shocked how much better my legs felt!</li>
            <li> I love these blades!  How many rows of blades do you really need?!!  These are just right.</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of mach3 and using it for more than 10 years. I bought this one for my wife and she loved it.</li>
            <li> Nice razor. Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t come with a shower pod or shower hook (even though the picture does show a shower pod). I bought it so I could have a shower pod to store my razor in the shower. Kind of disappointed because of that.</li>
