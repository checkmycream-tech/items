            <li>It gets my hair very clean</li>
            <li>I usually LOVE all ENJOY products</li>
            <li>Enjoy helps me maintain my color and keep my hair looking healthy.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Enjoy lover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>I purchased this Shampoo for several reason but the most important is it was rated very good on the EWG.org website that gives details and ratings to personal care products and their levels of toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li>Great to find a shampoo that is sulfate free, but has the other properties I want.</li>
            <li>Nothing special for its price.</li>
            <li>This product is now my new favorite.</li>
            <li>all while keeping my hair shiny and fresh.  </li>
            <li>This is the only sulfate free shampoo (of the many I&#x27;ve tried) that meets all of my criteria.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an avid fan of this shampoo.ive been using it for a while.</li>
            <li>Make my hair little more rich and thicker</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo...</li>
            <li>I keep coming back to enjoy products</li>
            <li>Unlike the other ENJOY products I have used, this shampoo does not lather well plus seems to make my scalp itch a bit -- UCK!  </li>
            <li>My husband is alllergic to 46 different airborne things, so a shampoo that isn&#x27;t too artifically fragrant and can clean all the allergines out of my hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the other product - Enjoy Luxury Shampoo for years and recently purchased the Rejuvenating Volumizing Shampoo to see how my fine hair would do.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>so wash it 2x first time you use it 2nd time</li>
            <li>I have gone through a lot of shampoos in my adult lifetime</li>
            <li>but I went back to using the AG Shampoo yesterday and my hair and scalp now feels absolutely heavenly.</li>
            <li>My hair has body, but it leaves it soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I have excema, on my scalp no less, that causes skin build up.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather as much as others, but feels like it cleans without stripping my long curly hair and makes my scalp tingle.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thick hair and extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Most sulfate-free shampoos either leave too much residue, don&#x27;t clean well enough, smell bad, dry out my skin/hair/scalp, or cause my skin and scalp to break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo for my oily , thin hair</li>
            <li>gives my hair just a little bit of oomph, doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair or skin, doesn&#x27;t leave a residue, smells good (but subtle) and doesn&#x27;t cause itchy redness all over my body.</li>
            <li>I have naturally dirty blonde, fine, straight hair.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;ve found that I only need to condition during really dry weather, and then only once a week.</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s something strange about this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> The luxury shampoo made my hair soft, to the  point it was hard to hold a curl, I would still recommend that product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my hair is not coming out on my comb when I comb through my wet hair as it always did before.  </li>
            <li> so I have to be careful with what I use.</li>
            <li> Other reviews say it doesn&#x27;t lather</li>
            <li> There is a shine to my hair that I never noticed with other shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding this in local stores</li>
            <li> However, for my thin hair, the volumizing product does seem to make my hair not as soft, but definately thicker.</li>
            <li> It gives volume to my thinning hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh  it down.</li>
            <li> Not sure why</li>
            <li> Does the work of an ordinary shampoo</li>
            <li> lately - thank goodness for Amazon!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very hard to maintain.  </li>
            <li> I have a difficult scalp and this shampoo answers all my needs.  </li>

            <li> I love this shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t lather as much as others, but feels like it cleans without stripping my long curly hair and makes my scalp tingle.</li>
            <li> I have gone through a lot of shampoos in my adult lifetime and I have to admit that I did see a difference using this product.  First of all, there is a great deal of it.  I won&#x27;t have to buy shampoo for months.  Other reviews say it doesn&#x27;t lather but mine sure lathered.  I have noticed that my hair is not coming out on my comb when I comb through my wet hair as it always did before.  There is a shine to my hair that I never noticed with other shampoos.  My styling also seems to last longer.  I am truly &amp;#34;ENJOY&amp;#34;ing this shampoo!</li>
            <li> I usually LOVE all ENJOY products but there&#x27;s something strange about this shampoo.  Unlike the other ENJOY products I have used, this shampoo does not lather well plus seems to make my scalp itch a bit -- UCK!  Not sure why but I went back to using the AG Shampoo yesterday and my hair and scalp now feels absolutely heavenly.</li>

            <li> Use this product all the time, love it!</li>
            <li> Great product. Make my hair little more rich and thicker</li>
            <li> Awesome product I love it makes my hair healthy and clean and I do lots of things to damage my hair. I&#x27;m in love and wont stop til I cant find it. Was turned on by my favorite stylist. 1st use your hair wont sud so wash it 2x first time you use it 2nd time it suds and from then on will sud unless u stop using for a while.  I love the smell and texture everything about it.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo...it works well for oily hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid fan of this shampoo.ive been using it for a while. It gives volume to my thinning hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh  it down.</li>
            <li> I have a difficult scalp and this shampoo answers all my needs.  I have excema, on my scalp no less, that causes skin build up. I have naturally dirty blonde, fine, straight hair.  This shampoo massages my scalp, removes skin buildup, removes dust, dirt, and allergines from my hair, all while keeping my hair shiny and fresh.  I only have to use conditioner sparingly, as-needed.  It also has a nice healing ecalyptus smell to it. My husband is alllergic to 46 different airborne things, so a shampoo that isn&#x27;t too artifically fragrant and can clean all the allergines out of my hair (hair is said to hold the largest quality of allegines in the bed) is a winner and this is that winner.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is fantastic. I was concerned that it would not add the volume I wanted, but it does. Great to find a shampoo that is sulfate free, but has the other properties I want. Smells good, too!</li>
            <li> Only shampoo my daughter can use.  Love it</li>
            <li> Best shampoo I have ever used. My hair has body, but it leaves it soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo for my oily , thin hair</li>
            <li> Enjoy lover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the tingly feeling this gives to my hai . I have thinner hair so I have to be careful with what I use. I keep coming back to enjoy products</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Nothing special for its price. Does the work of an ordinary shampoo</li>
            <li> This is the only sulfate free shampoo (of the many I&#x27;ve tried) that meets all of my criteria. I have fine, thick hair and extremely sensitive skin. Most sulfate-free shampoos either leave too much residue, don&#x27;t clean well enough, smell bad, dry out my skin/hair/scalp, or cause my skin and scalp to break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gives my hair just a little bit of oomph, doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair or skin, doesn&#x27;t leave a residue, smells good (but subtle) and doesn&#x27;t cause itchy redness all over my body.

            <li> I purchased this Shampoo for several reason but the most important is it was rated very good on the EWG.org website that gives details and ratings to personal care products and their levels of toxic ingredients. It gets my hair very clean and i am not worried about having toxicity penetrate through my scalp. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very nice for removing product for fine hair</li>
            <li> I color my hair red and it&#x27;s very hard to maintain.  Enjoy helps me maintain my color and keep my hair looking healthy.</li>
            <li> Item was perfect and delivered quickly!  Very happy with everything!</li>
