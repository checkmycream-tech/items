            <li>When Mom&#x27;s happy everyone&#x27;s happy.</li>
            <li>This is good stuff.</li>
            <li>TYheorder arrived as promised and in good shape.  </li>
            <li>This product is full of undesirable ingredients including carcinogenic preservative BHT!!!  </li>
            <li>I really love it!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t break me out, which is amazing.</li>
            <li>I used it years ago and was happy to see that it is still available.  </li>
            <li>I am so loving this.</li>
            <li>It is nice when you can find something that works as well, or better, than you were looking for.</li>
            <li>Very secure.</li>
            <li>I find Glycerin Rose Water to be the best treatment for my dry hands.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and the packaging was great.  </li>
            <li>It works better than sesame oil.</li>
            <li>Therefore having to purchase more of&lt;br /&gt;the product sooner.  </li>
            <li>This specific product has worked wonderfully well</li>
            <li>I was pleased to find that I could purchase this product on line.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot find it in drugstores anymore.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love glycerin and rose water - so great for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>product is good quality and reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I was able to find such a good deal.  </li>
            <li>and I liked &#x27;the smell so much</li>
            <li>Great facial astringent.  </li>
            <li>Would absolutely recommend this to anyone that has combination or dry skin great stuff!</li>
            <li>I am glad that I was able to purchase it through Amazon.com, since my regular supplier went out of business.</li>
            <li>She uses it everyday and feels great.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth purchasing.</li>
            <li>I bought an 8oz spray bottle for it, but it would have been far better to have</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this fine product to anyone of your customers.</li>
            <li>I use it constantly and especially right</li>
            <li>My skin now feels very soft and smooth the way skin should feel.  </li>
            <li>a facial mist spray top come with it.  </li>
            <li>Skin is always so soft &amp; smooth when using this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>How safe can you get other than something you put in your eyes, ingest it as a mild laxative.  </li>
            <li>do not pour it straight from the bottle.</li>
            <li>However, it comes without a spray top, which makes it difficult to use appropriately.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not easy to find since Walgreens stopped stocking their house brand many years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I get my extremely sensitive skin from my mother&#x27;s side of the family.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s affordable and seems to have natural ingredients in it.</li>
            <li>No alcohol, natural, humectant, not greasy, glycerin is in toothpaste, mouthwash for drymouth (biotene), compare the price, I wash my face with it, brush my teeth with it, they use glycerin in eye drops.  </li>
            <li>This is the only product that has ever really calmed the irritation.</li>
            <li>Leaves face feeling moist and soft.  </li>
            <li>My other complaint is the fact that it is weak on the Rose and strong on the water.  </li>
            <li>I never net my great-grandmother, but she apparently didn&#x27;t have any wrinkles.</li>

            <li> Wonderful!  My sister gave me a bottle of their product last year and I liked &#x27;the smell so much, I tried to make it last as long as possible. I&#x27;m glad I was able to find such a good deal.  Shipping was fast and the packaging was great.  Very secure.</li>
            <li> I find Glycerin Rose Water to be the best treatment for my dry hands.  I use it constantly and especially right after I wash my hands. I am glad that I was able to purchase it through Amazon.com, since my regular supplier went out of business. I highly recommend this fine product to anyone of your customers.</li>
            <li> I get my extremely sensitive skin from my mother&#x27;s side of the family. One day my mother and I were talking and she said that my great-grandmother used to use glycerin and rosewater. I never net my great-grandmother, but she apparently didn&#x27;t have any wrinkles. I am a 24 year old male and was really skeptical of this stuff would work on my face, but thought I&#x27;d try it given the family history. I really love it! It doesn&#x27;t break me out, which is amazing. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy either. Also, it&#x27;s affordable and seems to have natural ingredients in it. This is good stuff. I think I&#x27;ve finally found a product I can depend on. By the way, I have acne-prone skin and it&#x27;s combination skin (regarding oil).</li>
            <li> No alcohol, natural, humectant, not greasy, glycerin is in toothpaste, mouthwash for drymouth (biotene), compare the price, I wash my face with it, brush my teeth with it, they use glycerin in eye drops.  How safe can you get other than something you put in your eyes, ingest it as a mild laxative.  Read the ingredients in any lotion.....glycerin.</li>
            <li> BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!  This product is full of undesirable ingredients including carcinogenic preservative BHT!!!  I wish I had read the ingredients before purchasing a 6 pack.  I thought I was buying a cheaper alternative to my usual Heritage Store brand, but this stuff is absolute rubbish.  It smells fake and leaves a slimy film all over your skin.</li>
            <li> I have this one spot on my back that is always itchy. This is the only product that has ever really calmed the irritation. It works better than sesame oil. I rub it on my back before I dry off from the shower, and hardly notice the itch all day. I&#x27;ve also used it on the front of my legs after shaving, and it keeps me from developing eczema there during the winter. A must-have in my household.</li>
            <li> Love glycerin and rose water - so great for dry skin.  It&#x27;s not easy to find since Walgreens stopped stocking their house brand many years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is good quality and reasonably priced.  Definitely worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> However, it comes without a spray top, which makes it difficult to use appropriately.  I bought an 8oz spray bottle for it, but it would have been far better to have a facial mist spray top come with it.  I use this after showering and it needs a misting spray.  I will keep looking for one.  My other complaint is the fact that it is weak on the Rose and strong on the water.  Real rose water should be richer than this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s deceptive because I ordered one brand but received another. If you&#x27;re going to advertise a product, that&#x27;s what you should send!</li>
            <li> I use this after showering.  Skin is always so soft &amp; smooth when using this product.&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I think it is the best thing to use on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used raw coconut.  It is in solid form.  Melted down it is an oil. Works well but does&lt;br /&gt;not last as long as the glycerine &amp; rosewater.&lt;br /&gt;I do not pour it straight from the bottle. I put it in a spray bottle and spritz&lt;br /&gt;it on, rub it thru on my entire body. If you pour it from the bottle into your cupped hand, you lose alot of the liquid. Therefore having to purchase more of&lt;br /&gt;the product sooner.  Believe me, 6 bottles lasts a really long time by transferring&lt;br /&gt;it to a spray bottle.</li>
            <li> It is a versatile toner that immediately softens and is a subtle exfoliator.  Daily use morning and nightly use.  I would not be without it.</li>
            <li> TYheorder arrived as promised and in good shape.  I have used this product before and will order again from this supplier when needed.</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;splash\\&quot; is non-greasy yet hydrating. I have received several compliments on the fragrance. I pour the liquid into an empty soap pump to avoid wasting any.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few products my Mother can use on her skin.  This specific product has worked wonderfully well and she ha found it to be the best she has had for some years.  It is nice when you can find something that works as well, or better, than you were looking for.</li>
            <li> Great facial astringent.  Leaves face feeling moist and soft.  Wonderful scent too!</li>
            <li> I was pleased to find that I could purchase this product on line.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot find it in drugstores anymore.</li>
            <li> I am so loving this. Bought the 6 pack, gives my skin the glow. Will buy again when finished.&lt;br /&gt;Nice product</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff. Has a terrific scent and keeps my skin hydrated for long periods of time. Would absolutely recommend this to anyone that has combination or dry skin great stuff!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my mother. She uses it everyday and feels great. When Mom&#x27;s happy everyone&#x27;s happy. Thank you</li>
            <li> I used it years ago and was happy to see that it is still available.  It&#x27;s the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  My skin now feels very soft and smooth the way skin should feel.  Thank you again</li>
