            <li>So, I tried this, and it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>but my skin does feel great.</li>
            <li>This is a great value compared to retail stores.</li>
            <li>Which is great if that&#x27;s what you want.</li>
            <li>Purchased this cream based on the great reviews.</li>
            <li>I love this!!</li>
            <li>It smells very nice, too.</li>
            <li>It really is amazing!  </li>
            <li>I get so many wonderful compliments on my skin</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
            <li>and this is a good replacement.  </li>
            <li>every incredible thing you&#x27;ve heard about Egyptian magic.</li>
            <li>It healed all the redness and peeling within a day and it felt so good that I just kept using it.  </li>
            <li>Good for what ails you.</li>
            <li>Not as good as Egyptian creme, but will do in a pinch.</li>
            <li>Uses after taking a bath or shower so it absorbs good.</li>
            <li>When I wake up my skin looks so good.</li>
            <li>Good to have in the medicine cabinet.  </li>
            <li>This is a good as a day and night moisturizer .</li>
            <li>It felt good, but it did nothing to help heal my rash.  </li>
            <li>price is good value too.</li>
            <li>Good value also.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who wanted a healing cream, with good vibes.</li>
            <li>reviews I read were mostly good, sounded like what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Good cream,</li>
            <li>Smells like honey, but not in a good way.</li>
            <li>and it is really good for your skin.</li>
            <li>Its very smooth and has great healing properties for damaged or torn skin.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more happy.</li>
            <li>My favorite is the honey which contains all kinds of vitamins and enzymes great for skin which might offset the oxidized oil.</li>
            <li>Very light, pleasant, and unobtrusive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture</li>
            <li>I have never been so satisfied with a product ever!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I just had to give Bee Magic 5 stars!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I took the advice!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>but I wish it smelled better!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ve experienced all the amazing healing properties expressed by others, nonetheless it has been good for more challenging skin conditions my kids might have like eczema, etc.</li>
            <li>Its amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing.  </li>
            <li>nice.. product</li>
            <li>I needed a good face cream during chemo while battling breast cancer, so I chose this one after looking at many.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of like Neosporin</li>
            <li>It also has a nice, homey aroma.</li>
            <li>I bought it with Egyptian Magic, can&#x27;t tell the difference, both are good for my skin.</li>
            <li>I get whenever the weather gets warm or a piece of clothing rubs anywhere -  shea and cocoa butters, cortisone gels, steroid creams, you name it.</li>
            <li>The steroid creams have worked best, but who wants to keep using those?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad these guys came along and competed with the Egyptian Magic because the price war means consumers win.</li>
            <li>Egyptian Magic is paler, maybe a bit waxier, and just isn&#x27;t as good, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>My main cause for wearing makeup is to even out my skin tone and with this product I feel beautiful without make up!</li>
            <li>This is a nice organic moisturizer, I use it mostly on my face, hands and elbows.</li>
            <li>My skin looks soft and flawless!</li>
            <li>I give it 4 stars which is near perfect.</li>
            <li>I liked it a lot, did what Egyptian Magic did.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After reading the great reviews for Sweet Bee Magic Skin Cream, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li>Sweet Bee to the rescue!!  </li>
            <li>Great product -- I&#x27;ve tried to make this myself but haven&#x27;t quite gotten the formula right</li>
            <li>I will order more when I am out of it</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t find more use for it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love and I will keep buying this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not wasting a ton of money or time in the stores looking for any more hopeful fixes.</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels almost Skin</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I found it.</li>
            <li>I love love love this</li>
            <li>I went through so many hormonal changes with my cancer medications</li>
            <li>Smells great and really helps my skin.</li>
            <li>So much better than Egyptian  magic.</li>
            <li>Organic ingredients make this a better value...</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>I think my skin is looking positively better</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love the look and feel of skin after use.</li>
            <li>than the doctor prescribed medication, being confined o bed or chair any thing giving more comfort</li>
            <li>It works just as well as Egyptian Magic</li>
            <li>While this product sounds great and I am sure if you bought it in store (it&#x27;s sold in Whole Foods</li>
            <li>for those who bought into magic of bee pollen &amp; royal jelly.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>but it has a tad more wax.  </li>
            <li>But if you put more than a dab on, you look greasy, like people on TV with a lot of makeup.</li>
            <li>The difference between this product and EM is this one appears softer, ie there&#x27;s probably more wax in the Egyptian Magic.  </li>
            <li>Although that means it&#x27;s probably better ingredient-wise</li>
            <li>Okay so let me tell you why you should not go another day without this.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this cream.  </li>
            <li>My kids love to eat it</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve made one mama and one (formerly) itchy boy very happy!</li>
            <li>I prefer Egyptian magic over this brand.  </li>
            <li>Egyptian is better to put on the face and hands because it does not bleed.  </li>
            <li>Bee Magic is ok for the rest of your body.  </li>
            <li>I would not recommend using Bee Magic at night because it will bleed onto your bed spread or and</li>
            <li>Wonderful facial cream!</li>
            <li>Cheaper than Egyptian Magic and works just as well.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t magic.  </li>
            <li>Then, I take a paper towel and dab off the excess sitting on top of my skin.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Within 2 weeks of using Bee Magic I&#x27;m tossing all my spot correctors out the door.</li>
            <li>Pros: Resolved many misc.</li>
            <li>My family has used this successfully on many skin issues.</li>
            <li>I purchased Bee Magic skin cream based on the reviews...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad that</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Egyptian magic cream until I saw a review from Amazon recommending Bee Magic instead.</li>
            <li>When I pressed my finger in (I used some strength because you have to do that with Egyptian magic cream), my finger caused a dent the cream almost immediately.</li>
            <li>is more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Incidentally, the ingredient list for Egyptian Magic are:&lt;br /&gt;Olive Oil, Beeswax, Honey, Bee Pollen, Royal Jelly and Propolis extract.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>Incidentally, the ingredient list for Egyptian Magic are:  Olive Oil, Beeswax, Honey, Bee Pollen, Royal Jelly and Propolis extract.  </li>
            <li>Many of the red&lt;</li>
            <li>We have tried so many things over the years.  </li>
            <li>Definitely more medicinal than an every day lotion.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this cream to compare it to Egyptian Magic.</li>
            <li>My wife loves this a bit more than magic cream.</li>
            <li>I tried this product after seeing it compared to Egyptian Magic.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Sweeter and fresher honey fragrance (versus Egyptian Magic)...</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s organic (Egyptian Magic isn&#x27;t)...</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It is everything it claims to be and more.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t scoop any out, just run my fingertip around on top and dab wherever I need moisture.  </li>
            <li>Until this magic in a jar.</li>
            <li>Bought this because i wanted an organic version of Egyptian Magic</li>
            <li>It has a distinctive odor, but so does egyptian magic.</li>
            <li>I tried Egyptian Magic</li>
            <li>I love this as a winter night cream.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t bother either of my sons, and I&#x27;m even able to put it on their faces.  </li>
            <li>I do love that it doesn&#x27;t have added fragrance (which makes some people think that the product is rancid).</li>
            <li>I found egyptian magic on pinterest and people were raving about it.</li>
            <li>I really think this is a great investment for beauty.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is magic</li>
            <li>One SB and then the slightly better EM.</li>
            <li>OK, so I know everyone raves about Egyptian Magic, but I&#x27;ve tried both, and I like Medicine Mama&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li>It seems to be more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>If you have ever tried Egyptian magic you will love this.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>using Bee Magic</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I suggest that you guys buy it :]</li>
            <li>This product is a very rich oily product.  </li>
            <li>more, more easily so watch your application amount.  </li>
            <li>After reading all of the great reviews,  I was pretty excited about trying this product.  </li>
            <li>At first, I was put off because it doesn&#x27;t smell good.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;ll be excellent for the skin in the dry winter.</li>
            <li>I originally went online to buy Egyptian Magic but the reviews brought me over to Bee Magic.  </li>
            <li>But since I was excited to try, I tried Bee Magic on my hands and my skin seem to love it.</li>
            <li>that he&#x27;s becoming self-conscious about.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you, Amazon for carrying this product and thank you Sweet Blessed Bee Magic for your fantastic product!  </li>
            <li>I really never thought this would work like this, but my skin is the best it&#x27;s ever been.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more of a lightly greasy ointment.</li>
            <li>You can always add more if you feel your first application wasn&#x27;t effective</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t feel that much difference between it and good moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li>, I heard this bee magic was almost identical with a bonus on being budget friendly.</li>
            <li>When I have blemishes, it helps heal them very quickly.</li>
            <li>Easily absorbed&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Absorbs easily.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good, all natural product with many uses.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d leave the house looking great, but by 2 PM there would be &amp;#34;islands&amp;#34; of makeup on my face where the makeup had managed to accumulate, leaving the rest of my face bare.  </li>
            <li>and I contribute it to Sweet Blessed Bee Magic.</li>
            <li>Tried Sweet Bee and the Egyptian Magic and neither of them have any benefits for my skin.</li>
            <li>It is oily but very good for her dry skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Bee Magic, it is amazing.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a decrease in any discoloration or scars on my skin, but it certainly is helping me keep my skin healthy!</li>
            <li>Seems to diminish the look of fine lines.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what it says it is, Sweet BLESSED Bee Magic!</li>
            <li>My son had huge patches of puffy, itchy eczema</li>
            <li>This has been a huge help for my lips and is a great facial moisturizer!</li>
            <li>I believe) it would be a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin look smoother and more colorful.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth, even-toned and glowing.</li>
            <li>I apply this lightly all over my face and neck and allow to absorb.</li>
            <li>and my skin is back to feeling and looking great.</li>
            <li>my skin smooth</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>It is so smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fabulous and worth the money for sure.  </li>
            <li>I had tried everything - I even used proactive for a couple of months right before this (i just ran out) and this cream worked BETTER than proactive...</li>
            <li>you can apply to this beautiful little product here, bee magic :D.  </li>
            <li>Not thick but light and effective.</li>
            <li>but as far as a moisturizer it works exceptionally well.</li>
            <li>me, this truly is a MAGIC cream because it really works!  </li>
            <li>I like it but do not see the significant improvements of skin as described by some others.</li>
            <li>first I did some research and came across a comment about the Bee Magic cream.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s significantly cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I wipe it clean and put some of this stuff on</li>
            <li>I just received my Sweet Blessed Bee Magic today and used it for the first time following a calcium benotite clay mask - my skin feels amazing - smooth, supple, and luscious!</li>
            <li>I love how bee magic is already soft.</li>
            <li>The product isa great moisturizer for dry skin.</li>
            <li>No chemicals to worry about either, which is super important to me…your skin is your largest organ and anything you put on it</li>
            <li>It is pricey, but it is full of beneficially ingredients I believe to be totally worth it!</li>
            <li>oh wow I love it!</li>
            <li>The Sweet Bee Magic cream is, by far, my favorite.</li>
            <li>I am really surprised and don&#x27;t plan on stopping using this Bee Magic!</li>
            <li>Works great on zits as well... softens them right up and takes out the red.</li>
            <li>and this is great for dry skin!  </li>
            <li>My skin is dull on my best day..</li>
            <li>I chose this product because of it&#x27;s organic production and apparent similarity to Egyptian Magic which I&#x27;ve used for many years.  </li>
            <li>This is great stuff for the rough spots on your body.  </li>
            <li>but I love this stuff so much.</li>
            <li>I love it so much that I bought two jars for my mom.</li>
            <li>and I applied Sweet Bee on them after his bath while he was still damp.  </li>
            <li>the cream is VERY greasy, and seems to stay on top of my skin.</li>
            <li>I tried it on an itchy spot that was about to become a full fledged rash.</li>
            <li>Magic is really magic!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than egyptian magic too.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>The Bee Magic felt good, but so did shea butter and cocoa butter, so it really wasn&#x27;t worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li>This is pure and natural and feels good</li>
            <li>but if anyone here wants to suggest a better makeup for use over this, I&#x27;d certainly be willing to listen!</li>
            <li>My boyfriend and his friend was swearing I was pregnant....</li>
            <li>Was super greasy and did not sink in.  </li>
            <li>I was using a mild soap with Donkey Milk which also gave me some relief</li>
            <li>I opened up Bee Magic, it smelled and looked the same as the Egyptian magic cream (EMC).</li>
            <li>The product itself is has a creamy consistency when removed from the jar and quickly melts from the warmth of your hands.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin with mild acne and rosacea.</li>
            <li>This seller also shipped quickly, I&#x27;d recommend both this product and the seller.</li>
            <li>I have very oily, fair, sensitive, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>Where I work I sell the other, more popular, version of this cream, but I was hoping that I could make an organic version myself.</li>
            <li>Unlike egyptian magic which doesn&#x27;t do organic and then have this explanation that says they don&#x27;t because they find some organic products are poorer quality than the normal  ingredients.</li>
            <li>Sometimes scrunch a bit in my hair, it&#x27;s good on dry feet, hands, elbows, basically anywhere.  </li>
            <li>I had tried Egyptian Magic in the past but somehow it never gave me results this good.</li>
            <li>I was a long term user of Egyptian Magic and switched to this in November 2012 after reading many favorable reviews.  </li>
            <li>Very greasy, but great for elbows, and extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Its ingredients are pure and you won&#x27;t have to worry about breaking out, although I&#x27;m sure the oily consistency may scare some people with very acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>It may seem oily when you apply it, but it does get absorbed if you don&#x27;t glom it on.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love that it&#x27;s organic and all natural.</li>
            <li>My own personal experiences with continued use have been positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every cent.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>My sons have eczema, and many of the lotions -- even those marked specifically for eczema -- burn them.  </li>
            <li>I love knowing it&#x27;s natural.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;For what it is worth, I am allergic to bee stings and I have not had any adverse reactions to this product.</li>
            <li>In this age we wash and dry all the beautiful natural oil in our hair</li>
            <li>Works pretty good on my dry hands, however, it&#x27;s too greasy to put on your face, gets in your hair.....</li>
            <li>and it seems to absorb pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I am delighted to have found this, and I concur with all of the other rave reviews here.  </li>
            <li>only it&#x27;s natural and full of good things.   </li>
            <li>Hey, this stuff really lasts, regardless of how I use it, so I might as well get my money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li>However i found for the price and overall effect of this so called magic cream to be nothing special.  </li>
            <li>This took the itch/sting right out.</li>
            <li>It is greasy, but we put it on right after bath time before bed</li>
            <li>I know the positive quality of bee pollen and royal jelly!</li>
            <li>I bought a jar of Sweet Blessed Bee Magic from a local health food store and have been putting it all over my face, legs, and hands.</li>
            <li>Medicine Mama&#x27;s Apothecary Sweet Blessed Bee Magic Cream is the only product that has worked for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s excellent on dry cuticles and very dry heels.  </li>
            <li>Bee Magic is more  like Petroleum Jelly and has a slightly stronger odor.&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li>skin, i.e. on freshly scrubbed, immediately after a hot bath.</li>
            <li>I got this originally because it was compared to Egyptian Magic which I really wanted to try because I watch a lot of tutorials on YouTube and its the big rage</li>
            <li>Very greasy feeling, but it soaks in fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>Also, you don&#x27;t need to use very much.</li>
            <li>The shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>This was recommended and much to my shock, it worked immediately!</li>
            <li>This cream can be used practically anywhere on the body and it absorbs in pretty well.</li>
            <li>First of all, I never write reviews for anything</li>
            <li>I have struggled with breakouts and problematic oily skin most of my life, and this is the only thing that I can say makes a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>dollars for \\&quot;Egyptian magic\\&quot; cream when this product has the EXACT same ingredients list buts its way more affordable.  </li>
            <li>Really!  </li>
            <li>After washing my face, it leaves it smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>So 3 starts for me, but it could get more from someone with a different skin type..</li>
            <li>It is creamer and more solid.  </li>
            <li>I have used Egyptian Magic prior</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;It spreads very well on my skin!</li>
            <li>No such issue with Bee Magic.</li>
            <li>As a personal note, I have also used Egyptian Magic.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>Will buy more, and my skin looks much younger.</li>
            <li>It soaks in within seconds and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily, just soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li>This product really clogged my pores!  </li>
            <li>We will buy more when this is gone, although I expect it to last a while.</li>
            <li>First, let me tell you that I abuse my face.</li>
            <li>It is intimidating how greasy it looks at first, but it does soak into your skin after 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>and it reeks of rancid olive oil (unlike the first bottle).  </li>
            <li>After the next use, the dry patches were becoming softer and smoother, and best of all - the blemishes were clearing and no new spots!&lt;br /&gt;Today - just 6 days after first use of the cream - my face is completely healed.</li>
            <li>It is a bit greasy (the main ingredient is Olive oil), but once it is applied to the skin, it is absorbed within 5-10 min and skin no longer feels oily.</li>
            <li>container should last for many applications (depending on how much of your body on which you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be aware that in warm weather, you might be chased by a swarm of bees or other insects!</li>
            <li>My raw, chapped nose and lips looked and felt so much better so quickly!</li>
            <li>I drink way to much coffee,not enough water and on top of it I have large pores along with combination skin.</li>
            <li>I think shea butter and cocoa butter are just as good, so I am not able to recommend this product at this price.  </li>
            <li>: creamy and soft but on the mildly oily side as it contains organic olive and fruit oil.</li>
            <li>I was happy though that I had gotten my acne down to the point where I only had one zit at a time.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a cheaper alternative to L&#x27;Occitane&#x27;s pure Shea butter &amp; tried this product.</li>
            <li>It instantly smooths out fine lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine that I can only use the cream at night</li>
            <li>The creme healed little problem areas and really does a nice job of hydrating and softening your skin.  </li>
            <li>I think EM is a little better on the quality if i had to choose but neither of them are worth buying to me.</li>
            <li>This creme is very versatile.  </li>
            <li>It works and it works VERY WELL.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to hype it too much, but if you are on the fence, just try it.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>it really work my son eczema on his body, recommended</li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>Just like the name, it&#x27;s really a blessing to have.</li>
            <li>I wash my face and apply the cream before bed, and then in the morning my skin is ready to go for the day.</li>
            <li>Just very moisturizing and fullens.     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had cystic acne for over twenty years and have really tried everything.  </li>
            <li>My only concern is the price, I started to order more and the price is ten dollars more than last time.</li>
            <li>Egyptian magic is a thicker harder consistency.</li>
            <li>isn&#x27;t really meant to absorb - so it can sit on skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>never use my EMC during the day because it&#x27;s sticky and my skin doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb it very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Application: I&#x27;ve applied this to various, non-serious wounds, scars, as a moisturizer for face and body, and applied lightly to my hair.</li>
            <li>had a harder texture and smelled more &#x27;industrial&#x27; like petroleum type.y</li>
            <li>The EM had a harder texture and smelled more &#x27;industrial&#x27; like petroleum type.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;this very problematic acne.  </li>
            <li>I am very grateful we found it.</li>
            <li>Really softens my skin.  </li>
            <li>Definitely keeps the skin moisturized and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It does have an aroma, not pungent, just earthy and very mellow.  </li>
            <li>I have tried pulling the skin off, exfoliating, lots of lotions, potions, oils, and even straight vitamin E 70,000</li>
            <li>iu, nothing really worked.</li>
            <li>I finally feel comfortable in my skin in over 2 years.</li>
            <li>A very soothing and healing cream.</li>
            <li>But the product is very sticky, and does not absorb into my skin.</li>
            <li>olive oil works just as well and is so much cheaper.</li>
            <li>only use it at night or when I have free time at home&lt;br /&gt;Greasy</li>
            <li>I found a recipe online where you can make something very similiar with olive oil, beeswax and coconut oil for alot cheaper.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product if you dont mind spending so much for 4oz</li>
            <li>I know when someone wants to try it, they will.</li>
            <li>really recommend it also for the feet.&lt;br /&gt;Bee</li>
            <li>I feels kind of heavy</li>
            <li>Love the simple, natural combination of ingredients.</li>
            <li>skin issues in the family (razor burn, dry skin, allergic rash, children&#x27;s skin problems, etc), smells nice, a little goes far, clean non-toxic product, better price than major competitor.</li>
            <li>His dry patches have improved and his skin is becoming softer and conditioned.</li>
            <li>I own other products that are all natural and made with olive oil</li>
            <li>My hair looks, full, shiny, never dry and never greasy.  </li>
            <li>Other reviews have said it has a \\&quot;sweet honey smell\\&quot; and I don&#x27;t find that to be true at all.</li>
            <li>I found my Bee Magic and gently coated his arms with it and very carefully put some on his face.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs easily.&lt;br /&gt;Terrific for re-hydrating those dry cuticles on fingers and toes, good prevention from dry, cracked heels when used daily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I always look for a rich but absorbable cream during winter in mid west.&lt;br /&gt;Till</li>
            <li>I went to whole foods initially to buy the Egyptian Magic and next to it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Clinique Dark Spot Corrector and a Dr. prescription for my acne scars before using Bee Magic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Scent: Definitely of bee origins, like a sweet honey.</li>
            <li>It has already reduced the raised scar under my arm significantly in two weeks, my face is so much softer and I see it helping with the dry winter skin and my under eye circles, and even chapped lips.  </li>
            <li>Use a new clean swab, spatula, or popsicle stick when going in for a second helping.</li>
            <li>my legs and feet have serious circulation and potential bed sore problems, this bee magic is more soothing and&lt;br /&gt;healing</li>
            <li>Bee magic goes on your skin rather oily, but my skin has become DRASTICALLY less oily since using the product.</li>
            <li>use this mainly at night on my face and in the day on my legs</li>
            <li>and they are starting to improve tremendously after using it.</li>
            <li>I bought Bee Magic a few months ago but hadn&#x27;t really used it yet.  </li>
            <li>The main ingrediant is olive oil</li>
            <li>Use this just before bed, wake up soon feeling very smooth, and yes a little died go along way</li>
            <li>Its really soothing on my very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My skin feels so very soft after using for just a week!</li>
            <li>Still, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for all.</li>
            <li>Dry ends and mild frizz are almost a memory until the very end of the day.</li>
            <li>Dry ends and mild frizz are almost a memory until the very end of the day.</li>
            <li>Nothing has really resolved my issue completely.</li>
            <li>It has really helped clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>and this really makes their skin soft.</li>
            <li>It smell stays on my skin for a long time, going back to Egyptian Magic.</li>
            <li>This cleared up perpetually dry skin  - meaning it was used for a week and a month later the skin is still healthy.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing - in a couple hours it&#x27;s usually gone!  </li>
            <li>I have had wayyy better results using plain ol&#x27; Vaseline.</li>
            <li>I have combo/oily skin, and right now it is 95 degrees outside</li>
            <li>a hair conditioner/pomade--&lt;br /&gt;Results vary, but on coarse long locks--when lightly applied, does really well.</li>
            <li>Results vary, but on coarse long locks--when lightly applied, does really well.</li>
            <li>For the past couple of weeks, I&#x27;ve been using it as a daily body moisturizer after my morning shower, and so far, so good.</li>
            <li>I only get the tiniest pimples occasionally now and they clear up super fast!</li>
            <li>I will try it in the morning with an SPF lotion made specifically for facial skin and see how that works out, but even if you only use it as a night moisturizer, it is fantastic with no overpowering chemicals or fragrances.</li>
            <li>and I can review again later to tell you if that really works because that&#x27;ll really be a miracle.</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a pretty long way with this stuff, but I love smothering it all over my face.</li>
            <li>I put some on the first night and noticed the difference the next day.</li>
            <li>steroid creams and only one consistently helps.  </li>
            <li>I tried using the bare minimum of the stuff and rubbing it in really well.  </li>
            <li>I paid $21 and usually pay about $30 for Egyptian Magic.</li>
            <li>It works out pretty well for my facial skin.</li>
            <li>Apply to barely damp skin, and rub it in very well.</li>
            <li>it came early in the mail!</li>
            <li>I bought a Clarisonic (love) and started using Sweet Bee Cream at night, and adding 2 drops of Dr. Hauschka Normalizing Day Oil to my moisturizer every morning (it is a bit expensive, but 6 months in -</li>
            <li>It smells faintly like olive oil and honey which I find pleasant</li>
            <li>Terrific for re-hydrating those dry cuticles on fingers and toes, good prevention from dry, cracked heels when used daily.    </li>
            <li>Only negative is that flies and insects love it, including bees!</li>
            <li>I dutifully kept using toners, acids, and anything drying to try and clear it up.  </li>
            <li>to clear oil?  </li>
            <li>I think these are showing up primarily because he isn&#x27;t careful enough in cleansing.  </li>
            <li>For years I have been trying to find a product that keeps my skin clear and helps clear up the breakouts I do have</li>
            <li>I was in a Natural Foods market and asked for a recommendation for a product that would help with my eczema.</li>
            <li>It is working wonders for my sons eczema and is natural and organic.</li>
            <li>I am in my early 30s with combination/ sensitive skin with acne problems.</li>
            <li>he&#x27;s been alive and we&#x27;ve tried 18+</li>
            <li>My 12-year old grandson went to some car races yesterday and was scheduled to spend the night.  </li>
            <li>Naturally, this eliminates the majority of beauty products on the market.  </li>
            <li>At the age of 30-something, it was unexpected and came out of nowhere.  </li>
            <li>One day, while chatting with my hair stylist - said that I needed to stop stripping my face of its natural oil.  </li>
            <li>Sensitive skin is soothed and does not react to this badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been reading online and thought I might have developed rosacea.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>The cream is so much softer, which leads to the next point ...&lt;</li>
            <li>But with EMC, I need to really put in effort to spread it properly across my skin.</li>
            <li>jelly.&lt;br /&gt;Bonus: it&#x27;s all natural ingredients, nothing artificial.&lt;br /&gt;Less</li>
            <li>Hair is most vulnerable when wet and is better to comb, brush, or pick through when drier.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hair is most vulnerable when wet and is better to comb, brush, or pick through when drier.    </li>
            <li>…that&#x27;s why I like natural products.  </li>
            <li>It heals, protects, and keeps everything soft.</li>
            <li>This product works very well for hand and body; however after putting it on my facial skin for 2-3 days, my face broke out like a teenager!!  </li>
            <li>It made my skin feel so soft and it cleared my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is softer, clearer, and even some old scarring is fading away.</li>
            <li>It smells like slightly old olive oil.</li>
            <li>Even though it looks like a thick Vaseline and is greasy at first, it absorbs really quickly and does not cause me to break out.</li>
            <li>Another is if you rub it on your lips it gives your lips a slightly fuller look which I do find to be kinda true</li>
            <li>Natural ingredients, soaks in well after shower, (a little goes a long way),  I mostly use it on my face and neck and am experimenting using it on the tips of my flyaway hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>have a very dry skin all over my body but especially on my feet, I put Bee Magic on my feet and all cracked and dry skin on my feet is gone!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It has a slight honey waxy smell, not unpleasant, natural smelling.  </li>
            <li>I still like the product for hands, heels, etc, but I would highly discourage others from using it as a facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>wounds have healed relatively quickly and with little or no scarring.</li>
            <li>Any product containing royal jelly &amp; propolis is good for you, provided it&#x27;s all natural with no parabens, pthalates or other unhealthy ingredients.</li>
            <li>it is heavier than a cream and really helps with dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have chronically dry skin and chapped peeling lips despite how much water I drink.</li>
            <li>It is nice to know that the ingredients are all natural and organic, but it would be difficult to use as a day moisturizer since it contains no SPF.</li>
            <li>His face was quite burned from sitting in bleachers in the hot sun, especially around the cheeks, nose and forehead, and his lower arms where his short sleeved T-shirt left off, even after having applied sunscreen before the races.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not strong at all and fades quickly after application.</li>
            <li>important note: a little of this stuff goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li>I definitely got a large cyst with every period and strangely enough a giant cyst every time it snowed.  </li>
            <li>Its consistency turns into an oil pretty much but this means you hardly have to use any.</li>
            <li>Within a matter of 3 weeks I went from having smooth, even skin to having dry, tight, flaky patches and breakouts.</li>
            <li>When oil oxidizes it creates free radicals and I am not sure what this does to the outside of the skin.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would function similar to lush&#x27;s ultrabland</li>
            <li>After that I was using a primer under Bare Minerals makeup.  </li>
            <li>I would use it again, but not at the big price that is charged for it, although I felt comforted knowing how natural it is.</li>
            <li>Take a few minutes and lie on a towel until it is absorbed.</li>
            <li>It is amazing, the smell is a little different, but not strong at all.</li>
            <li>My skin is brighter, less oily, more firm, pores are smaller and it helped clear up my acne.</li>
            <li>My order was received sooner than expected, and my second order even came with cute little samples!</li>
            <li>I only use natural products on my skin because I have topical and hormonal sensitivities to silicones and mineral oil/petroleum jelly.  </li>
            <li>and he has very sensitive skin that gets dry and flaky and rashy</li>
            <li>I live in AZ where it&#x27;s very dry</li>
            <li>This excellent paste got me through this year&#x27;s famously bad Massachusetts winter without the usual cracked skin on my fingers.  </li>
            <li>This is creamier and makes my skin very soft after it sinks in.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried alot of things over the years, this has completely cleared up my acne and dry skin!  </li>
            <li>The actual product in the container has a smooth surface, but a little cracking type texture in one area as if it may have dried out a bit.  </li>

            <li> but my skin does feel great.</li>
            <li> This is a great value compared to retail stores.</li>
            <li> Which is great if that&#x27;s what you want.</li>
            <li> Purchased this cream based on the great reviews.</li>
            <li> I love this!!</li>
            <li> It smells very nice, too.</li>
            <li> It really is amazing!  </li>
            <li> I get so many wonderful compliments on my skin</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
            <li> and this is a good replacement.  </li>
            <li> every incredible thing you&#x27;ve heard about Egyptian magic.</li>
            <li> It healed all the redness and peeling within a day and it felt so good that I just kept using it.  </li>
            <li> Good for what ails you.</li>
            <li> Not as good as Egyptian creme, but will do in a pinch.</li>
            <li> Uses after taking a bath or shower so it absorbs good.</li>
            <li> When I wake up my skin looks so good.</li>
            <li> Good to have in the medicine cabinet.  </li>
            <li> This is a good as a day and night moisturizer .</li>
            <li> It felt good, but it did nothing to help heal my rash.  </li>
            <li> price is good value too.</li>
            <li> Good value also.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who wanted a healing cream, with good vibes.</li>
            <li> reviews I read were mostly good, sounded like what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Good cream,</li>
            <li> Smells like honey, but not in a good way.</li>
            <li> and it is really good for your skin.</li>
            <li> Its very smooth and has great healing properties for damaged or torn skin.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more happy.</li>
            <li> My favorite is the honey which contains all kinds of vitamins and enzymes great for skin which might offset the oxidized oil.</li>
            <li> Very light, pleasant, and unobtrusive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture</li>
            <li> I have never been so satisfied with a product ever!  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> I just had to give Bee Magic 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I took the advice!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> but I wish it smelled better!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ve experienced all the amazing healing properties expressed by others, nonetheless it has been good for more challenging skin conditions my kids might have like eczema, etc.</li>
            <li> Its amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing.  </li>
            <li> nice.. product</li>
            <li> I needed a good face cream during chemo while battling breast cancer, so I chose this one after looking at many.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of like Neosporin</li>
            <li> It also has a nice, homey aroma.</li>
            <li> I bought it with Egyptian Magic, can&#x27;t tell the difference, both are good for my skin.</li>
            <li> I get whenever the weather gets warm or a piece of clothing rubs anywhere -  shea and cocoa butters, cortisone gels, steroid creams, you name it.</li>
            <li> The steroid creams have worked best, but who wants to keep using those?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad these guys came along and competed with the Egyptian Magic because the price war means consumers win.</li>
            <li> Egyptian Magic is paler, maybe a bit waxier, and just isn&#x27;t as good, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> My main cause for wearing makeup is to even out my skin tone and with this product I feel beautiful without make up!</li>
            <li> This is a nice organic moisturizer, I use it mostly on my face, hands and elbows.</li>
            <li> My skin looks soft and flawless!</li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars which is near perfect.</li>
            <li> I liked it a lot, did what Egyptian Magic did.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After reading the great reviews for Sweet Bee Magic Skin Cream, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> Sweet Bee to the rescue!!  </li>
            <li> Great product -- I&#x27;ve tried to make this myself but haven&#x27;t quite gotten the formula right</li>
            <li> I will order more when I am out of it</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t find more use for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love and I will keep buying this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not wasting a ton of money or time in the stores looking for any more hopeful fixes.</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels almost Skin</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I found it.</li>
            <li> I love love love this</li>
            <li> I went through so many hormonal changes with my cancer medications</li>
            <li> Smells great and really helps my skin.</li>
            <li> So much better than Egyptian  magic.</li>
            <li> Organic ingredients make this a better value...</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> I think my skin is looking positively better</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love the look and feel of skin after use.</li>
            <li> than the doctor prescribed medication, being confined o bed or chair any thing giving more comfort</li>
            <li> It works just as well as Egyptian Magic</li>
            <li> While this product sounds great and I am sure if you bought it in store (it&#x27;s sold in Whole Foods</li>
            <li> for those who bought into magic of bee pollen &amp; royal jelly.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> but it has a tad more wax.  </li>
            <li> But if you put more than a dab on, you look greasy, like people on TV with a lot of makeup.</li>
            <li> The difference between this product and EM is this one appears softer, ie there&#x27;s probably more wax in the Egyptian Magic.  </li>
            <li> Although that means it&#x27;s probably better ingredient-wise</li>
            <li> Okay so let me tell you why you should not go another day without this.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love this.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this cream.  </li>
            <li> My kids love to eat it</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve made one mama and one (formerly) itchy boy very happy!</li>
            <li> I prefer Egyptian magic over this brand.  </li>
            <li> Egyptian is better to put on the face and hands because it does not bleed.  </li>
            <li> Bee Magic is ok for the rest of your body.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend using Bee Magic at night because it will bleed onto your bed spread or and</li>
            <li> Wonderful facial cream!</li>
            <li> Cheaper than Egyptian Magic and works just as well.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t magic.  </li>
            <li> Then, I take a paper towel and dab off the excess sitting on top of my skin.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Within 2 weeks of using Bee Magic I&#x27;m tossing all my spot correctors out the door.</li>
            <li> Pros: Resolved many misc.</li>
            <li> My family has used this successfully on many skin issues.</li>
            <li> I purchased Bee Magic skin cream based on the reviews...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Egyptian magic cream until I saw a review from Amazon recommending Bee Magic instead.</li>
            <li> When I pressed my finger in (I used some strength because you have to do that with Egyptian magic cream), my finger caused a dent the cream almost immediately.</li>
            <li> is more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Incidentally, the ingredient list for Egyptian Magic are:&lt;br /&gt;Olive Oil, Beeswax, Honey, Bee Pollen, Royal Jelly and Propolis extract.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> Incidentally, the ingredient list for Egyptian Magic are:  Olive Oil, Beeswax, Honey, Bee Pollen, Royal Jelly and Propolis extract.  </li>
            <li> Many of the red&lt;</li>
            <li> We have tried so many things over the years.  </li>
            <li> Definitely more medicinal than an every day lotion.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this cream to compare it to Egyptian Magic.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this a bit more than magic cream.</li>
            <li> I tried this product after seeing it compared to Egyptian Magic.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> Sweeter and fresher honey fragrance (versus Egyptian Magic)...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s organic (Egyptian Magic isn&#x27;t)...</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It is everything it claims to be and more.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t scoop any out, just run my fingertip around on top and dab wherever I need moisture.  </li>
            <li> Until this magic in a jar.</li>
            <li> Bought this because i wanted an organic version of Egyptian Magic</li>
            <li> It has a distinctive odor, but so does egyptian magic.</li>
            <li> I tried Egyptian Magic</li>
            <li> I love this as a winter night cream.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t bother either of my sons, and I&#x27;m even able to put it on their faces.  </li>
            <li> I do love that it doesn&#x27;t have added fragrance (which makes some people think that the product is rancid).</li>
            <li> I found egyptian magic on pinterest and people were raving about it.</li>
            <li> I really think this is a great investment for beauty.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is magic</li>
            <li> One SB and then the slightly better EM.</li>
            <li> OK, so I know everyone raves about Egyptian Magic, but I&#x27;ve tried both, and I like Medicine Mama&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li> It seems to be more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> If you have ever tried Egyptian magic you will love this.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> using Bee Magic</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> I suggest that you guys buy it :]</li>
            <li> This product is a very rich oily product.  </li>
            <li> more, more easily so watch your application amount.  </li>
            <li> After reading all of the great reviews,  I was pretty excited about trying this product.  </li>
            <li> At first, I was put off because it doesn&#x27;t smell good.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;ll be excellent for the skin in the dry winter.</li>
            <li> I originally went online to buy Egyptian Magic but the reviews brought me over to Bee Magic.  </li>
            <li> But since I was excited to try, I tried Bee Magic on my hands and my skin seem to love it.</li>
            <li> that he&#x27;s becoming self-conscious about.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you, Amazon for carrying this product and thank you Sweet Blessed Bee Magic for your fantastic product!  </li>
            <li> I really never thought this would work like this, but my skin is the best it&#x27;s ever been.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more of a lightly greasy ointment.</li>
            <li> You can always add more if you feel your first application wasn&#x27;t effective</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t feel that much difference between it and good moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> , I heard this bee magic was almost identical with a bonus on being budget friendly.</li>
            <li> When I have blemishes, it helps heal them very quickly.</li>
            <li> Easily absorbed&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Absorbs easily.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good, all natural product with many uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d leave the house looking great, but by 2 PM there would be &amp;#34;islands&amp;#34; of makeup on my face where the makeup had managed to accumulate, leaving the rest of my face bare.  </li>
            <li> and I contribute it to Sweet Blessed Bee Magic.</li>
            <li> Tried Sweet Bee and the Egyptian Magic and neither of them have any benefits for my skin.</li>
            <li> It is oily but very good for her dry skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Bee Magic, it is amazing.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a decrease in any discoloration or scars on my skin, but it certainly is helping me keep my skin healthy!</li>
            <li> Seems to diminish the look of fine lines.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what it says it is, Sweet BLESSED Bee Magic!</li>
            <li> My son had huge patches of puffy, itchy eczema</li>
            <li> This has been a huge help for my lips and is a great facial moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I believe) it would be a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin look smoother and more colorful.</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth, even-toned and glowing.</li>
            <li> I apply this lightly all over my face and neck and allow to absorb.</li>
            <li> and my skin is back to feeling and looking great.</li>
            <li> my skin smooth</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> It is so smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fabulous and worth the money for sure.  </li>
            <li> I had tried everything - I even used proactive for a couple of months right before this (i just ran out) and this cream worked BETTER than proactive...</li>
            <li> you can apply to this beautiful little product here, bee magic :D.  </li>
            <li> Not thick but light and effective.</li>
            <li> but as far as a moisturizer it works exceptionally well.</li>
            <li> me, this truly is a MAGIC cream because it really works!  </li>
            <li> I like it but do not see the significant improvements of skin as described by some others.</li>
            <li> first I did some research and came across a comment about the Bee Magic cream.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s significantly cheaper.  </li>
            <li> I wipe it clean and put some of this stuff on</li>
            <li> I just received my Sweet Blessed Bee Magic today and used it for the first time following a calcium benotite clay mask - my skin feels amazing - smooth, supple, and luscious!</li>
            <li> I love how bee magic is already soft.</li>
            <li> The product isa great moisturizer for dry skin.</li>
            <li> No chemicals to worry about either, which is super important to me…your skin is your largest organ and anything you put on it</li>
            <li> It is pricey, but it is full of beneficially ingredients I believe to be totally worth it!</li>
            <li> oh wow I love it!</li>
            <li> The Sweet Bee Magic cream is, by far, my favorite.</li>
            <li> I am really surprised and don&#x27;t plan on stopping using this Bee Magic!</li>
            <li> Works great on zits as well... softens them right up and takes out the red.</li>
            <li> and this is great for dry skin!  </li>
            <li> My skin is dull on my best day..</li>
            <li> I chose this product because of it&#x27;s organic production and apparent similarity to Egyptian Magic which I&#x27;ve used for many years.  </li>
            <li> This is great stuff for the rough spots on your body.  </li>
            <li> but I love this stuff so much.</li>
            <li> I love it so much that I bought two jars for my mom.</li>
            <li> and I applied Sweet Bee on them after his bath while he was still damp.  </li>
            <li> the cream is VERY greasy, and seems to stay on top of my skin.</li>
            <li> I tried it on an itchy spot that was about to become a full fledged rash.</li>
            <li> Magic is really magic!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than egyptian magic too.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> The Bee Magic felt good, but so did shea butter and cocoa butter, so it really wasn&#x27;t worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li> This is pure and natural and feels good</li>
            <li> but if anyone here wants to suggest a better makeup for use over this, I&#x27;d certainly be willing to listen!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and his friend was swearing I was pregnant....</li>
            <li> Was super greasy and did not sink in.  </li>
            <li> I was using a mild soap with Donkey Milk which also gave me some relief</li>
            <li> I opened up Bee Magic, it smelled and looked the same as the Egyptian magic cream (EMC).</li>
            <li> The product itself is has a creamy consistency when removed from the jar and quickly melts from the warmth of your hands.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin with mild acne and rosacea.</li>
            <li> This seller also shipped quickly, I&#x27;d recommend both this product and the seller.</li>
            <li> I have very oily, fair, sensitive, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> Where I work I sell the other, more popular, version of this cream, but I was hoping that I could make an organic version myself.</li>
            <li> Unlike egyptian magic which doesn&#x27;t do organic and then have this explanation that says they don&#x27;t because they find some organic products are poorer quality than the normal  ingredients.</li>
            <li> Sometimes scrunch a bit in my hair, it&#x27;s good on dry feet, hands, elbows, basically anywhere.  </li>
            <li> I had tried Egyptian Magic in the past but somehow it never gave me results this good.</li>
            <li> I was a long term user of Egyptian Magic and switched to this in November 2012 after reading many favorable reviews.  </li>
            <li> Very greasy, but great for elbows, and extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Its ingredients are pure and you won&#x27;t have to worry about breaking out, although I&#x27;m sure the oily consistency may scare some people with very acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> It may seem oily when you apply it, but it does get absorbed if you don&#x27;t glom it on.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love that it&#x27;s organic and all natural.</li>
            <li> My own personal experiences with continued use have been positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every cent.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> My sons have eczema, and many of the lotions -- even those marked specifically for eczema -- burn them.  </li>
            <li> I love knowing it&#x27;s natural.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;For what it is worth, I am allergic to bee stings and I have not had any adverse reactions to this product.</li>
            <li> In this age we wash and dry all the beautiful natural oil in our hair</li>
            <li> Works pretty good on my dry hands, however, it&#x27;s too greasy to put on your face, gets in your hair.....</li>
            <li> and it seems to absorb pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I am delighted to have found this, and I concur with all of the other rave reviews here.  </li>
            <li> only it&#x27;s natural and full of good things.   </li>
            <li> Hey, this stuff really lasts, regardless of how I use it, so I might as well get my money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li> However i found for the price and overall effect of this so called magic cream to be nothing special.  </li>
            <li> This took the itch/sting right out.</li>
            <li> It is greasy, but we put it on right after bath time before bed</li>
            <li> I know the positive quality of bee pollen and royal jelly!</li>
            <li> I bought a jar of Sweet Blessed Bee Magic from a local health food store and have been putting it all over my face, legs, and hands.</li>
            <li> Medicine Mama&#x27;s Apothecary Sweet Blessed Bee Magic Cream is the only product that has worked for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s excellent on dry cuticles and very dry heels.  </li>
            <li> Bee Magic is more  like Petroleum Jelly and has a slightly stronger odor.&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li> skin, i.e. on freshly scrubbed, immediately after a hot bath.</li>
            <li> I got this originally because it was compared to Egyptian Magic which I really wanted to try because I watch a lot of tutorials on YouTube and its the big rage</li>
            <li> Very greasy feeling, but it soaks in fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> Also, you don&#x27;t need to use very much.</li>
            <li> The shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> This was recommended and much to my shock, it worked immediately!</li>
            <li> This cream can be used practically anywhere on the body and it absorbs in pretty well.</li>
            <li> First of all, I never write reviews for anything</li>
            <li> I have struggled with breakouts and problematic oily skin most of my life, and this is the only thing that I can say makes a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> dollars for \\&quot;Egyptian magic\\&quot; cream when this product has the EXACT same ingredients list buts its way more affordable.  </li>
            <li> Really!  </li>
            <li> After washing my face, it leaves it smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> So 3 starts for me, but it could get more from someone with a different skin type..</li>
            <li> It is creamer and more solid.  </li>
            <li> I have used Egyptian Magic prior</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;It spreads very well on my skin!</li>
            <li> No such issue with Bee Magic.</li>
            <li> As a personal note, I have also used Egyptian Magic.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> Will buy more, and my skin looks much younger.</li>
            <li> It soaks in within seconds and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily, just soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li> This product really clogged my pores!  </li>
            <li> We will buy more when this is gone, although I expect it to last a while.</li>
            <li> First, let me tell you that I abuse my face.</li>
            <li> It is intimidating how greasy it looks at first, but it does soak into your skin after 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> and it reeks of rancid olive oil (unlike the first bottle).  </li>
            <li> After the next use, the dry patches were becoming softer and smoother, and best of all - the blemishes were clearing and no new spots!&lt;br /&gt;Today - just 6 days after first use of the cream - my face is completely healed.</li>
            <li> It is a bit greasy (the main ingredient is Olive oil), but once it is applied to the skin, it is absorbed within 5-10 min and skin no longer feels oily.</li>
            <li> container should last for many applications (depending on how much of your body on which you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be aware that in warm weather, you might be chased by a swarm of bees or other insects!</li>
            <li> My raw, chapped nose and lips looked and felt so much better so quickly!</li>
            <li> I drink way to much coffee,not enough water and on top of it I have large pores along with combination skin.</li>
            <li> I think shea butter and cocoa butter are just as good, so I am not able to recommend this product at this price.  </li>
            <li> : creamy and soft but on the mildly oily side as it contains organic olive and fruit oil.</li>
            <li> I was happy though that I had gotten my acne down to the point where I only had one zit at a time.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a cheaper alternative to L&#x27;Occitane&#x27;s pure Shea butter &amp; tried this product.</li>
            <li> It instantly smooths out fine lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine that I can only use the cream at night</li>
            <li> The creme healed little problem areas and really does a nice job of hydrating and softening your skin.  </li>
            <li> I think EM is a little better on the quality if i had to choose but neither of them are worth buying to me.</li>
            <li> This creme is very versatile.  </li>
            <li> It works and it works VERY WELL.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to hype it too much, but if you are on the fence, just try it.  </li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> it really work my son eczema on his body, recommended</li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Just like the name, it&#x27;s really a blessing to have.</li>
            <li> I wash my face and apply the cream before bed, and then in the morning my skin is ready to go for the day.</li>
            <li> Just very moisturizing and fullens.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had cystic acne for over twenty years and have really tried everything.  </li>
            <li> My only concern is the price, I started to order more and the price is ten dollars more than last time.</li>
            <li> Egyptian magic is a thicker harder consistency.</li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t really meant to absorb - so it can sit on skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> never use my EMC during the day because it&#x27;s sticky and my skin doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb it very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Application: I&#x27;ve applied this to various, non-serious wounds, scars, as a moisturizer for face and body, and applied lightly to my hair.</li>
            <li> had a harder texture and smelled more &#x27;industrial&#x27; like petroleum type.y</li>
            <li> The EM had a harder texture and smelled more &#x27;industrial&#x27; like petroleum type.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;this very problematic acne.  </li>
            <li> I am very grateful we found it.</li>
            <li> Really softens my skin.  </li>
            <li> Definitely keeps the skin moisturized and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It does have an aroma, not pungent, just earthy and very mellow.  </li>
            <li> I have tried pulling the skin off, exfoliating, lots of lotions, potions, oils, and even straight vitamin E 70,000</li>
            <li> iu, nothing really worked.</li>
            <li> I finally feel comfortable in my skin in over 2 years.</li>
            <li> A very soothing and healing cream.</li>
            <li> But the product is very sticky, and does not absorb into my skin.</li>
            <li> olive oil works just as well and is so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> only use it at night or when I have free time at home&lt;br /&gt;Greasy</li>
            <li> I found a recipe online where you can make something very similiar with olive oil, beeswax and coconut oil for alot cheaper.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product if you dont mind spending so much for 4oz</li>
            <li> I know when someone wants to try it, they will.</li>
            <li> really recommend it also for the feet.&lt;br /&gt;Bee</li>
            <li> I feels kind of heavy</li>
            <li> Love the simple, natural combination of ingredients.</li>
            <li> skin issues in the family (razor burn, dry skin, allergic rash, children&#x27;s skin problems, etc), smells nice, a little goes far, clean non-toxic product, better price than major competitor.</li>
            <li> His dry patches have improved and his skin is becoming softer and conditioned.</li>
            <li> I own other products that are all natural and made with olive oil</li>
            <li> My hair looks, full, shiny, never dry and never greasy.  </li>
            <li> Other reviews have said it has a \\&quot;sweet honey smell\\&quot; and I don&#x27;t find that to be true at all.</li>
            <li> I found my Bee Magic and gently coated his arms with it and very carefully put some on his face.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs easily.&lt;br /&gt;Terrific for re-hydrating those dry cuticles on fingers and toes, good prevention from dry, cracked heels when used daily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always look for a rich but absorbable cream during winter in mid west.&lt;br /&gt;Till</li>
            <li> I went to whole foods initially to buy the Egyptian Magic and next to it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Clinique Dark Spot Corrector and a Dr. prescription for my acne scars before using Bee Magic.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Scent: Definitely of bee origins, like a sweet honey.</li>
            <li> It has already reduced the raised scar under my arm significantly in two weeks, my face is so much softer and I see it helping with the dry winter skin and my under eye circles, and even chapped lips.  </li>
            <li> Use a new clean swab, spatula, or popsicle stick when going in for a second helping.</li>
            <li> my legs and feet have serious circulation and potential bed sore problems, this bee magic is more soothing and&lt;br /&gt;healing</li>
            <li> Bee magic goes on your skin rather oily, but my skin has become DRASTICALLY less oily since using the product.</li>
            <li> use this mainly at night on my face and in the day on my legs</li>
            <li> and they are starting to improve tremendously after using it.</li>
            <li> I bought Bee Magic a few months ago but hadn&#x27;t really used it yet.  </li>
            <li> The main ingrediant is olive oil</li>
            <li> Use this just before bed, wake up soon feeling very smooth, and yes a little died go along way</li>
            <li> Its really soothing on my very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My skin feels so very soft after using for just a week!</li>
            <li> Still, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for all.</li>
            <li> Dry ends and mild frizz are almost a memory until the very end of the day.</li>
            <li> Dry ends and mild frizz are almost a memory until the very end of the day.</li>
            <li> Nothing has really resolved my issue completely.</li>
            <li> It has really helped clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> and this really makes their skin soft.</li>
            <li> It smell stays on my skin for a long time, going back to Egyptian Magic.</li>
            <li> This cleared up perpetually dry skin  - meaning it was used for a week and a month later the skin is still healthy.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s amazing - in a couple hours it&#x27;s usually gone!  </li>
            <li> I have had wayyy better results using plain ol&#x27; Vaseline.</li>
            <li> I have combo/oily skin, and right now it is 95 degrees outside</li>
            <li> a hair conditioner/pomade--&lt;br /&gt;Results vary, but on coarse long locks--when lightly applied, does really well.</li>
            <li> Results vary, but on coarse long locks--when lightly applied, does really well.</li>
            <li> For the past couple of weeks, I&#x27;ve been using it as a daily body moisturizer after my morning shower, and so far, so good.</li>
            <li> I only get the tiniest pimples occasionally now and they clear up super fast!</li>
            <li> I will try it in the morning with an SPF lotion made specifically for facial skin and see how that works out, but even if you only use it as a night moisturizer, it is fantastic with no overpowering chemicals or fragrances.</li>
            <li> and I can review again later to tell you if that really works because that&#x27;ll really be a miracle.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a pretty long way with this stuff, but I love smothering it all over my face.</li>
            <li> I put some on the first night and noticed the difference the next day.</li>
            <li> steroid creams and only one consistently helps.  </li>
            <li> I tried using the bare minimum of the stuff and rubbing it in really well.  </li>
            <li> I paid $21 and usually pay about $30 for Egyptian Magic.</li>
            <li> It works out pretty well for my facial skin.</li>
            <li> Apply to barely damp skin, and rub it in very well.</li>
            <li> it came early in the mail!</li>
            <li> I bought a Clarisonic (love) and started using Sweet Bee Cream at night, and adding 2 drops of Dr. Hauschka Normalizing Day Oil to my moisturizer every morning (it is a bit expensive, but 6 months in -</li>
            <li> It smells faintly like olive oil and honey which I find pleasant</li>
            <li> Terrific for re-hydrating those dry cuticles on fingers and toes, good prevention from dry, cracked heels when used daily.    </li>
            <li> Only negative is that flies and insects love it, including bees!</li>
            <li> I dutifully kept using toners, acids, and anything drying to try and clear it up.  </li>
            <li> to clear oil?  </li>
            <li> I think these are showing up primarily because he isn&#x27;t careful enough in cleansing.  </li>
            <li> For years I have been trying to find a product that keeps my skin clear and helps clear up the breakouts I do have</li>
            <li> I was in a Natural Foods market and asked for a recommendation for a product that would help with my eczema.</li>
            <li> It is working wonders for my sons eczema and is natural and organic.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 30s with combination/ sensitive skin with acne problems.</li>
            <li> he&#x27;s been alive and we&#x27;ve tried 18+</li>
            <li> My 12-year old grandson went to some car races yesterday and was scheduled to spend the night.  </li>
            <li> Naturally, this eliminates the majority of beauty products on the market.  </li>
            <li> At the age of 30-something, it was unexpected and came out of nowhere.  </li>
            <li> One day, while chatting with my hair stylist - said that I needed to stop stripping my face of its natural oil.  </li>
            <li> Sensitive skin is soothed and does not react to this badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been reading online and thought I might have developed rosacea.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> The cream is so much softer, which leads to the next point ...&lt;</li>
            <li> But with EMC, I need to really put in effort to spread it properly across my skin.</li>
            <li> jelly.&lt;br /&gt;Bonus: it&#x27;s all natural ingredients, nothing artificial.&lt;br /&gt;Less</li>
            <li> Hair is most vulnerable when wet and is better to comb, brush, or pick through when drier.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hair is most vulnerable when wet and is better to comb, brush, or pick through when drier.    </li>
            <li> …that&#x27;s why I like natural products.  </li>
            <li> It heals, protects, and keeps everything soft.</li>
            <li> This product works very well for hand and body; however after putting it on my facial skin for 2-3 days, my face broke out like a teenager!!  </li>
            <li> It made my skin feel so soft and it cleared my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is softer, clearer, and even some old scarring is fading away.</li>
            <li> It smells like slightly old olive oil.</li>
            <li> Even though it looks like a thick Vaseline and is greasy at first, it absorbs really quickly and does not cause me to break out.</li>
            <li> Another is if you rub it on your lips it gives your lips a slightly fuller look which I do find to be kinda true</li>
            <li> Natural ingredients, soaks in well after shower, (a little goes a long way),  I mostly use it on my face and neck and am experimenting using it on the tips of my flyaway hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> have a very dry skin all over my body but especially on my feet, I put Bee Magic on my feet and all cracked and dry skin on my feet is gone!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It has a slight honey waxy smell, not unpleasant, natural smelling.  </li>
            <li> I still like the product for hands, heels, etc, but I would highly discourage others from using it as a facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> wounds have healed relatively quickly and with little or no scarring.</li>
            <li> Any product containing royal jelly &amp; propolis is good for you, provided it&#x27;s all natural with no parabens, pthalates or other unhealthy ingredients.</li>
            <li> it is heavier than a cream and really helps with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have chronically dry skin and chapped peeling lips despite how much water I drink.</li>
            <li> It is nice to know that the ingredients are all natural and organic, but it would be difficult to use as a day moisturizer since it contains no SPF.</li>
            <li> His face was quite burned from sitting in bleachers in the hot sun, especially around the cheeks, nose and forehead, and his lower arms where his short sleeved T-shirt left off, even after having applied sunscreen before the races.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not strong at all and fades quickly after application.</li>
            <li> important note: a little of this stuff goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> I definitely got a large cyst with every period and strangely enough a giant cyst every time it snowed.  </li>
            <li> Its consistency turns into an oil pretty much but this means you hardly have to use any.</li>
            <li> Within a matter of 3 weeks I went from having smooth, even skin to having dry, tight, flaky patches and breakouts.</li>
            <li> When oil oxidizes it creates free radicals and I am not sure what this does to the outside of the skin.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would function similar to lush&#x27;s ultrabland</li>
            <li> After that I was using a primer under Bare Minerals makeup.  </li>
            <li> I would use it again, but not at the big price that is charged for it, although I felt comforted knowing how natural it is.</li>
            <li> Take a few minutes and lie on a towel until it is absorbed.</li>
            <li> It is amazing, the smell is a little different, but not strong at all.</li>
            <li> My skin is brighter, less oily, more firm, pores are smaller and it helped clear up my acne.</li>
            <li> My order was received sooner than expected, and my second order even came with cute little samples!</li>
            <li> I only use natural products on my skin because I have topical and hormonal sensitivities to silicones and mineral oil/petroleum jelly.  </li>
            <li> and he has very sensitive skin that gets dry and flaky and rashy</li>
            <li> I live in AZ where it&#x27;s very dry</li>
            <li> This excellent paste got me through this year&#x27;s famously bad Massachusetts winter without the usual cracked skin on my fingers.  </li>
            <li> This is creamier and makes my skin very soft after it sinks in.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried alot of things over the years, this has completely cleared up my acne and dry skin!  </li>
            <li> The actual product in the container has a smooth surface, but a little cracking type texture in one area as if it may have dried out a bit.  </li>
            <li> Even with my very minimal use so far, I&#x27;m already a devoted fan!</li>
            <li> At first I purchased this to use on my hands which are very dry from harsh astringent soaps at work (healthcare worker problems).  </li>
            <li> The ingredients are all organic and all natural and if you look at them; they&#x27;re all things you&#x27;ve heard of rather than the mystery ingredients in other lotions.  </li>
            <li> On the plus side though, my 7years old had some extremely unsightly bumps on her elbows</li>
            <li> Since only a tiny bit is needed, a jar lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It worked very well to moisturize my very dry skin, and I only needed to use it a few times a week.</li>
            <li> It will likely last a very long time, so for me</li>
            <li> I distribute a quarter (25 cents) amount through gently towel dried hair, and again when thoroughly dry.</li>

            <li> /&gt;The Sweet Blessed has a softer, creamier texture, smells much nicer and at this writing is less expensive when you buy either on Amazon by several dollars.&lt;br /&gt;The EM</li>

            <li> A small swipe through this stuff takes care of my whole face..</li>
            <li> I usually let me son choose which lotion he wants and he always chooses the &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; cream.</li>
            <li> in my last round of product buying craziness, I went to the doctor and got $600 (w/o insurance) pills to clear up my skin that helped but my acne came back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty thick and oily but not sticky.</li>
            <li> but it will last a long time!</li>
            <li> My husband uses it for hands, he gets tiny patches of dry skin on his hands.  </li>
            <li> My elbows are extra dry</li>
            <li> for dry skin&lt;br /&gt;Brings color back to my face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Either way this product is the only thing that prevents my dry skin.</li>
            <li> While this is more expensive than petroleum jelly, there is really no comparison.  </li>
            <li> and I just realized that I haven&#x27;t had a single blemish this entire time.  </li>
            <li> I am a  black person and was skeptical of the reviews which I felt came mostly from white people.</li>
            <li> which compared to a full face of huge painful cystic nodules - I&#x27;ll take any day!  </li>
            <li> As other views stated, this is greasy, smells weird, and just didn&#x27;t really do all that much for my skin!</li>
            <li> I have quite a few other lotions/ointments with very similar ingredients (Honey Girl, Egyptian Magic, Africa&#x27;s Secret, etc), but none work as well as this does.  </li>
            <li> If I could turn back the clock, I wouldn&#x27;t have spent the money on this.</li>
            <li> Yes, this has the consistency of Vaseline and it never really completely soaks in.  </li>
            <li> I have tried dozens of natural remedies: coconut oil, lanolin, neem oil, just to name a few.  </li>
            <li> Then in the reviews people were saying how this product was better and less expensive.</li>
            <li> This is basically identical to Egyptian magic, except that it&#x27;s all organic which EM is not, and it is significantly less expensive.</li>
            <li> Just bought more because I know my family is going to be using it like crazy during the dry months.</li>
            <li> The next morning, my skin was definitely less red, it was \\&quot;calmer.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> He is having very few new</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll also rub some of the leftover cream on my lips and now they are very soft with no more dry lines!&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I believe this jar will last me for ages because it takes so little to cover my entire face.</li>
            <li> have several friends who now use it due to my recommend and I plan on continuing to use it too.</li>
            <li> I have been chelating with herbs to get the mercury out of my blood and organs, and the original rash which indicated my blood was dirty, turned into a much itchier and raw rash as the toxins worked their way out of my body through my skin.  </li>
            <li> Hands, cuticles, dry feet, face, you name it.  </li>
            <li> My hands have improved dramatically while applying this to my baby, my hands were dry and cracking.</li>
            <li> - I use it on my face, on a scar under my arm and on my son&#x27;s dry patches and face.  </li>
            <li> I use it for dry skin and patches of eczema on my brow and forehead area.  </li>
            <li> I never get dry or flaky patches anymore.</li>
            <li> It has already taken care of some dry spots.</li>
            <li> So, I stopped using toners and all products meant to &#x27;dry out&#x27; oily skin.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for a psoriasis treatment and dry skin treatment.  </li>
            <li> I still haven&#x27;t found anything that works as well for my dry hands though.</li>
            <li> I have dry flaky skin and using Retin A doesn&#x27;t help my flaking issues.</li>
            <li> Some face wash dry out my skin and make it flakey,</li>
            <li> I have dry skin except my face which is combination.</li>
            <li> scars have vanished in relative short time (few months).</li>
            <li> After using it for only a few days, I noticed that my pores are smaller and my skin is softer to touch in areas where I apply the cream.</li>
            <li> Even though the product is oily, I have not had a single pimple in areas where I have applied it (and my skin is prone to acne).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i am a 26 yr old mom of two small kids.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that my dark circles and puffiness under my eyes are much smaller.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for several weeks and have not seen the drastic difference that some described in dark spots and complexion.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed as I expected improvement but not complete results.  </li>
            <li> It took me over 2 weeks to get my skin to settle back down.  </li>
            <li> The little tub will last you a long while.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a little oily, but if you have very dry skin, as I do, you&#x27;ll find the oiliness doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Especially since this is a little cheaper and the ingredients are organic.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time since a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My son is 3 months old and started teething so he sucks on his hands and drools and gets little red bumps on his face around his mouth.  </li>
            <li> Even when I&#x27;ve put too much on I haven&#x27;t broken out or had any problems.  </li>
            <li> Just so-so results, not as expected</li>
            <li> all provided minimal temporary relief but the rash persisted.  </li>
            <li> I have also heard it used for rough elbows, knees, heels, and even for hair.</li>
            <li> Apply it your cracked heels, or rough cuticles and you&#x27;ll be amazed by the results.</li>
            <li> I have some rough patches on my forehead and even after a month of using the cream they did not change.</li>
            <li> I use it as well on my rough heels and as lip balm.  </li>
            <li> I gave this four stars instead of five because it does go on slightly greasy, but it didn&#x27;t take long for my skin to drink it all in.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this cream.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little truly goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> As always a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but if I can find other products that treat dry skin that are less costly I will do so.</li>
            <li> More like ointment,  it was a little disappointing that this is so heavy</li>
            <li> My skin also is less irritated from occasional glycolic acid and the Retin A and hydroquinone product I use on parts of my face every few days.</li>
            <li> If my skin is tight, dry or itchy, all it takes is one use of this overnight</li>
            <li> If you an get past the smell, this is a terrific product.</li>
            <li> I look forward to learning and finding all the other uses for it</li>
            <li> No more itching, actual overnight relief!  </li>
            <li> I first was skeptical of this</li>
            <li> Do not put other garbage on them.  </li>
            <li> Some other reviewers have noted that it doesn&#x27;t sink in for them.</li>
            <li> I wear heavy make-up for long durations.</li>
            <li> Helps with dryness due to thyroid condition.</li>
            <li> I also use it on his legs as he has a few dry patches for some reason.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money to buy this item.</li>
            <li> I have dark lashes as it is though.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Heals dark spots from picking at my face&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Heals dark circles under</li>
            <li> short time, so the acne spots that have been around for years are slow in fading.  </li>
            <li> No…it&#x27;s not hot, I just put this $… on everything!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s still a layer of the cream over my skin, but it&#x27;s thinner and much less</li>
            <li> Piercings (lobe) site(s) have had less discomfort.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there is even a slight honey smell to it.</li>
            <li> This product is less expensive and is all natural and organic!</li>
            <li> first time using it, I used too much and the greasy feeling was terrible.</li>
            <li> A little about me to get an idea on my skin..</li>
            <li> &amp; I feel as though my face has a little bit of glow.</li>
            <li> I saw this little healing cream and decided to buy it instead.  </li>
            <li> Makes me a little nervous to use it.  </li>
            <li> complexion was a mess - I think a combination of harsh winter, aging (I&#x27;m 48), not adjusting my products as my skin changed.</li>
            <li> I use a little of this with Skinceuticals Phytocorrective Gel and their vitamin c and e product at night.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little greasy, but, thankfully, it works for me.</li>
            <li> At night (before bed) I wash my face and apply it a little thicker..</li>
            <li> I feel bad for all the people I see (male and female) with dry, lifeless hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this at whole foods one day when I had a cold and thought vaseline might help with chapped skin.  </li>
            <li> After spending about $150 on products at Sephora - none that helped - I was getting desperate and ready to make an appointment with a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it off and on for a few weeks now and it seems to work</li>
            <li> SO; I apply this on them and they&#x27;re smoothing out and nearly invisible; but unfortunately stretch</li>
            <li> Not a cheap product to &#x27;test&#x27;.</li>
            <li> The next night I used a lighter hand, and just applied a thin film.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> If you have a few bucks to spare, I recommend you try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it is messy</li>
            <li> When I wear makeup it looks worse and piles on the dead skin, which looks gross.</li>
            <li> On a scale of 0 to 5, Olive oil is a 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please see site below for comedogenic rating of olive oil and other commonly used oils.</li>
            <li> Please see site below for comedogenic rating of olive oil and other commonly used oils.</li>
            <li> The little dry spots I had &amp; the small pimples all have gone way!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it everyday on my face (usually overnight)</li>
            <li> since I use 100% raw royal jelly and buy bee pollen.  </li>
            <li> I recommended it to a friend who has eczema and gets raw skin areas from time to time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to send it to my boyfriend who is a model in new york; thats how crazy I am about it.</li>
            <li> The lid wasn&#x27;t even on very tight.  </li>
            <li> He slept like a baby and by this morning he said that the burned area was no longer painful, and you could see that much of the redness had disappeared.</li>
            <li> my woman time now..which usually &#x3D; acne breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I can get past the smell.</li>
            <li> and I rub a small dab in my hand and apply it to my hair along with my face.  </li>
            <li> No more chemicals and no more skin discoloration</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been prescribed every acne medication over the years and over the past year I&#x27;ve been on a mix of prescriptions that keep the acne to what I thought was a minimum.  </li>
            <li> It stays oily and slick on the surface of your face.</li>
            <li> No more itches or rashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I usually use it at night.</li>
            <li> I put it on very thin after showering for the day, then put my make up on about 5 minutes later.</li>
            <li> It also works well on hard foot callouses.  </li>
            <li> I NEVER write reviews on Amazon products, but I had to for this product to at least save others their time and money.</li>
            <li> At least until I begin abusing my face again.</li>
            <li> Both have negative reactions like skin peeling and dryness.</li>
            <li> It smells of beeswax and was too thick.</li>
            <li> and I really do mean the title of my review.</li>
            <li> it does mean it will be easier for you to dig in and use</li>
            <li> The only reason I won&#x27;t give this 5 stars is because I find the smell unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> are fading and have become very small.  </li>
            <li> Seriously if you are hesitating about buying this, just do it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not pleasant.</li>
            <li> The smell was not pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Maybe they should make one with Coconut oil which oxidizes very slowly.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s less expensive!</li>
            <li> This is thee worse smelling stuff</li>
            <li> I spread it thinly, otherwise it&#x27;s greasy.  </li>
            <li> Eventually, they thin out your skin, plus, as soon as I stop using them, the rash comes back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an unpleasant enough odor to prevent me from continuing to use it, but I do find the smell unpleasant.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this product.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it discolors his skin.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> : still expensive.</li>
            <li> It smells a bit like stale honey.</li>
            <li> and the supplies are expensive.</li>
            <li> sometimes if he uses the wrong products.</li>
            <li> My skin is not perfect.</li>
            <li> I gave him ice water in a bowl with a washcloth which he used as a cold compress, but he said that it still burned.  </li>
            <li> Ponds Cold</li>
            <li> Its a real game changer.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m just mad</li>
            <li> I had a bad breakout for a month and this cream healed in within a week, no joke.</li>
            <li> But when I feel bad about all of the abuse to my face, I just apply this cream to my face overnight for a week, and all is healed.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad either.</li>
            <li> I use this version in my in home treatments as a massage base.</li>
            <li> But when I opened this product it smelled HORRIBLE.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t horrible.  </li>
            <li> About 6 months ago, I had a terrible acne problem.  </li>
            <li> I get horrible eczema breakouts.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great balm- it is heavier than a cream and really helps with dry skin. I use it for my hands at night and it helps. I will order more when I am out of it but it will last a long time!</li>
            <li> A little about me to get an idea on my skin.. i am a 26 yr old mom of two small kids.Ive been prematurely aging since I was 14, I&#x27;ve abused my skin,and I don&#x27;t get enough sleep, I fall asleep with makeup on, and Work in fast food, wearing heavy coverage makeup. I drink way to much coffee,not enough water and on top of it I have large pores along with combination skin.My skin is dull on my best day.. I am on well my woman time now..which usually &#x3D; acne breakouts.  I am mind blown! I am glowing..no makeup.. My boyfriend and his friend was swearing I was pregnant....I&#x27;m on my woman time. No baby..I have no makeup on what&#x27;s o ever! So no help with highlighters! And i have 2 tiny pimples,thats it! This is thee worse smelling stuff I&#x27;ve ever put on my face..reminds me a plastic stench..It&#x27;s not pleasant.But the already difference in my skin for having it now officially 3 days...I can get past the smell. I got this originally because it was compared to Egyptian Magic which I really wanted to try because I watch a lot of tutorials on YouTube and its the big rage, I heard this bee magic was almost identical with a bonus on being budget friendly. I know what&#x27;s in it and and I know the benefits of what&#x27;s in it. A small swipe through this stuff takes care of my whole face..This will last me months. If I don&#x27;t find more use for it. I&#x27;m in love and I will keep buying this. I&#x27;m not wasting a ton of money or time in the stores looking for any more hopeful fixes.</li>
            <li> best stuff on the planet!</li>
            <li> As other views stated, this is greasy, smells weird, and just didn&#x27;t really do all that much for my skin! I have had wayyy better results using plain ol&#x27; Vaseline. I am trying my best to use up the container and will def. not repurchase.</li>
            <li> I was in a Natural Foods market and asked for a recommendation for a product that would help with my eczema. This was recommended and much to my shock, it worked immediately! I have never been so satisfied with a product ever!  I am using it on my cuticles and hands as well.  Thank you, thank you!</li>
            <li> Very greasy, but great for elbows, and extremely dry skin.  If you an get past the smell, this is a terrific product.</li>
            <li> nice.. product I love the way it feels almost Skin</li>
            <li> This creme is very versatile.  Hands, cuticles, dry feet, face, you name it.  It works and it works VERY WELL.  I am delighted to have found this, and I concur with all of the other rave reviews here.  You cannot go wrong with this product.  It may seem oily when you apply it, but it does get absorbed if you don&#x27;t glom it on.  Even when I&#x27;ve put too much on I haven&#x27;t broken out or had any problems.  The creme healed little problem areas and really does a nice job of hydrating and softening your skin.  I use it at night on my face and hands.  It&#x27;s excellent on dry cuticles and very dry heels.  It&#x27;s ORGANIC.  No parabens! No ingredients that you can neither spell nor pronounce.  And it will last you awhile. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I bought this at whole foods one day when I had a cold and thought vaseline might help with chapped skin.  I asked someone who worked there if they had anything that might help, and this product was recommended.  While this is more expensive than petroleum jelly, there is really no comparison.  I love this stuff!  My raw, chapped nose and lips looked and felt so much better so quickly! I carry this stuff around with me now. I put it on my cuticles on the way to a meeting and even without a manicure my nails looked great.  I burned my finger on a toaster and put this stuff on and the burn went away.  I look forward to learning and finding all the other uses for it, it is truly a great product and I&#x27;m so glad I found it. I don&#x27;t want to hype it too much, but if you are on the fence, just try it.  The one I bought is a 2oz container, and even though I have been using it constantly, it seems like it will last a while.</li>
            <li> use with caution. broke me out on my face. I was hoping it would function similar to lush&#x27;s ultrabland but it has a different consistency. i woke up with white heads all over my face.</li>
            <li> This cream can be used practically anywhere on the body and it absorbs in pretty well. I use it as a cuticle cream, as a lip balm, as a leg cream, etc. It has a million and one different uses and it doesn&#x27;t smell and I really like it. A little goes a long way with this cream. Even gave a jar to my 90 year old mother who has terribly rough feet and she&#x27;s seeing a difference after two weeks. I think it&#x27;s a very good product and I&#x27;ve bought it repeatedly and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Just so-so results, not as expected</li>
            <li> it really work my son eczema on his body, recommended</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! It is working wonders for my sons eczema and is natural and organic. His dry patches have improved and his skin is becoming softer and conditioned. My hands have improved dramatically while applying this to my baby, my hands were dry and cracking. I would definatley recommend this product for your moisturizing and healing needs! My order was received sooner than expected, and my second order even came with cute little samples!</li>
            <li> First of all, I never write reviews for anything but I love this stuff so much. I am in my early 30s with combination/ sensitive skin with acne problems. I tried everything. in my last round of product buying craziness, I went to the doctor and got $600 (w/o insurance) pills to clear up my skin that helped but my acne came back. I bought a jar of Sweet Blessed Bee Magic from a local health food store and have been putting it all over my face, legs, and hands. I put some on the first night and noticed the difference the next day. My skin is brighter, less oily, more firm, pores are smaller and it helped clear up my acne. I feels kind of heavy but when you rub it on your face it&#x27;s not bad. I also noticed that my dark circles and puffiness under my eyes are much smaller. I love it so much that I bought two jars for my mom. I wish they had one in a smaller container so I could carry it in my purse.</li>
            <li> Was super greasy and did not sink in.  Left my skin with break outs.  Not worth the money to buy this item.</li>
            <li> I love love love this - I use it on my face, on a scar under my arm and on my son&#x27;s dry patches and face.  It has already reduced the raised scar under my arm significantly in two weeks, my face is so much softer and I see it helping with the dry winter skin and my under eye circles, and even chapped lips.  My husband uses it for hands, he gets tiny patches of dry skin on his hands.  My son is 3 months old and started teething so he sucks on his hands and drools and gets little red bumps on his face around his mouth.  I wipe it clean and put some of this stuff on and it&#x27;s amazing - in a couple hours it&#x27;s usually gone!  I also use it on his legs as he has a few dry patches for some reason.  It&#x27;s fabulous and worth the money for sure.  The price on amazon is also competitive as I saw it at mother&#x27;s for about the same price.</li>
            <li> I needed a good face cream during chemo while battling breast cancer, so I chose this one after looking at many. I wanted one which does not have cancer causing ingredients and would hydrate my skin well. I get so many wonderful compliments on my skin and I contribute it to Sweet Blessed Bee Magic. It has become my #1 face cream. I really couldn&#x27;t be happier. I went through so many hormonal changes with my cancer medications and I never broke out once. Just like the name, it&#x27;s really a blessing to have.</li>
            <li> While on vacation, I contracted an itchy rash (bug bites, allergic reaction, or both) which plagued me for 6 weeks.  I slathered myself with Benadryl gel, Cetaphil lotion, and even tried a prescription cream - all provided minimal temporary relief but the rash persisted.  I was using a mild soap with Donkey Milk which also gave me some relief but once I started using this cream, the rash was gone within a week&#x27;s time!&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I attract mosquitos &amp; fleas and their bites will itch for weeks.  Recently, I got several bug bites on the back of my leg &amp; hip.  I used this cream and... voila!  No more itching, actual overnight relief!  I&#x27;ll also rub some of the leftover cream on my lips and now they are very soft with no more dry lines!&lt;br /&gt;For me, this truly is a MAGIC cream because it really works!  LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> Smells great and really helps my skin. I use it at night because it&#x27;s too greasy for day use. Seems to diminish the look of fine lines. Absolutely love that it&#x27;s organic and all natural. Will definitely purchase again!!</li>
            <li> This is my second jar. So much better than Egyptian  magic. Organic ingredients make this a better value... And it&#x27;s less expensive!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  I have psoriasis and this is one of the few things that really provide relief from itchiness and dryness.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I am a  black person and was skeptical of the reviews which I felt came mostly from white people. However, I have tried it from June to now (2 months now)  and it does leave you with a  glow. I think my skin is looking positively better ( clearer)  now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this mainly at night on my face and in the day on my legs and I absolutely love the look and feel of skin after use.</li>
            <li> This is a re-order.  I use it for dry skin and patches of eczema on my brow and forehead area.  I spread it thinly, otherwise it&#x27;s greasy.  A little goes a long way.  Great product to have on hand.</li>
            <li> my legs and feet have serious circulation and potential bed sore problems, this bee magic is more soothing and&lt;br /&gt;healing than the doctor prescribed medication, being confined o bed or chair any thing giving more comfort is&lt;br /&gt;a blessing</li>
            <li> It works just as well as Egyptian Magic but it&#x27;s cheaper, so I buy whichever&#x27;s the lesser price between the two.</li>
            <li> I NEVER write reviews on Amazon products, but I had to for this product to at least save others their time and money. While this product sounds great and I am sure if you bought it in store (it&#x27;s sold in Whole Foods I believe) it would be a fantastic product. But when I opened this product it smelled HORRIBLE. I own other products that are all natural and made with olive oil and they smell nothing like this. I don&#x27;t know if the product smells this way because of how it was stored prior to shipping or if it turned from the heat of shipping but I would not risk purchasing this product online. My recommendation: test out the product and scent in store before you buy.</li>
            <li> I just received my Sweet Blessed Bee Magic today and used it for the first time following a calcium benotite clay mask - my skin feels amazing - smooth, supple, and luscious! I believe this jar will last me for ages because it takes so little to cover my entire face. I gave this four stars instead of five because it does go on slightly greasy, but it didn&#x27;t take long for my skin to drink it all in. Now, several hours later (I haven&#x27;t applied any makeup or anything else), my skin looks dewy and moisturized - not at all greasy. It is nice to know that the ingredients are all natural and organic, but it would be difficult to use as a day moisturizer since it contains no SPF. I will try it in the morning with an SPF lotion made specifically for facial skin and see how that works out, but even if you only use it as a night moisturizer, it is fantastic with no overpowering chemicals or fragrances. I have also heard it used for rough elbows, knees, heels, and even for hair. I plan to try all these uses and I will amend my review with further information once I have experimented with all these potential uses.  Even with my very minimal use so far, I&#x27;m already a devoted fan!</li>
            <li> Read rave review and decided to try this product.  However i found for the price and overall effect of this so called magic cream to be nothing special.  Placebo effect? for those who bought into magic of bee pollen &amp; royal jelly.  I know the positive quality of bee pollen and royal jelly! since I use 100% raw royal jelly and buy bee pollen.  However, this cream does not delivers.  Maybe it has to do with the actual amount of bee pollen &amp; royal jelly that was included in this cream?  Since there is no label stating the % of each ingredients, I am going to assume that I overpay for the name rather than for the actual ingredient (bee pollen &amp; royal jelly) used to make this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I have another like it but it has a tad more wax.  This is creamier and makes my skin very soft after it sinks in.  If it doesn&#x27;t sink in quickly enough, I just blot it with a tissue and I&#x27;m good to go.  I recommended it to a friend who has eczema and gets raw skin areas from time to time.  She said th s helped a lot.   It&#x27;s kind of like Neosporin only it&#x27;s natural and full of good things.   It also has a nice, homey aroma.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews on amazon, but had to let everyone know that this is the best product that I have ever found. I have struggled with breakouts and problematic oily skin most of my life, and this is the only thing that I can say makes a noticeable difference. When I have blemishes, it helps heal them very quickly. Bee magic goes on your skin rather oily, but my skin has become DRASTICALLY less oily since using the product. I wash my face and apply the cream before bed, and then in the morning my skin is ready to go for the day. A little bit goes a pretty long way with this stuff, but I love smothering it all over my face. My skin is so thankful for the extra moisturizer throughout the seasons. I never get dry or flaky patches anymore. Love the simple, natural combination of ingredients. Completely flawless. Seriously if you are hesitating about buying this, just do it. Its a real game changer.</li>
            <li> I originally went online to buy Egyptian Magic but the reviews brought me over to Bee Magic.  It really is amazing!  I use it as a moisturizer in the morning and at night.  I&#x27;ve tried alot of things over the years, this has completely cleared up my acne and dry skin!  It actually does work!  Sometimes scrunch a bit in my hair, it&#x27;s good on dry feet, hands, elbows, basically anywhere.  It has a slight honey waxy smell, not unpleasant, natural smelling.  I love this!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it off and on for a few weeks now and it seems to work well but I don&#x27;t feel that much difference between it and good moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion!!! I have been using for about a week now &amp; I feel as though my face has a little bit of glow. The little dry spots I had &amp; the small pimples all have gone way!! I recommend this to everyone,</li>
            <li> For two months now, I have applied a dab to my face each morning. It makes my skin look smoother and more colorful. But if you put more than a dab on, you look greasy, like people on TV with a lot of makeup. I like it a lot and I really do mean the title of my review. I do not know if it provides long-term effects. Still, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because of it&#x27;s organic production and apparent similarity to Egyptian Magic which I&#x27;ve used for many years.  The difference between this product and EM is this one appears softer, ie there&#x27;s probably more wax in the Egyptian Magic.  Although that means it&#x27;s probably better ingredient-wise it does mean it will be easier for you to dig in and use more, more easily so watch your application amount.  I&#x27;m a 50&#x27;s male and I rub a small dab in my hand and apply it to my hair along with my face.  In this age we wash and dry all the beautiful natural oil in our hair and this is a good replacement.  My hair looks, full, shiny, never dry and never greasy.  I feel bad for all the people I see (male and female) with dry, lifeless hair.</li>
            <li> People pay 35+ dollars for \\&quot;Egyptian magic\\&quot; cream when this product has the EXACT same ingredients list buts its way more affordable.  SO; every incredible thing you&#x27;ve heard about Egyptian magic. you can apply to this beautiful little product here, bee magic :D.  I went to whole foods initially to buy the Egyptian Magic and next to it I saw this little healing cream and decided to buy it instead.  I couldn&#x27;t be more happy. Its consistency turns into an oil pretty much but this means you hardly have to use any. The little tub will last you a long while.  The ingredients are all organic and all natural and if you look at them; they&#x27;re all things you&#x27;ve heard of rather than the mystery ingredients in other lotions.  Okay so let me tell you why you should not go another day without this.  This Miracle Healing Cream will even out your skin tone which I think is incredible. My main cause for wearing makeup is to even out my skin tone and with this product I feel beautiful without make up! Really!  It instantly smooths out fine lines and wrinkles, I&#x27;m a teenager so this isn&#x27;t a big problem for me yet but I feel confident that I&#x27;m preventing wrinkles and my face looks like I haven&#x27;t had any skin damage from the sun or anything when I unfortunately have had a bit of sun exposure. My under-eyes look flawless.   Next, I have faded stretch marks from a growth spurt on the hip area and it always bothers me because it is swim suit season and I&#x27;m just mad I didn&#x27;t know this was coming when my hips decided to jut out. SO; I apply this on them and they&#x27;re smoothing out and nearly invisible; but unfortunately stretch marks seem to be permanent in nature.  Besides all these awesome things I&#x27;m specifically using the lotion for; its incredible for scars, works great on healing blemishes and popped acne. You can use it on burns, scabs, anything that needs some healing power. Its ingredients are pure and you won&#x27;t have to worry about breaking out, although I&#x27;m sure the oily consistency may scare some people with very acne-prone skin. It leave you radiating and glowing. I can not get over it. Apply it your cracked heels, or rough cuticles and you&#x27;ll be amazed by the results. My elbows are extra dry and I throw this on and its problem solved in a matter of 5 minutes.    LASTLY, here&#x27;s two hints Ive heard of but haven&#x27;t done enough to prove.  I hear if you dab it on your eye lashes it&#x27;ll lengthen and thicken your eye lashes. I did today and I can review again later to tell you if that really works because that&#x27;ll really be a miracle. I have dark lashes as it is though.  Another is if you rub it on your lips it gives your lips a slightly fuller look which I do find to be kinda true but it can&#x27;t be mistaken as a lip plumper. Just very moisturizing and fullens.     I recommend this product to everyone.   I&#x27;m going to send it to my boyfriend who is a model in new york; thats how crazy I am about it. Its amazing. Invest now.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this. Will deff be purchasing again</li>
            <li> I LOVE this cream.  My kids love to eat it (NO!!!).  After washing my face, it leaves it smooth and soft.  It has worked wonders on my kids&#x27; eczema too.  My son had huge patches of puffy, itchy eczema and I applied Sweet Bee on them after his bath while he was still damp.  The next day it was GONE.  I was amazed as I expected improvement but not complete results.  My child has suffered from eczema for the entire seven years he&#x27;s been alive and we&#x27;ve tried 18+ steroid creams and only one consistently helps.  Unfortunately, it discolors his skin.  Sweet Bee to the rescue!!  No more chemicals and no more skin discoloration that he&#x27;s becoming self-conscious about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Amazon for carrying this product and thank you Sweet Blessed Bee Magic for your fantastic product!  You&#x27;ve made one mama and one (formerly) itchy boy very happy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had cystic acne for over twenty years and have really tried everything.  I&#x27;ve been prescribed every acne medication over the years and over the past year I&#x27;ve been on a mix of prescriptions that keep the acne to what I thought was a minimum.  I definitely got a large cyst with every period and strangely enough a giant cyst every time it snowed.  I was happy though that I had gotten my acne down to the point where I only had one zit at a time.  I missed a week or so of Retin-A and when I went back to using it I had all the old just-starting-out-with-Retin-A side effects, mostly redness and crazy peeling.  I ordered this cream to try to help with that.  It healed all the redness and peeling within a day and it felt so good that I just kept using it.  It&#x27;s been a couple months now and I just realized that I haven&#x27;t had a single blemish this entire time.  No hormonal breakouts and no weather-related breakouts (and we&#x27;ve had a lot of snow).  I really never thought this would work like this, but my skin is the best it&#x27;s ever been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that this isn&#x27;t a great moisturizer for under makeup.  I tried using the bare minimum of the stuff and rubbing it in really well.  After that I was using a primer under Bare Minerals makeup.  I&#x27;d leave the house looking great, but by 2 PM there would be &amp;#34;islands&amp;#34; of makeup on my face where the makeup had managed to accumulate, leaving the rest of my face bare.  It&#x27;s fine that I can only use the cream at night but if anyone here wants to suggest a better makeup for use over this, I&#x27;d certainly be willing to listen!</li>
            <li> the cream is VERY greasy, and seems to stay on top of my skin. I have some rough patches on my forehead and even after a month of using the cream they did not change. On the plus side though, my 7years old had some extremely unsightly bumps on her elbows (keratosis pilaris I guess) and they are starting to improve tremendously after using it. So 3 starts for me, but it could get more from someone with a different skin type..</li>
            <li> I bought it with Egyptian Magic, can&#x27;t tell the difference, both are good for my skin. I think it&#x27;ll be excellent for the skin in the dry winter.</li>
            <li> This is a nice organic moisturizer, I use it mostly on my face, hands and elbows. My only concern is the price, I started to order more and the price is ten dollars more than last time. So I guess it&#x27;s back to extra virgin coconut oil for me.</li>
            <li> Where I work I sell the other, more popular, version of this cream, but I was hoping that I could make an organic version myself. I was relieved to have found it already prepared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an esthetician. I use this version in my in home treatments as a massage base. Its very smooth and has great healing properties for damaged or torn skin.</li>
            <li> I prefer Egyptian magic over this brand.  It is creamer and more solid.  Bee Magic is more  like Petroleum Jelly and has a slightly stronger odor.&lt;br /&gt;Both will keep your skin moist.  Egyptian is better to put on the face and hands because it does not bleed.  Bee Magic is ok for the rest of your body.  I would not recommend using Bee Magic at night because it will bleed onto your bed spread or and pillow.&lt;br /&gt;SJS Chicago, Illinois</li>
            <li> Good for what ails you. I&#x27;ve used it on several skin conditions, and I swear by it. I&#x27;ve also recently started to use it as hair pomade. About a pea-sized amount does the trick. Hey, this stuff really lasts, regardless of how I use it, so I might as well get my money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li> This is all it claims to be.  A really terrific product for nourishing and protecting the skin.  Highly recommended for all.</li>
            <li> Congratulations that you have found this cream! Heals overnight on blisters. Thickens eye lashes, smooths skin, plumps lips. Wonderful facial cream! All over goodness!</li>
            <li> Great on skin. Cheaper than Egyptian Magic and works just as well. I have combo skin so if you have oily skin, probably not for you.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t absorb.  So, I suppose if you want to use it before bed, that might work, but I can&#x27;t imagine leaving the house with this on.  It wasn&#x27;t horrible.  It wasn&#x27;t magic.  If I could turn back the clock, I wouldn&#x27;t have spent the money on this.</li>
            <li> I bought Bee Magic a few months ago but hadn&#x27;t really used it yet.  My 12-year old grandson went to some car races yesterday and was scheduled to spend the night.  His face was quite burned from sitting in bleachers in the hot sun, especially around the cheeks, nose and forehead, and his lower arms where his short sleeved T-shirt left off, even after having applied sunscreen before the races. I gave him ice water in a bowl with a washcloth which he used as a cold compress, but he said that it still burned.  I found my Bee Magic and gently coated his arms with it and very carefully put some on his face.  It was instantaneous!  He said the burning was gone!  We reapplied again after his shower and just before bed.  He slept like a baby and by this morning he said that the burned area was no longer painful, and you could see that much of the redness had disappeared. I just had to give Bee Magic 5 stars!</li>
            <li> This excellent paste got me through this year&#x27;s famously bad Massachusetts winter without the usual cracked skin on my fingers.  It&#x27;s tacky even after being massaged in, so it&#x27;s not something I could grab during the day, but at night I&#x27;d rub it in while watching television.  It also works well on hard foot callouses.  I&#x27;ve been recommending this to everyone. It smells very nice, too.</li>
            <li> Not as good as Egyptian creme, but will do in a pinch. It stays oily and slick on the surface of your face.</li>
            <li> This product is a very rich oily product.  It is great for keeping your face from being wind burned or after you have been in the wind.  I have been using it for several weeks and have not seen the drastic difference that some described in dark spots and complexion.  I like it but do not see the significant improvements of skin as described by some others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for 2 nights, but it seems to do what is promised. It has already taken care of some dry spots.</li>
            <li> It is oily but very good for her dry skin. Uses after taking a bath or shower so it absorbs good.</li>
            <li> This is it!!! I use this for EVERYTHING! It is my night time face moisturizer, hair wax to help keep my bleached blonde ends happy, scar fading cream, cuticle softener, lip balm, cracked heel repair.  The list goes on.  I only use natural products on my skin because I have topical and hormonal sensitivities to silicones and mineral oil/petroleum jelly.  Naturally, this eliminates the majority of beauty products on the market.  However, with this product, I don&#x27;t need anything else.  A little truly goes a long way.  At first I purchased this to use on my hands which are very dry from harsh astringent soaps at work (healthcare worker problems).  One night I tried it on my face and the rest is history.  I have combo/oily skin, and right now it is 95 degrees outside and my skin is flawless.  This cream fades acne scars and keeps moisture issues in balance.  It is pricey, but it is full of beneficially ingredients I believe to be totally worth it!</li>
            <li> About 6 months ago, I had a terrible acne problem.  At the age of 30-something, it was unexpected and came out of nowhere.  I dutifully kept using toners, acids, and anything drying to try and clear it up.  Nothing helped!  One day, while chatting with my hair stylist - said that I needed to stop stripping my face of its natural oil.  I then went to see a facialist, and not only did she agree, but she suggested I put oil on my face.  Oil to clear oil?  I was skeptical.  The theory is that if you put oil on your skin, it stops creating extra oil that causes acne.  So, I stopped using toners and all products meant to &#x27;dry out&#x27; oily skin.  I bought a Clarisonic (love) and started using Sweet Bee Cream at night, and adding 2 drops of Dr. Hauschka Normalizing Day Oil to my moisturizer every morning (it is a bit expensive, but 6 months in - I&#x27;ve only used a third of the bottle).  Within a week, my skin started clearing up.  Now I get maybe 1-2 pimples a month - which compared to a full face of huge painful cystic nodules - I&#x27;ll take any day!  Yes, this has the consistency of Vaseline and it never really completely soaks in.  But, I put it on at night and let it sit on my face for 15 minutes or so.  Then, I take a paper towel and dab off the excess sitting on top of my skin.  No big deal.  The jar lasts for several months.  I don&#x27;t intend to be without this again!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I have used Egyptian Magic prior so I can compare. I first was skeptical of this but oh wow I love it! Egyptian magic is a thicker harder consistency. I would have to dig into it and let it melt in my fingers before applying. I love how bee magic is already soft. You do have an oily greasy look after applying so I only use it at night. I don&#x27;t recommend for morning or day use. When I wake up my skin looks so good. I&#x27;ve used Clinique Dark Spot Corrector and a Dr. prescription for my acne scars before using Bee Magic. Within 2 weeks of using Bee Magic I&#x27;m tossing all my spot correctors out the door. So good!</li>
            <li> Pros: Resolved many misc. skin issues in the family (razor burn, dry skin, allergic rash, children&#x27;s skin problems, etc), smells nice, a little goes far, clean non-toxic product, better price than major competitor. Sensitive skin is soothed and does not react to this badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: still expensive. isn&#x27;t really meant to absorb - so it can sit on skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried some of this at a friend&#x27;s house I was visiting when I got a rash while hiking. This took the itch/sting right out. My family has used this successfully on many skin issues. This cleared up perpetually dry skin  - meaning it was used for a week and a month later the skin is still healthy.</li>
            <li> Just received my product and am concerned that it was not sealed at all.  The lid wasn&#x27;t even on very tight.  Makes me a little nervous to use it.  The actual product in the container has a smooth surface, but a little cracking type texture in one area as if it may have dried out a bit.  Thinking I need to return it and source it elsewhere unless I can get a replacement that has some type of seal on the container.  Not a cheap product to &#x27;test&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Love this!!!  I use it for everything!  Very greasy feeling, but it soaks in fairly quickly.  I&#x27;ve bought one for me and let my step mother use it and she called asking for me to get her a jar too.  Lasts a long time since a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of kinds of over the counter and prescription preparations to combat an itchy rash I get whenever the weather gets warm or a piece of clothing rubs anywhere -  shea and cocoa butters, cortisone gels, steroid creams, you name it. Nothing has really resolved my issue completely. The steroid creams have worked best, but who wants to keep using those? Eventually, they thin out your skin, plus, as soon as I stop using them, the rash comes back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the great reviews for Sweet Bee Magic Skin Cream, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. And guess what? It seems to be working! I tried it on an itchy spot that was about to become a full fledged rash. The itching was gone within a day and hasn&#x27;t come back yet. No rash, either. For the past couple of weeks, I&#x27;ve been using it as a daily body moisturizer after my morning shower, and so far, so good. No more itches or rashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the cream itself...it&#x27;s more of a lightly greasy ointment. It smells a bit like stale honey. However, I don&#x27;t find the consistency or smell too offputting, because my skin soaks it up almost immediately and the smell disappears after a minute or two. Also, you don&#x27;t need to use very much.</li>
            <li> Its really soothing on my very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I purchased Bee Magic skin cream based on the reviews...and I&#x27;m so glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;My complexion was a mess - I think a combination of harsh winter, aging (I&#x27;m 48), not adjusting my products as my skin changed. Within a matter of 3 weeks I went from having smooth, even skin to having dry, tight, flaky patches and breakouts. I could not get it under control. After spending about $150 on products at Sephora - none that helped - I was getting desperate and ready to make an appointment with a dermatologist. I&#x27;d been reading online and thought I might have developed rosacea.&lt;br /&gt;But first I did some research and came across a comment about the Bee Magic cream. I found it here on Amazon and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;My first time using it, I used too much and the greasy feeling was terrible. The next night I used a lighter hand, and just applied a thin film. The next morning, my skin was definitely less red, it was \\&quot;calmer.\\&quot; After the next use, the dry patches were becoming softer and smoother, and best of all - the blemishes were clearing and no new spots!&lt;br /&gt;Today - just 6 days after first use of the cream - my face is completely healed. My skin is smooth, even-toned and glowing. I highly recommend Bee Magic, it is amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Egyptian magic cream until I saw a review from Amazon recommending Bee Magic instead. I&#x27;m so glad I took the advice! Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Softer consistency&lt;br /&gt;When I opened up Bee Magic, it smelled and looked the same as the Egyptian magic cream (EMC). When I pressed my finger in (I used some strength because you have to do that with Egyptian magic cream), my finger caused a dent the cream almost immediately. The cream is so much softer, which leads to the next point ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Easier to apply&lt;br /&gt;It spreads very well on my skin! I used the same method I always did with the EMC: I rubbed it between my palms before applying. But with EMC, I need to really put in effort to spread it properly across my skin. No such issue with Bee Magic. Thumbs up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Easily absorbed&lt;br /&gt;I never use my EMC during the day because it&#x27;s sticky and my skin doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb it very well. I sort of use it as a layer of barrier after my moisturizer to lock in the moisturizer. But since I was excited to try, I tried Bee Magic on my hands and my skin seem to love it. There&#x27;s still a layer of the cream over my skin, but it&#x27;s thinner and much less sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m never going back to EMC again!</li>
            <li> The product itself is has a creamy consistency when removed from the jar and quickly melts from the warmth of your hands. It is not like the cream sense of a commercial lotion, or something like Ponds Cold cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredient list is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;Organic extra virgin olive fruit oil, organic beeswax, organic honey, propolis extract, organic bee pollen and royal jelly.&lt;br /&gt;Bonus: it&#x27;s all natural ingredients, nothing artificial.&lt;br /&gt;Less is more. I suggest using this product light-handedly and wait for product to absorb into skin. You can always add more if you feel your first application wasn&#x27;t effective enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent: Definitely of bee origins, like a sweet honey. Very light, pleasant, and unobtrusive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture: creamy and soft but on the mildly oily side as it contains organic olive and fruit oil. Use light-handedly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application: I&#x27;ve applied this to various, non-serious wounds, scars, as a moisturizer for face and body, and applied lightly to my hair. I wash my hands thoroughly before I put my hand(s) in the jar, use an unused popsicle stick, or one of those cosmetic jar spatulas. For piercings, I&#x27;ve used a cotton swab. Use a new clean swab, spatula, or popsicle stick when going in for a second helping. This prevents bacteria from invading your jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness: Results vary. My own personal experiences with continued use have been positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--On wounds--&lt;br /&gt;(cat) scratches, scrapes/abrasions, (ear) piercings: wounds have healed relatively quickly and with little or no scarring. Piercings (lobe) site(s) have had less discomfort. Piercings seemed to heal faster with use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--On scars--&lt;br /&gt;new scars have vanished in relative short time (few months). Older scars have diminished and are less pronounced but am still working on them at this writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--As facial moisturizer--&lt;br /&gt; I apply this lightly all over my face and neck and allow to absorb. I have also mixed this with another facial moisturizer when I want to give it a boost of peptides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--As a body moisturizer--&lt;br /&gt;Works nicely, especially after a shower or bath. Absorbs easily.&lt;br /&gt;Terrific for re-hydrating those dry cuticles on fingers and toes, good prevention from dry, cracked heels when used daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--As a hair conditioner/pomade--&lt;br /&gt;Results vary, but on coarse long locks--when lightly applied, does really well. Dry ends and mild frizz are almost a memory until the very end of the day. I work this in with my hands and use a boar hair brush to finish.

            <li> I purchased this to help combat an ongoing acne problem with my son.  It is working well.  We have had it for only&lt;br /&gt;a short time, so the acne spots that have been around for years are slow in fading.  He is having very few new&lt;br /&gt;lesions.  I think these are showing up primarily because he isn&#x27;t careful enough in cleansing.  Many of the red&lt;br /&gt;spots are fading and have become very small.  This is the ONLY product we have found that has actually helped&lt;br /&gt;this very problematic acne.  We have tried so many things over the years.  I am very grateful we found it.</li>
            <li> looooovee it finally don&#x27;t get razor burn</li>
            <li> This is great stuff for the rough spots on your body.  Works great on zits as well... softens them right up and takes out the red.</li>
            <li> Definitely more medicinal than an every day lotion.  Good to have in the medicine cabinet.  I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ve experienced all the amazing healing properties expressed by others, nonetheless it has been good for more challenging skin conditions my kids might have like eczema, etc.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream to compare it to Egyptian Magic. The product isa great moisturizer for dry skin. The jury is still out on it having miracle curing. I&#x27;m still using it and will do a follow up review if I discover anything additional. I have no complaints but if I can find other products that treat dry skin that are less costly I will do so.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this a bit more than magic cream. Great product! This is a good as a day and night moisturizer .</li>
            <li> I tried this product after seeing it compared to Egyptian Magic. It&#x27;s comparable but I still prefer EM. This seems oilier, the ingredients are the same and it&#x27;s cheaper. I recommend purchasing a jar of each &amp; comparing for yourself. Any product containing royal jelly &amp; propolis is good for you, provided it&#x27;s all natural with no parabens, pthalates or other unhealthy ingredients. You may like this one. It&#x27;s a good, all natural product with many uses. I just prefer EM over this one.</li>
            <li> I ended up throwing away 1/2 the jar.  It did nothing for me.  I bought it for a psoriasis treatment and dry skin treatment.  The smell was not pleasant.  It almost smelled spoiled.  Will never buy again.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and it arrived on time</li>
            <li> I love this. It has really helped clear up my skin. I have combination skin with mild acne and rosacea. I was worried that some of the ingredients could clog my pores, but that hasn&#x27;t been the case. My skin also is less irritated from occasional glycolic acid and the Retin A and hydroquinone product I use on parts of my face every few days. I use a little of this with Skinceuticals Phytocorrective Gel and their vitamin c and e product at night. If I have a problem area, I use a tiny bit under my makeup. It&#x27;s a little greasy, but, thankfully, it works for me.</li>
            <li> to soften skin and relieve itching of Danier;s disease to some degree.  I bought this for my son as  the result of internet reviews of royal jelly.  He says that while it is no substitute for prescription meds, he feels that it definitely helps the itching.</li>
            <li> I wanted a cheaper alternative to L&#x27;Occitane&#x27;s pure Shea butter &amp; tried this product. It worked very well to moisturize my very dry skin, and I only needed to use it a few times a week.</li>
            <li> Really softens my skin.  Not greasy.</li>
            <li> Great product -- I&#x27;ve tried to make this myself but haven&#x27;t quite gotten the formula right and the supplies are expensive. Now I found this!  Sweeter and fresher honey fragrance (versus Egyptian Magic)...and it&#x27;s organic (Egyptian Magic isn&#x27;t)...and it&#x27;s significantly cheaper.  I paid $21 and usually pay about $30 for Egyptian Magic.</li>
            <li> I really like this product! It works out pretty well for my facial skin. I think that I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Definitely keeps the skin moisturized and smooth.  As always a little bit goes a long way. I put it on very thin after showering for the day, then put my make up on about 5 minutes later. At night (before bed) I wash my face and apply it a little thicker.. Your skin will look great in the morning.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I have chronically dry skin and chapped peeling lips despite how much water I drink. This has been a huge help for my lips and is a great facial moisturizer! It takes a bit to sink in but works great after that. I still haven&#x27;t found anything that works as well for my dry hands though.</li>
            <li> I always look for a rich but absorbable cream during winter in mid west.&lt;br /&gt;Till now, it is the best!!! Will buy more, and my skin looks much younger.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  When nothing else worked, this cream/gel/miracle worker has helped the stitches around my heal.  I also use it on my lips and cuticles. It&#x27;s worth every cent.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so very soft after using for just a week!</li>
            <li> After reading all of the great reviews,  I was pretty excited about trying this product.  It felt good, but it did nothing to help heal my rash.  I think shea butter and cocoa butter are just as good, so I am not able to recommend this product at this price.  Sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a mercury poisoning rash from the curly CFL bulbs formerly in my desk lamp where I work around 6 - 8 hours each day.  I have been chelating with herbs to get the mercury out of my blood and organs, and the original rash which indicated my blood was dirty, turned into a much itchier and raw rash as the toxins worked their way out of my body through my skin.  The Bee Magic felt good, but so did shea butter and cocoa butter, so it really wasn&#x27;t worth the extra money.  I would use it again, but not at the big price that is charged for it, although I felt comforted knowing how natural it is.</li>
            <li> It is everything it claims to be and more.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> No…it&#x27;s not hot, I just put this $… on everything! I dab it on my face, not rub it in, use it on my knees and elbows, cracked heals before I put on socks…hangnails…it&#x27;s really a wonderful moisturizer.  It does have an aroma, not pungent, just earthy and very mellow.  I don&#x27;t scoop any out, just run my fingertip around on top and dab wherever I need moisture.  It will likely last a very long time, so for me it&#x27;s worth the price. No chemicals to worry about either, which is super important to me…your skin is your largest organ and anything you put on it goes to your bloodstream…that&#x27;s why I like natural products.  This seller also shipped quickly, I&#x27;d recommend both this product and the seller.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff! Not thick but light and effective. My husband has been using cortisone for years for his seborrhea and this is now replacing the cortisone.</li>
            <li> I adore this stuff! I have reactive skin, always breaking out at the drop of a hat, and this seems to keep it under control somehow. It soothes and heals everything. I have quite a few other lotions/ointments with very similar ingredients (Honey Girl, Egyptian Magic, Africa&#x27;s Secret, etc), but none work as well as this does.  I don&#x27;t ever want to be without it. It&#x27;s the only thing that keeps my skin under control.</li>
            <li> I have dry flaky skin and using Retin A doesn&#x27;t help my flaking issues. When I wear makeup it looks worse and piles on the dead skin, which looks gross. I have tried pulling the skin off, exfoliating, lots of lotions, potions, oils, and even straight vitamin E 70,000 iu, nothing really worked. Until this magic in a jar. This works! It is amazing, the smell is a little different, but not strong at all. I use this on my face, my son&#x27;s chapped lips, and my husband and daughters cracked skin. It heals, protects, and keeps everything soft. I will keep this on subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have ever felt I wanted to write a review for. It is exactly what it says it is, Sweet BLESSED Bee Magic! I get horrible eczema breakouts. I had a bad breakout for a month and this cream healed in within a week, no joke. I have been using the cream for over 2 weeks before writing this review. I have tried dozens of natural remedies: coconut oil, lanolin, neem oil, just to name a few.  Medicine Mama&#x27;s Apothecary Sweet Blessed Bee Magic Cream is the only product that has worked for me. It’s soothing, hydrating, calming, healing, and protective. It soaks in within seconds and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily, just soft and comfortable. A little goes a long way. It smells faintly like olive oil and honey which I find pleasant and my husband doesn&#x27;t complain about it. Bonus, this cream is organic! I finally feel comfortable in my skin in over 2 years. PLEASE don’t ever stop making this truly wonderful product! Thank you and God bless you!</li>
            <li> You should stop what you&#x27;re buying and buy this for your kids skin rashes.  Do not put other garbage on them.  This is pure and natural and feels good and you could probably eat it.  If you cannot eat what you put on your skin, don&#x27;t use it.  Your skin is a sponge for all the chemicals you use.  I&#x27;m glad these guys came along and competed with the Egyptian Magic because the price war means consumers win.</li>
            <li> Bought this because i wanted an organic version of Egyptian Magic and I love it! After a couple of days my skin felt so plump and its been helping redness. My husband even started using it after he saw the difference in my skin and he has very sensitive skin that gets dry and flaky and rashy sometimes if he uses the wrong products. It has a distinctive odor, but so does egyptian magic.</li>
            <li> Natural ingredients, soaks in well after shower, (a little goes a long way),  I mostly use it on my face and neck and am experimenting using it on the tips of my flyaway hair.&lt;br /&gt;The price is good value too. it. Others mention a smell, I call it not adding a chemical fragrance, thank you. I don&#x27;t mind it, it&#x27;s not strong at all and fades quickly after application. I tried Egyptian Magic but I like this one better.&lt;br /&gt;I have several friends who now use it due to my recommend and I plan on continuing to use it too.</li>
            <li> I live in AZ where it&#x27;s very dry and this is great for dry skin!  Good value also.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> This product works very well for hand and body; however after putting it on my facial skin for 2-3 days, my face broke out like a teenager!!  I am 47 and not used to pimples!!  This product really clogged my pores!  It took me over 2 weeks to get my skin to settle back down.  I still like the product for hands, heels, etc, but I would highly discourage others from using it as a facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this as a winter night cream. Even though it looks like a thick Vaseline and is greasy at first, it absorbs really quickly and does not cause me to break out. I might continue to use as a night cream after winter.</li>
            <li> A very soothing and healing cream. My skin likes it. I would recommend it to anyone who wanted a healing cream, with good vibes.</li>
            <li> Amazing.  The best product.</li>
            <li> reviews I read were mostly good, sounded like what I was looking for. But the product is very sticky, and does not absorb into my skin. I can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> My sons have eczema, and many of the lotions -- even those marked specifically for eczema -- burn them.  So, I tried this, and it&#x27;s great.  It doesn&#x27;t bother either of my sons, and I&#x27;m even able to put it on their faces.  I love knowing it&#x27;s natural.  I use it as well on my rough heels and as lip balm.  We will buy more when this is gone, although I expect it to last a while.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good on my dry hands, however, it&#x27;s too greasy to put on your face, gets in your hair.....</li>
            <li> More like ointment,  it was a little disappointing that this is so heavy and it made my bangs so greasy I can only apply it at night</li>
            <li> Love this! It made my skin feel so soft and it cleared my skin. My skin looks soft and flawless!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I use it on my face at night.</li>
            <li> Yes, this is a bit greasy but I usually use it at night. I also put it on scrapes and burns. I do love that it doesn&#x27;t have added fragrance (which makes some people think that the product is rancid). Since only a tiny bit is needed, a jar lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> olive oil works just as well and is so much cheaper. the oil was rancid when i got it. i won&#x27;t be using it or buying it again</li>
            <li> I found egyptian magic on pinterest and people were raving about it. Then in the reviews people were saying how this product was better and less expensive. I agree! This product is less expensive and is all natural and organic! I use this on my face at night to hydrate while I sleep. Some other reviewers have noted that it doesn&#x27;t sink in for them. I have this same situation, it doesn&#x27;t sink in for me either, but it does work wonders. If my skin is tight, dry or itchy, all it takes is one use of this overnight and my skin is back to feeling and looking great. I haven&#x27;t noticed a decrease in any discoloration or scars on my skin, but it certainly is helping me keep my skin healthy!</li>
            <li> For years I have been trying to find a product that keeps my skin clear and helps clear up the breakouts I do have and this is the product! I have only broke out once since using it and it cleared that breakout up within a day! My skin is softer, clearer, and even some old scarring is fading away. I will definitely be using this for years to come!</li>
            <li> First, let me tell you that I abuse my face. I pop and scratch pimples all the time. I wear heavy make-up for long durations. I even go to sleep without washing off my make-up. My skin is not perfect. But when I feel bad about all of the abuse to my face, I just apply this cream to my face overnight for a week, and all is healed. At least until I begin abusing my face again. Some face wash dry out my skin and make it flakey, when I notice this happens, I use this cream overnight as well to treat it. When I wake up, I feel a noticeable difference. It is intimidating how greasy it looks at first, but it does soak into your skin after 20 minutes. I really think this is a great investment for beauty. If you have a few bucks to spare, I recommend you try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Immediate results&lt;br /&gt;Makes my skin smooth&lt;br /&gt;Heals dark spots from picking at my face&lt;br /&gt;Heals dark circles under eyes&lt;br /&gt;One jar lasts me months&lt;br /&gt;Good for dry skin&lt;br /&gt;Brings color back to my face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Can only use it at night or when I have free time at home&lt;br /&gt;Greasy so it is messy</li>
            <li> My chidren have ecezma and this really makes their skin soft. The main ingrediant is olive oil so if you dont like the smell of olive oil this may not be for you. Dont expect a honey smell. Its a bit pricey for just basically olive oil and beeswax. I found a recipe online where you can make something very similiar with olive oil, beeswax and coconut oil for alot cheaper. I would recommend this product if you dont mind spending so much for 4oz and you dont mind the smell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is magic but my skin does feel great. My only concern is the oxidation of the Olive oil in it. When oil oxidizes it creates free radicals and I am not sure what this does to the outside of the skin. Maybe they should make one with Coconut oil which oxidizes very slowly. This could be me over thinking  it but as far as a moisturizer it works exceptionally well. My favorite is the honey which contains all kinds of vitamins and enzymes great for skin which might offset the oxidized oil. I do have to say I have not had any breakouts whatsoever so it does not seem to clog pores.  I give it 4 stars which is near perfect.</li>
            <li> Use this just before bed, wake up soon feeling very smooth, and yes a little died go along way I should have this for awhile</li>
            <li> I have tried a handful of different moisturizers over the years. The Sweet Bee Magic cream is, by far, my favorite. It is a bit greasy (the main ingredient is Olive oil), but once it is applied to the skin, it is absorbed within 5-10 min and skin no longer feels oily. After using it for only a few days, I noticed that my pores are smaller and my skin is softer to touch in areas where I apply the cream. Even though the product is oily, I have not had a single pimple in areas where I have applied it (and my skin is prone to acne).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An important note: a little of this stuff goes a LONG way. A 4 oz. container should last for many applications (depending on how much of your body on which you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what it is worth, I am allergic to bee stings and I have not had any adverse reactions to this product. That being said, if you have a bee allergy you may consider consulting your physician/allergist before using this product as it does contain bees wax, bee pollen (technically from the flowers, but carried by bees) and royal jelly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it. Tried Sweet Bee and the Egyptian Magic and neither of them have any benefits for my skin. Both have negative reactions like skin peeling and dryness. I think EM is a little better on the quality if i had to choose but neither of them are worth buying to me. But it may work for others. Im african american. I have dry skin except my face which is combination. Ive used both in my hair, on my face and body and yes i went through each jar back to back. One SB and then the slightly better EM. I know when someone wants to try it, they will. But if i had to recommend it would be the EM for quality. But i technically am still giving both no stars.</li>
            <li> OK, so I know everyone raves about Egyptian Magic, but I&#x27;ve tried both, and I like Medicine Mama&#x27;s better. And not just because it&#x27;s cheaper! It seems to be more moisturizing. Egyptian Magic is paler, maybe a bit waxier, and just isn&#x27;t as good, in my opinion. I&#x27;ll be sticking with Medicine Mama&#x27;s from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a moisturizer to just put on whenever. I think it works best on &amp;#34;prepared&amp;#34; skin, i.e. on freshly scrubbed, immediately after a hot bath. Apply to barely damp skin, and rub it in very well. Take a few minutes and lie on a towel until it is absorbed. Yes, it&#x27;s a little oily, but if you have very dry skin, as I do, you&#x27;ll find the oiliness doesn&#x27;t last long. I only use it in the evening, because I don&#x27;t have time in the morning.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff.  This is a great value compared to retail stores.</li>
            <li> Good cream, but I wish it smelled better!</li>
            <li> This is basically identical to Egyptian magic, except that it&#x27;s all organic which EM is not, and it is significantly less expensive. Other reviews have said it has a \\&quot;sweet honey smell\\&quot; and I don&#x27;t find that to be true at all. The only reason I won&#x27;t give this 5 stars is because I find the smell unpleasant.  I don&#x27;t think there is even a slight honey smell to it. It&#x27;s not an unpleasant enough odor to prevent me from continuing to use it, but I do find the smell unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the scent.  Smells like honey, but not in a good way.</li>
            <li> It smells of beeswax and was too thick. I can&#x27;t even.</li>
            <li> I swear this stuff has gotten rid of my acne! I&#x27;ve been using it everyday on my face (usually overnight) and it&#x27;s fantastic. I had tried everything - I even used proactive for a couple of months right before this (i just ran out) and this cream worked BETTER than proactive... after only a couple of weeks. I had tried Egyptian Magic in the past but somehow it never gave me results this good. I have very oily, fair, sensitive, acne-prone skin. I only get the tiniest pimples occasionally now and they clear up super fast! I am really surprised and don&#x27;t plan on stopping using this Bee Magic!</li>
            <li> I was a long term user of Egyptian Magic and switched to this in November 2012 after reading many favorable reviews.  I liked it a lot, did what Egyptian Magic did.  Just bought another bottle and it reeks of rancid olive oil (unlike the first bottle).  It smell stays on my skin for a long time, going back to Egyptian Magic.</li>
            <li> Love it. Just bought more because I know my family is going to be using it like crazy during the dry months. At first, I was put off because it doesn&#x27;t smell good. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad either. I guess it just didn&#x27;t smell like I thought it would (honey). After you put it on it smells like ... nothing. Which is great if that&#x27;s what you want. It is greasy, but we put it on right after bath time before bed and I haven&#x27;t noticed any problem with it staining the sheets and it seems to absorb pretty quickly. I usually let me son choose which lotion he wants and he always chooses the &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; cream.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels great!!</li>
            <li> It is so smooth and silky. Helps with dryness due to thyroid condition. I use it several times a day on hands and face. Only negative is that flies and insects love it, including bees! Be aware that in warm weather, you might be chased by a swarm of bees or other insects!</li>
            <li> Purchased this cream based on the great reviews. It smells like slightly old olive oil. I tried it several times, on my hands, on my face during the night, and noticed no difference.</li>
            <li> If you have ever tried Egyptian magic you will love this. Especially since this is a little cheaper and the ingredients are organic. Unlike egyptian magic which doesn&#x27;t do organic and then have this explanation that says they don&#x27;t because they find some organic products are poorer quality than the normal  ingredients. Either way this product is the only thing that prevents my dry skin. It&#x27;s pretty thick and oily but not sticky. The smell is a bit like apples. Love this product.</li>
            <li> The shipping was very fast. Excellent packaging.&lt;br /&gt;After almost one week  using Bee Magic my skin is completely different, all of my friends and the people what i know , they said me my skin looks hydrated and I have a lot of glow...Is true!&lt;br /&gt;I have a very dry skin all over my body but especially on my feet, I put Bee Magic on my feet and all cracked and dry skin on my feet is gone!!&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend it also for the feet.&lt;br /&gt;Bee Magic is really magic!&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
            <li> it came early in the mail! and it is really good for your skin. Much cheaper than egyptian magic too. I suggest that you guys buy it :]</li>
