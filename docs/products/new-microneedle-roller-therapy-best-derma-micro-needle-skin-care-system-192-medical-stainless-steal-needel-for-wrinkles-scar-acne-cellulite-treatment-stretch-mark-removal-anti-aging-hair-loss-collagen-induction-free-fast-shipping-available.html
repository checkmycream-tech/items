            <li>I heard thatit is effective in dminishing acne scars.</li>
            <li>I also learned the product is effective in redcing wrinkle</li>
            <li>This one is really nice</li>

            <li>I am thrilled with this product and the results it provides</li>

            <li>I have research the product I fond that it is more effective if used with a vitamin c serum to help reduce scarring.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The quality of this product is excellent and it arrived in a very quick time even thought I live in Hawaii.</li>
            <li>I will probably continue to use this and see if there are better improvements.</li>

            <li>and i do love the results.</li>
            <li>However, I hurts more than I though it would.</li>
            <li>She said that after using the \\&quot;Roller Microneedle Therapy\\&quot; her skin is more flexible, and pigmentation on the skin that appeared after the pregnancy began to disappear.</li>
            <li>I have used it twice per week for 2 weeks and am noticing more skin elasticity already.  </li>
            <li>I am hoping to  increase the treatment to 3 times per week, so I can get better results.</li>
            <li>and I love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>The skin looks more even and feels smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not painful for me, more like pricks on the skin.</li>
            <li>roller rolls just fine</li>
            <li>Comfortable except around nose</li>
            <li>Once my skin is acne free, I roll every weekday in the evening.  </li>
            <li>I think this product is really worth the price!</li>
            <li>I was interested in trying a micro roller and this appeared to have good reviews from many different sources.</li>
            <li>It was not painful</li>
            <li>Wow  the microneedle roller is great make my skin look so much better and younger.</li>
            <li>I need much less makeup and love how good and glowy</li>
            <li>If I would&#x27;ve know it was so good, I would&#x27;ve saved a few grand.</li>
            <li>This one kept getting stuck after the first use and wouldn&#x27;t roll smoothly anymore.</li>
            <li>It feels very smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>The first time I did it, lightly, my face cleared up from the redness pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Origins) 3x daily, on top of Calcium Cream, on top of 1000 mg of Pure Vitamin E supplements each day</li>
            <li>but I do believe it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>SUPER FAST SHIPPING!  </li>
            <li>The needles come in different lengths so maybe I didn&#x27;t get one that is suitable for me.  </li>
            <li>It does come in a plastic box and seems easy enough to clean with alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And that was very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>At first, the reviews seemed to be a plant</li>
            <li>It tingles at first but you will get used to.</li>
            <li>It started to make some noises but the needles are still sharp and effective.</li>
            <li>I could not in good conscious give the product any less stars if I have never used it)</li>
            <li>but don&#x27;t push dine just gently roll over face .. Sanitize too</li>
            <li>Thanks to this person&#x27;s reply</li>
            <li>, I now believe that I may have had a rush to judgement and thus, the reviews may indeed be real.  </li>
            <li>Granted, this is an unusual product and is not for everyone.  </li>
            <li>The pain seems to be not as intense each time I use it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>If you are in fact an actual reviewer, I applaud you because most of the public depend on people like you to guide them on purchases.</li>
            <li>I think if I bought a more expensive brand it would have been better.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this purchase to anyone, to have better looking skin for such a minimum prize!</li>
            <li>Package arrived neatly packed and in super short time.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very pleased with my small investment.</li>
            <li>Deeper in turn diminish very clearly.</li>
            <li>Finally affordable product that really works!</li>
            <li>Finally affordable product that really works!</li>
            <li>I think the more harder you roll, the quicker and smoother your skin will become - as long as you also wipe alcohol swabs and apply lotion to the area after using this instrument.</li>
            <li>The next time I went a little more aggressive and 3 days later, my face is still red and super dry.</li>
            <li>It is quite annoying, but gets better the longer and more</li>
            <li>i bought the 540 one but returned because i felt like the needles were not sharp</li>
            <li>This may sound strange that the man uses a typical product for women.</li>
            <li>I still am not sure because I really can&#x27;t use it much.</li>
            <li>These smaller began to fade completely.</li>
            <li>The last thing I want to do is damage my skin, and this so far has left me wondering if I have done myself a disservice by trying this.</li>
            <li>I have now purchased a higher quality roller so this was just a waste of money.</li>
            <li>Overall seems sturdy and well worth the small price.</li>
            <li>I do not want to break the skin and have rolled it around a little, oh, so gently.  </li>

            <li> I can barely use this because it is so sharp.  </li>
            <li> It was little painfull at first but got used to it after few times using it.</li>
            <li> Gentlemen, if you are ashamed to go to the cosmetologist, or if you care about your appearance does not hesitate for long.</li>
            <li> Received well packaged and undamaged two days earlier then was expected.</li>
            <li> and my face is still dry.</li>
            <li> all the reviews seemed circumspect because of their respective posting dates (4 days of each other) and none of the reviewers had ever posted any other reviews.  </li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t rough to bear at all.  </li>
            <li> I was curious to see if it worked</li>
            <li> Even facial creams/moisturizers have specific directions, but this is made of micro needles that maybe harmful to the skin if used the wrong way and not properly cleaned.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I am using the Roller Therapy enough.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to ease up a bit and possibly do one side of my face a few times a week for a few weeks, and see if one side shows improvement.</li>
            <li> After using this for a week or so, I noticed that my pores around my nose have closed up a little.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if my skin has developed a pain tollerance or the needles dull.</li>
            <li> but I can see slight improvements.</li>
            <li> not cool since then</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still a little undecided.</li>
            <li> Being using this a few months now.</li>
            <li> Am still not sure about results from use yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks, usually once a day, and I&#x27;ve already sern an improvement.</li>
            <li> but I have seen small results.</li>
            <li> This hurts and is very uneven in the roller -</li>
            <li> The initial use of the Roller Therapy was painful.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even watch much because it was so gruesome.  </li>
            <li> NOT good as this causes unnecessary injuries!  </li>
            <li> Any type of pressure or speed would be painful and cause bleeding I believe.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Being using this a few months now. It is helping to rejuvenate my skin. It started to make some noises but the needles are still sharp and effective. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> How am I suppose to use this product if there&#x27;s no manual? Even facial creams/moisturizers have specific directions, but this is made of micro needles that maybe harmful to the skin if used the wrong way and not properly cleaned.If there&#x27;s no detail direction to use it I would be hesitant to try it.</li>
            <li> I was interested in trying a micro roller and this appeared to have good reviews from many different sources. I&#x27;m not sure how much it is improving my skin- but it&#x27;s not hurting (once you get over the initial &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; of the needles). I use it every 5 days- before bed and have never woken up with red irritated skin</li>
            <li> makes skin soo much younger LQQKING</li>
            <li> I bought this and used it for about a month but it started making squeaking sounds and the roller would get stuck while I was rolling it on my face--not cool since then the needles are just dragged across in a scratch motion instead of rolling.  Also, some of the needles ended up getting bent (mind you, I took good care of this needle roller).  I ended up throwing it away and purchasing one in the UK and having it sent to the US.</li>
            <li> It does work after weeks of usage. It was not painful and I did not need hte numbing cream. My skin has improved.</li>
            <li> I have only you this twice a week. It did not drastically change my skin but I can see slight improvements. I will probably continue to use this and see if there are better improvements.</li>
            <li> I purchased this, because I have had a problem with acne for YEARS!! After using this for a week or so, I noticed that my pores around my nose have closed up a little. I think this product is really worth the price! A+! :)</li>
            <li> Needles are inconsistent in length. Also some are bent. I have now purchased a higher quality roller so this was just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I received this a week before I was scheduled to get botox.  If I would&#x27;ve know it was so good, I would&#x27;ve saved a few grand. I love it!!</li>
            <li> Ihave not used theproduct yet. I heard thatit is effective in dminishing acne scars.I currently have a break out.One my skin heal I plan to use the product. i will update you on whether it works or not. I have research the product I fond that it is more effective if used with a vitamin c serum to help reduce scarring. I also learned the product is effective in redcing wrinkle</li>
            <li> i bought the 540 one but returned because i felt like the needles were not sharp and i was just scratching my skin. This one is really nice and i do love the results.</li>
            <li> Very happy with it and think its pretty darn close to the $100 one Roden &amp; Fields sells . Comfortable except around nose but don&#x27;t push dine just gently roll over face .. Sanitize too</li>
            <li> No directions in box?  SUPER FAST SHIPPING!  I suggest using smaller needles to start - this baby HURTS.  Overall seems sturdy and well worth the small price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still a little undecided. The first time I did it, lightly, my face cleared up from the redness pretty quickly. The next time I went a little more aggressive and 3 days later, my face is still red and super dry. Been using very good moisturizer (Origins) 3x daily, on top of Calcium Cream, on top of 1000 mg of Pure Vitamin E supplements each day and my face is still dry. I&#x27;m debating on whether this helps or harms your face. The last thing I want to do is damage my skin, and this so far has left me wondering if I have done myself a disservice by trying this. I&#x27;m going to ease up a bit and possibly do one side of my face a few times a week for a few weeks, and see if one side shows improvement. If not...I&#x27;m throwing this away.</li>
            <li> Wanted to buy this item and try it out because I thought it looked just like the more expensive Rodan and Fields micro needle ($150.00) for a fraction of the price. Am still not sure about results from use yet.</li>
            <li> Stop reading and push &#x27;buy now&#x27; button.&lt;br /&gt;It works. Just do it. Using this for 4 1/2 weeks, definitely seeing results.</li>
            <li> Very good service and product.</li>
            <li> Arrived with bent needle.  I clipped them off easily enough. HOWEVER.... roller rolls just fine when &amp;#34;pushing&amp;#34; forward. However when pulling across the skin, the plastic on the side of the roller (holding the needles) snags on the handle and pulls the skin.  NOT good as this causes unnecessary injuries!  This one will be sitting in its box!</li>
            <li> I stand corrected on my initial observation.  I received a reply to my post from someone who appears to be an actual reviewer of this product. When I was about to purchase this product all the reviews seemed circumspect because of their respective posting dates (4 days of each other) and none of the reviewers had ever posted any other reviews.  At first, the reviews seemed to be a plant so I did not purchase the product.  Thanks to this person&#x27;s reply, I now believe that I may have had a rush to judgement and thus, the reviews may indeed be real.  I am now again considering purchasing this product. My apologies to all the reviewers.  If you are in fact an actual reviewer, I applaud you because most of the public depend on people like you to guide them on purchases. (BTW: I gave this 5 stars because I had to rate it even though I have never used the product - I could not in good conscious give the product any less stars if I have never used it)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how but it works. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks, usually once a day, and I&#x27;ve already sern an improvement.</li>
            <li> I think the more harder you roll, the quicker and smoother your skin will become - as long as you also wipe alcohol swabs and apply lotion to the area after using this instrument.</li>
            <li> This hurts and is very uneven in the roller - I don&#x27;t see any difference after use so I gave up.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times but I have seen small results. However, I hurts more than I though it would.</li>
            <li> I think if I bought a more expensive brand it would have been better. This one kept getting stuck after the first use and wouldn&#x27;t roll smoothly anymore.</li>
            <li> I can barely use this because it is so sharp.  I do not want to break the skin and have rolled it around a little, oh, so gently.  Any type of pressure or speed would be painful and cause bleeding I believe.  I watched part of a YouTube video that included bleeding -- just not my thing at all.  I couldn&#x27;t even watch much because it was so gruesome.  I like the idea of stimulating collagen and that is why I bought this.  It does come in a plastic box and seems easy enough to clean with alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously, I tried one of these rollers on my hand at a salon and it wasn&#x27;t rough to bear at all.  The needles come in different lengths so maybe I didn&#x27;t get one that is suitable for me.  Granted, this is an unusual product and is not for everyone.  I was curious to see if it worked and I would see visible results.  I still am not sure because I really can&#x27;t use it much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using dermaroller on and off for 5 months.  I suffer from a lot of acne scars and occasional under-the-skin acne.  I&#x27;ve tried many products, and this is the best of the best!  Once my skin is acne free, I roll every weekday in the evening.  Within 1 week, all my scars have greatly reduced.  I need much less makeup and love how good and glowy my skin looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not painful for me, more like pricks on the skin. I let it sit in isopropyl alcohol (90%) after every use or spritz it with isopropyl alcohol to ensure it&#x27;s sanitary. After 1 hour I moisturize my skin with 100% argon oil and sometimes hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li> This may sound strange that the man uses a typical product for women. But I wanted to share with you how it happened that I decided to try to work this product. I saw my wife is using a \\&quot;Roller Microneedle Therapy.\\&quot; I was wondering if it helps her. She said that after using the \\&quot;Roller Microneedle Therapy\\&quot; her skin is more flexible, and pigmentation on the skin that appeared after the pregnancy began to disappear. I personally started to use the \\&quot;Roller Microneedle Therapy\\&quot; three weeks ago, which focused on my forehead where I have a lot of wrinkles. These smaller began to fade completely. Deeper in turn diminish very clearly. I would recommend above all for women. Gentlemen, if you are ashamed to go to the cosmetologist, or if you care about your appearance does not hesitate for long.</li>
            <li> No manual was included in box as indicated on it.&lt;br /&gt;How should I get this&lt;br /&gt;Please help&lt;br /&gt;Would like to use product.&lt;br /&gt;What serums should I use with it&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for feedback everyone!!</li>
            <li> This actually works! It hurts a bit but I do believe it&#x27;s worth it. I put a serum on afterwards and my skin has shown a lot of improvement (and only after two weeks)!</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I am using the Roller Therapy enough.  I believe my pores have shrunken a bit.  I still see the hyperpigmentation that I&#x27;m trying to get rid of.  Once that problem has cleared up, I will give it a 5 star.  The initial use of the Roller Therapy was painful.  The pain seems to be not as intense each time I use it.  I am not sure if my skin has developed a pain tollerance or the needles dull.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very pleased with my small investment. I have used it twice per week for 2 weeks and am noticing more skin elasticity already.  Where I have seen a big improvement is on my cheeks. It feels very smooth and soft.  The pain is almost tolerable while rolling across the face. It is quite annoying, but gets better the longer and more you do it. I am hoping to  increase the treatment to 3 times per week, so I can get better results. The roller itself cleans very easily. I would definitely recommend this purchase to anyone, to have better looking skin for such a minimum prize!</li>
            <li> OMG! I love this product!!! I tried a couple times and my face is glowing, improved scars, smoother, and skin looking younger !!! Finally affordable product that really works! And that was very fast shipping. LOve it , love it, love it !!!!</li>
            <li> My fiend convinced me to buy 5 micro needle rollers so I bought it. Now I know that I&#x27;m not done with buying.&lt;br /&gt;I like my skin after using this product. It looks like the roller reducing the appearance of aging on my face and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of this product is excellent and it arrived in a very quick time even thought I live in Hawaii.</li>
            <li> Received well packaged and undamaged two days earlier then was expected. The quality is durable and has it&#x27;s own holder for storage or travel. It tingles at first but you will get used to. I have seen results after just two weeks in acne scars, the smoothness of my skin,and my pores seem smaller. Finally affordable product that really works! I would definitely recommend this derma roller to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this derma roller for about two weeks now and I can visibly see results. The skin looks more even and feels smooth. It was little painfull at first but got used to it after few times using it. I highly recommend it!</li>
