            <li>The quick delivery was a pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;The soap is everything I have been looking for all my life.</li>
            <li>Since I love the oil, I had to try the soap</li>
            <li>I love it for me and my son.  </li>
            <li>Too many toxins in our world.</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>What I like most about it is that it seems to rinse off better than most soaps</li>
            <li>, this dries my skin out more than most.  </li>

            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I add the coconut oil soap to my regular soap and my skin looks great!</li>
            <li>Rinses off easily with no soapy residue.</li>
            <li>, It is soapy and rinses out easy.</li>
            <li>I love this soap and use it myself and on my two littles, lathers great and only 3 ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Dawn Dishwashing Liquid works on grease stains too, but it has a strong scent which I do not like.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It would be nice if more sellers and advertisers realised how many citric acid reactive people there are in this world, and labelled their offers accordingly.</li>
            <li>This may be great for household cleaning, but it&#x27;s too strong for personal uses.</li>
            <li>I am a HUGE FAN of coconut products.  </li>
            <li>It is light weight and odorless.  </li>
            <li>I used this in the shower and it was creamy and light.</li>
            <li>This is a nice gentle soap.  </li>
            <li>The shipper was also fantastic as the package arrived destroyed and leaking</li>
            <li>Simple ingredients, great lather, it can be used for anything.  </li>
            <li>Keeps winter skin moist and smooth.</li>
            <li>It lathers surprisingly well for looking like water, It does burn my face if left on for more than 10 seconds.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We found it works best to put it in a foaming dispenser half-full of the soap and half full of water.</li>
            <li>I take one that I have bought before and clean it out well.</li>
            <li>I feel clean but not stripped.</li>
            <li>Big bottle, no scent, lathers good.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good simple soap during pregnancy</li>
            <li>.. Makes you feel super clean..</li>
            <li>I think coconut milk tastes like sweat squeezed out of socks, but this stuff is just fine on on top of my head, removing dirt but leaving natural</li>
            <li>I purchased this item to replace my coconut bar soap which withers away quickly.  </li>
            <li>When I was pregnant I became highly sensitive to smells and was so glad I found this soap.  </li>
            <li>I love the sensitive formula of Nutra biotic makes been using it for 2 years now.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has no thickening agents so it can spill right out of your hands.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced too!</li>
            <li>and I do not have to bother wetting my hands first.  </li>
            <li>This is the first liquid soap that&#x27;s worked for all of us.</li>
            <li>I was looking for natural cleanser, this fit the bill</li>
            <li>it is still exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I had been looking for more natural products to use that contain only a couple of natural ingredients and this one fit the bill for me.</li>
            <li>I advise for anyone with sensitive skin and needs a mild like cleanser..</li>
            <li>My thought was a large bottle of a liquid coconut soap</li>
            <li>I bought a large jug and it&#x27;s stayed fresh for quite a while so far.</li>
            <li>I was surprised about how useful it is and very gentile as well.    </li>
            <li>This has really done wonders for her.</li>
            <li>Better than expected.</li>
            <li>Really cleans up pores and problem areas.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It is a good product, any soap can be harsh on fragile skin, it is the nature of soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving this so far--it lathers even in our tough water, has no intrusive scent, seems mild to my sensitive skin, and can be used for hair and body.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and ingredients, but it&#x27;s a little runny.</li>
            <li>a tiny bit goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: still love it but tried it in the shower and as a shampoo.</li>
            <li>and they immediately sent a new one which arrived in days as a replacement.  </li>
            <li>No waste!  </li>
            <li>I think this is normal, I just didn&#x27;t know what to expect as far as thickness goes.</li>
            <li>I also do not let it sit, but put the garment directly in the washer for a normal wash cycle after treating.  </li>
            <li>Use this on sore spots and clear them up within a minute or so.  </li>
            <li>Remember: &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; means the natural oil in your hair has been removed.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not harsh.</li>
            <li>Not bad just slight.</li>
            <li>I remove it from its original container and put it in a pump bottle; less waste.</li>

            <li> I remove it from its original container and put it in a pump bottle; less waste.</li>
            <li> I was using dermatologist recommended skin cleansers full of chemicals that left my skin looking shallow and feeling dry til the coconut oil was applied.</li>
            <li> As advertised, it really suds up when applied and only takes a small amount.</li>
            <li> With that being said, I will purchase this product from now on as long as the ingredients list doesn&#x27;t change.</li>
            <li> But her hands are not broken out anymore, like how they were on other soaps she has used in the past......</li>
            <li> My Mother has Psoriasis, and her Dermatologist told her to pick up Coconut Oil Soap, and to only use this instead of any other soap.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have an odr, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin</li>
            <li> I use this as a baby wash on my newborn and it does not irritate his skin however it did seem to dry out his scalp when I used it to wash his hair, so i switched to a shea butter shampoo and conditioner for him.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin</li>
            <li> I dilute it about half water to half soap and put it in a pointy plastic condiment dispenser to easily direct the soap onto the stains.  </li>
            <li> I am 64 years old and have always had bad skin but thanks to discovering this product for bathing and cleansing my face and using virgin coconut oil for moisturizing, my skin glows like never before!!  </li>
            <li> I doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling dry and tight with a soapy smell.</li>
            <li> I use a fairly small amount of it in water in my foaming hand soap dispensers, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I bought this product previously and this was a re-order of this product.  </li>
            <li> Within a week of using this, my face has visibly cleared up, it&#x27;s pretty crazy.</li>
            <li> Be cautious and spot test on a hidden part of your clothing before treating stains as I have found some fabrics will bleach out a little bit after spot treating.</li>
            <li> Leaked a little in package when delivered.</li>
            <li> ordering  the little travel size ....</li>
            <li> It has a very thin liquid consistency, so be aware when pouring that it&#x27;s not as thick as you might expect.</li>
            <li> Also, it will stay on the hands so that the little ones will not have trouble with the liquid soap running through their fingers.  </li>
            <li> It must be directly applied to the area to be cleaned vs hand application, if one doesn&#x27;t want to waste this expensive soap.</li>
            <li> It drains through fingers and is wasted.  </li>
            <li> Its hard to hold the bottle with one hand and dispense it in the other hand without it all running off your hand or between your fingers.</li>
            <li> Takes a little adjustment to use it compared to other shower gels as this is quite a thin liquid but</li>
            <li> I do not have a bad reaction to citric acid, so this products works very well for me.</li>
            <li> One negative-</li>
            <li> We are slowly reducing our toxic load.</li>
            <li> arrived with a broken cap and a portion of the product wasted.  </li>
            <li> To thin and watery to use plus it stung in those delicate areas.</li>
            <li> She said that the coconut oil will help to heal her badly broken out hands.</li>
            <li> It is the base of the soaps to which I add my essential oils.</li>
            <li> and I think there should be a warning listed, at least in the description, because I do have a friend who has bad reactions to citric acid as well.</li>
            <li> What a bargain when you consider all the expensive products it replaces.</li>
            <li> I like it, even if it is expensive.  </li>
            <li> It has a consistency of water very thin.</li>
            <li> Suffers from sensitve skin condition on her hands and something in it or the processing set her hands on fire I will use it or give it away.</li>

            <li> I stumbled upon this product and am now a fan! I use it on my hand washables and it cleans them perfectly, I also noted that it is a great stain lifter as well. The best thing about this product is it is safer for the environment.</li>
            <li> My Mother has Psoriasis, and her Dermatologist told her to pick up Coconut Oil Soap, and to only use this instead of any other soap. She said that the coconut oil will help to heal her badly broken out hands. This has really done wonders for her. She is of course on medication for her skin disease. But her hands are not broken out anymore, like how they were on other soaps she has used in the past...... Great product....</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with this product. Reasonably priced too!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product--those that have allergies, it is a saver. Delivery was spot on.</li>
            <li> I am 64 years old and have always had bad skin but thanks to discovering this product for bathing and cleansing my face and using virgin coconut oil for moisturizing, my skin glows like never before!!  It lathers wonderfully!  Takes a little adjustment to use it compared to other shower gels as this is quite a thin liquid but sooooo worth the effort for the great benefits.  LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!  And my husband has discovered he loves it too.  We even use it as a shampoo!  I will be buying the gallon size from now on. What a bargain when you consider all the expensive products it replaces.</li>
            <li> Lathers well. Works as shampoo as well.  Leaked a little in package when delivered.</li>
            <li> I use in my hand soaps. Works great!</li>
            <li> Since I love the oil, I had to try the soap and it&#x27;s almost gone already! I love it for me and my son.  It is light weight and odorless.  It lathers so well that you only need to put it on your cloth once.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL UNSCENTED SOAP WITH COCONUT OIL THAT MOISTURIZES AS IT CLEANS AND FIGHTS SUN FUNGUS ON MY SKIN AS IT IS ANTIBACTERIAL AND ANTI FUNGAL.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use laurel sulfate on what is left of my hair. Usually warm water and a scratchy-scrub keep my hair in looking good, in good health, and with body. Remember: &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; means the natural oil in your hair has been removed. But occasionally my hair gets enough dust or debris in it that I use this product. I think coconut milk tastes like sweat squeezed out of socks, but this stuff is just fine on on top of my head, removing dirt but leaving natural oils.&lt;br /&gt;It has no thickening agents so it can spill right out of your hands. I remove it from its original container and put it in a pump bottle; less waste.</li>
            <li> Better than expected. It works well and it&#x27;s not harsh. I used this in the shower and it was creamy and light. I see that some people use it to make cleaning products. I  might try that too. We are slowly reducing our toxic load. Too many toxins in our world.</li>
            <li> This is a nice gentle soap.  It is good to put in a bottle with a top that creates foam.  I take one that I have bought before and clean it out well. There is no need to add water to the bottle.  I keep it by the sink and I do not have to bother wetting my hands first.  Also, it will stay on the hands so that the little ones will not have trouble with the liquid soap running through their fingers.  No waste!  I have a bottle by the kitchen and one in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Love it...lathers well ...update in a week or so for final results</li>
            <li> Needs a thickener, but otherwise good.</li>
            <li> Seems o.k  Some of the reviews don&#x27;t match my experience with the product.....  Someone mentioned it leaving a film in their tub or shower. I have not had that happen.  It has a consistency of water very thin. Its hard to hold the bottle with one hand and dispense it in the other hand without it all running off your hand or between your fingers. I ended up putting it in a wall mounted dispenser, which works.  It lathers surprisingly well for looking like water, It does burn my face if left on for more than 10 seconds. Not bad just slight. Nothing visible when rinsed off.  Didn&#x27;t know coconut oil would do that but I see there is citric acid in it as well.  What I like most about it is that it seems to rinse off better than most soaps so you don&#x27;t feel like its still on your skin after your shower. One negative- I assumed because it is &#x27;coconut oil&#x27; that it would have some moisturizing affect. Nope not at all, this dries my skin out more than most.  But I still like it  enough that I will buy it again when it runs out.  I just use a moisturizer after which I always had to do anyway.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and ingredients, but it&#x27;s a little runny.</li>
            <li> In our family we have lots of skin and odor sensitivities. This is the first liquid soap that&#x27;s worked for all of us. It doesn&#x27;t have an odr, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, it doesn&#x27;t flare up someone else&#x27;s eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We found it works best to put it in a foaming dispenser half-full of the soap and half full of water.</li>
            <li> Big bottle, no scent, lathers good. I didn&#x27;t expect it to be so thin/runny so I will buy a thickening agent to go in my soap. I think this is normal, I just didn&#x27;t know what to expect as far as thickness goes.</li>
            <li> I use it in my hair too.  Rinses off easily with no soapy residue.</li>
            <li> To thin and watery to use plus it stung in those delicate areas. I love the sensitive formula of Nutra biotic makes been using it for 2 years now. I won&#x27;t ever switch again</li>
            <li> Bar soap requires 5-8 rinses to remove soap.  1-2 rinses with this soap.  Really cleans up pores and problem areas.  Use this on sore spots and clear them up within a minute or so.  I like it, even if it is expensive.  As others have said, this soap has the consistency of water.  It drains through fingers and is wasted.  It must be directly applied to the area to be cleaned vs hand application, if one doesn&#x27;t want to waste this expensive soap.</li>
            <li> I bought this product previously and this was a re-order of this product.  The shipper was also fantastic as the package arrived destroyed and leaking and they immediately sent a new one which arrived in days as a replacement.  great product!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I had been looking for more natural products to use that contain only a couple of natural ingredients and this one fit the bill for me. I love coconut oil which I use after showers/baths, so I thought this would be a great companion to that. Well, it has no scent, which is great, and lathers up quite well despite the watery consistency. I do not have a bad reaction to citric acid, so this products works very well for me. I have used this coconut oil soap to shampoo my hair and wash my face with no problems. However, I have noticed in the reviews that some have had reactions to the citric acid and I think there should be a warning listed, at least in the description, because I do have a friend who has bad reactions to citric acid as well. With that being said, I will purchase this product from now on as long as the ingredients list doesn&#x27;t change.</li>
            <li> I am a HUGE FAN of coconut products.  I purchased this item to replace my coconut bar soap which withers away quickly.  My thought was a large bottle of a liquid coconut soap would go further.  When I saw the word &#x27;Oil&#x27; used in the description of this product I believed it was of a thicker consistency.  The liquid is close to water in consistency and it doesn&#x27;t suds up enough for my liking.</li>
            <li> A great buy for some great soap.</li>
            <li> I love this soap for tooth brushing &amp; facewashing</li>
            <li> I use this to successfully to remove grease stains from laundry.  I tried it when I found that Heritage House discontinued their Washout product which was coconut based.  Be cautious and spot test on a hidden part of your clothing before treating stains as I have found some fabrics will bleach out a little bit after spot treating. I dilute it about half water to half soap and put it in a pointy plastic condiment dispenser to easily direct the soap onto the stains.  This seems to alleviate the bleaching problem for the most part.  I also do not let it sit, but put the garment directly in the washer for a normal wash cycle after treating.  Dawn Dishwashing Liquid works on grease stains too, but it has a strong scent which I do not like.</li>
            <li> Great shower soap .leave you skin feeling great</li>
            <li> Great Soap!!  Simple ingredients, great lather, it can be used for anything.  I was looking for a good simple soap during pregnancy and I came across this in the health food store.  I was surprised about how useful it is and very gentile as well.    If you like this soap - you may also like - [[ASIN:B004284VWO Ah Shayh - Organic Unrefined Virgin Coconut Oil (Glass Jar)]]</li>
            <li> Suffers from sensitve skin condition on her hands and something in it or the processing set her hands on fire I will use it or give it away.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this soap.. Makes you feel super clean.. I advise for anyone with sensitive skin and needs a mild like cleanser..</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Truly unscented. It has a very thin liquid consistency, so be aware when pouring that it&#x27;s not as thick as you might expect. I use a fairly small amount of it in water in my foaming hand soap dispensers, a little goes a long way. I bought a large jug and it&#x27;s stayed fresh for quite a while so far.</li>
            <li> This may be great for household cleaning, but it&#x27;s too strong for personal uses. I used this as a face wash twice and burned my skin, honestly!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I will buy again. As advertised, it really suds up when applied and only takes a small amount. t also works for the reason I purchased it which was to help alleviate itching from severe eczema.</li>
            <li> I was looking for natural cleanser, this fit the bill, It is soapy and rinses out easy. I also used it for my hair.</li>
            <li> This soap lathers up really nicely and cleans even better. I love how it has no scent. I doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling dry and tight with a soapy smell. This is some good stuff.</li>
            <li> leaked in shipping.  arrived with a broken cap and a portion of the product wasted.  This is a liquidy and does not lather well.</li>
            <li> This is a good foaming soap, and like all coconut oil soaps, gets the grime off easily. However if you are one of the thousands of people reactive to citric acid, this product has citric acid as an ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be nice if more sellers and advertisers realised how many citric acid reactive people there are in this world, and labelled their offers accordingly.</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  Keeps winter skin moist and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this so far--it lathers even in our tough water, has no intrusive scent, seems mild to my sensitive skin, and can be used for hair and body.</li>
            <li> I love this soap, great service</li>
            <li> When I was pregnant I became highly sensitive to smells and was so glad I found this soap.  It is truly unscented and has no smell.  I love this soap and use it myself and on my two littles, lathers great and only 3 ingredients.  I use this as a baby wash on my newborn and it does not irritate his skin however it did seem to dry out his scalp when I used it to wash his hair, so i switched to a shea butter shampoo and conditioner for him.  I follow up after bath with coconut oil.  It is truly unscented and has no smell which I love.</li>
            <li> This product arrived at my door almost before I clicked the submit order button. The quick delivery was a pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;The soap is everything I have been looking for all my life. I tossed out all my lotions and potions and use only coconut oil on my skin. It is wonderful. I was using dermatologist recommended skin cleansers full of chemicals that left my skin looking shallow and feeling dry til the coconut oil was applied. This soap is very gentle and lathers beautifully. I feel clean but not stripped. It is perfect for preparing my skin for the coconut oil and I am going to order the gallon size next.&lt;br /&gt;Try ordering  the little travel size ....it will convince you.&lt;br /&gt;Oh...a tiny bit goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: still love it but tried it in the shower and as a shampoo. For me this doesn&#x27;t work. Hair was oily afterwards and the tub and walls are coated with oily sludge. As a hand and face wash it is still exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I keep re ordering. It is the base of the soaps to which I add my essential oils. It is a good product, any soap can be harsh on fragile skin, it is the nature of soap. Dilute or add a bit of coconut oil, jojoba or olive oil to soften the soap.I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Within a week of using this, my face has visibly cleared up, it&#x27;s pretty crazy. I have sleeves, and I tend to break out when I&#x27;m working out in the sun, but this coconut oil soap clears that up too. I&#x27;m buying another bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this soap! Smells good! Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have extremely dry skin and I add the coconut oil soap to my regular soap and my skin looks great!</li>
