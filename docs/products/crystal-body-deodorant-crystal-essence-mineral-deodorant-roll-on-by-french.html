            <li>Love the smelll!!!</li>
            <li>Has an excellent smell to it &amp; works great at controlling odor throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered this one and the unscented and both work great.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Smells great and works well.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for about 3 weeks now, I am loving it!</li>
            <li>:P  </li>
            <li>Does the job and has a pleasant odor.</li>
            <li>But then I discovered it&#x27;s way better to make my own by mixing together coconut &amp; shea butter, baking soda and tea tree oil and voila, best deodorant out there.</li>
            <li>I have used it before and loved it.</li>
            <li>Important to follow the instructions on the bottle to get the best benefits.</li>
            <li>I liked this for a year or two, for a &#x27;happy deodorant&#x27;</li>
            <li>When I work out, I sweat, but that&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li>The smell is just perfect - light and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Great product, nice to have some &amp;#34;scents&amp;#34; for a mineral salt deodorant.  </li>
            <li>This smells even better than the lavender/white tea version!</li>
            <li>I read all kinds of reviews but most of the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; rated products were costly, like $18.00 per bottle!  </li>
            <li>My favorite out of all the scents!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to hold up to that kind of activity.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product because it does not have triclosan (a carcinogenic used it many deodorants and sanitizing soaps today) and it is not an antiperspirant (sweating is good for you).</li>
            <li>Also, the.chamomile scent is nice, depending on what you like.</li>
            <li>I love the crystal deodorant cause they smell nice</li>
            <li>This scent most effective.</li>
            <li>but I am very impressed so far.</li>
            <li>This was shipped very quickly!</li>
            <li>The scent is mild and pleasant, not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the lavender and pomegranate scents of Crystal and this one is by far the most pleasant!  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>ok.  </li>
            <li>Could have had more fragrance IMO.</li>
            <li>It has a nice, light aroma, plus It doesn&#x27;t leave a film in my pits or clothing.</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant - I ususally don&#x27;&#x27;t like liquid deodorants because it leaves your underarm</li>
            <li>This seems to keep everything at bay, I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite deodorant</li>
            <li>Anything is better than Tom&#x27;s of Maine which does nothing for me</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I am reviewing these appropriately on how they help eliminate the stink.  </li>
            <li>one is ok.  </li>
            <li>It acts more like a perfume.  </li>
            <li>but it was just &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;, working better in the colder months.  </li>
            <li>I went online to try to find something better.  </li>
            <li>Love this deodorant.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this smell.</li>
            <li>but I love this scent.</li>
            <li>But for normal activity, this one is great.  </li>
            <li>The chamomile/green tea keeps the pits smelling good for a whole day!</li>
            <li>It has a mild nice scent.  </li>
            <li>no rashes, no staining of my clothing, and most important safe for my body to use.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li>I was attracted to this deodorant due to the awesome scentâ€”</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t want one that had a strong smell.</li>
            <li>Iam 5&#x27;10 250lbs and this deodorant does just fine.</li>
            <li>and my body has adjusted fine.</li>
            <li>It comes fragrance free or you can find it in Chamomile or Lavender scents.  </li>
            <li>the smell is light  and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>We are odor free</li>
            <li>Did not keep either of us odor free all day.  </li>
            <li>I found the product to keep me odor free, even on the hottest days.  </li>
            <li>Good thought using all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Natural Ingredients good</li>
            <li>To me, the solid crystal rock is still the best, but this is a very close</li>
            <li>Fast Shipment!!!</li>
            <li>When I do have to rush and throw clothes on right after putting on the deodorant, it is still pretty effective, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any sort of staining on my clothes from it.    </li>
            <li>I love Crystal stick, but this the first with a scent.</li>
            <li>and dries clean like you have nothing on.</li>
            <li>The smell is fresh and light, so it does not interfere with the scent of perfume or lotions.</li>
            <li>I love the light smell of this deodorant and it keeps me fresh for the whole day.  </li>
            <li>The Chamomile has a pleasing, fresh, light scent.</li>
            <li>This was recommended to me, as pretty safe for sensitive skin, as most cancer patients are referred to this deodorant.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>But I love this particular brand.</li>
            <li>good fragance and keeps me all day dry</li>
            <li>If you apply liberally and let it dry well after washing your underarms,  you&#x27;re good to go all day in my experience.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have aluminum chlorohydrate, paraben free and hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a more natural alternative to BO</li>
            <li>In my quest to find a natural deodorant, I&#x27;ve used many.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>This was my standard before I started making my own.</li>
            <li>I have been using it now for over a year, and love that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>Works well and its worth the money to buy this and try it.</li>
            <li>one is my favorite by far.  </li>
            <li>The scent is more masculine.</li>
            <li>though the other choices may be just as good to try.</li>
            <li>the price was right, too.  </li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t like unscented deodorants, either, so this was just right for me.  </li>
            <li>In general I love this product, but it does have a.couple downfalls.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, clear and most important safer than the other deodorants.</li>
            <li>Of course, it is not an antiperspirant, just a deodorant, but it still reduces perspiration pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I was able to find this at my local Alfalffa&#x27;s health food store.</li>
            <li>it works the same as most others-</li>
            <li>Get the other &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; they are much better smelling!</li>
            <li>Toms actually made me smell MORE.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a product that works without all the harmful chemicals found in most commercial antiperspirants.  </li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s really hot out here.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper to buy on Amazon!</li>
            <li>The scent is a little strong, but ok.  </li>
            <li>This Crystal Mineral Deodorant works just as well as any other deodorant and it smells really nice...</li>
            <li>, I have bought it a few times now - the scent is pleasant, and it works better than other non aluminum deodorants like Toms.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for a long time and have no skin irritation,  and its a safe deodorant to use.</li>
            <li>Not bad for a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>As with any natural deodorant, it&#x27;s not an antipersperant, so I do notice that I sweat more now than when I used a combination deoderant/antipersperant; however, it&#x27;s honestly not that much more.</li>
            <li>The shipment was fast .</li>
            <li>This brand does very well.  </li>
            <li>I shop in Whole Foods, Earthfare, and Trader Joe&#x27;s a lot.</li>
            <li>so I thought maybe that was just too much</li>
            <li>A hair dryer helps, it is very watery.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pleasant and subtle.</li>
            <li>Most of the time I am pretty dry, and I live in the high desert of California.</li>
            <li>It does take a little while to dry, and it is way more effective if it dries completely before putting clothes over it.</li>
            <li>Most other natiral deodorants I&#x27;ve used contain coconut oil which just make me feel sticky and don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li>does it smell better than any of he other deodorants I&#x27;ve tried, it feels cleaner and lasts longer.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin issues, I would recommend trying this deodorant first before going on an odyssey on trying a hundred others.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I saw the high marks given in the Crystal Essence review and</li>
            <li>though it says chamomile and green tea, it smells like orange to me, which I like better anyway...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks now, about 3 and have been alternating with the Pomegranate scent which wears off pretty fast, and this is my favorite of the two, it actually smells like perfume to me.</li>
            <li>It is wet when first putting it on and can be deceiving to lead you to think it will stay like that, but it dries within a short time after its on, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about it getting on your clothes, because its light and wont ruin your clothes.</li>
            <li>I live in Los Angeles</li>
            <li>I have tried almost every deodorant available at Walmart or Walgreen&#x27;s and this is the only deodorant I&#x27;ve found that actually works well!  </li>
            <li>Much recommended if you are willing to dry it!</li>
            <li>Provided that I apply it properly and let it dry completely, this deodorant keeps me fresh all day!</li>
            <li>Smells clean but not super girly or floral.</li>
            <li>The pomegranate holds up better and at least still smells like a deodorant even after 8 hours.  </li>
            <li>So... with that said I got on this natural trip...</li>
            <li>The only problem is when I get really sweaty, like at the gym.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and all natural deodorants break me out in a rash</li>
            <li>I carry it in my purse but so far no reapply needed.</li>
            <li>and they are natural and no chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I have always attributed it to there lack of deodorant, or natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>Needs to last much longer.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise I will stick with my Old Spice.  </li>
            <li>I bought these the end of November, so I could use each of them for a reasonable amount of time under different circumstances.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say that this roll-on is very long-lasting and because I can only find it online</li>
            <li>After an entire day, I can still sit next to my hubby and him not make fun of me for being a smelly hippy.  </li>
            <li>I carry one of them around with me and they are small to easy to take them every where.  </li>
            <li>While it states it is a deodorant and not an antiperspirant, I have been dry and odor free all summer long!  </li>
            <li>After reading reviews on tons of different products, I finally decided to try Crystal essense with Chamomile and green tea, because the reviews were mostly positive and because it is insanely cheap in comparison to the others I was considering.     </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice to know that I&#x27;m not spreading heavy metals on my armpits everyday.</li>
            <li>I may need to re-apply in the evening, especially If I&#x27;m going to be hitting the gym after work; however, this deodorant has completely exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li>I have recently decided to turn to natural products just because everything else irritates my skin</li>
            <li>The first and biggest annoyance is that it takes a long time to dry.</li>
            <li>Product does not dry on skin.  </li>
            <li>Let me shed a little background on myself and how I sweat; I&#x27;m a slim woman who works a pretty sedentary office job, showers every night, and I  don&#x27;t sweat a lot.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s hot, I&#x27;ll get a little misty, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m not a long distance runner or anything.</li>
            <li>I have always used clinical strength deodorants in the past, as I am really self conscious about body odor.</li>
            <li>It is somewhat stronger than the other scents and is very \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; smelling if that makes any sense.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lately I&#x27;ve just been really motivated by doing things the natural way, and trying to watch my carbon blueprint.</li>

            <li> This was recommended to me, as pretty safe for sensitive skin, as most cancer patients are referred to this deodorant.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> But I love this particular brand.</li>
            <li> good fragance and keeps me all day dry</li>
            <li> If you apply liberally and let it dry well after washing your underarms,  you&#x27;re good to go all day in my experience.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have aluminum chlorohydrate, paraben free and hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a more natural alternative to BO</li>
            <li> In my quest to find a natural deodorant, I&#x27;ve used many.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> This was my standard before I started making my own.</li>
            <li> I have been using it now for over a year, and love that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> Works well and its worth the money to buy this and try it.</li>
            <li> one is my favorite by far.  </li>
            <li> The scent is more masculine.</li>
            <li> though the other choices may be just as good to try.</li>
            <li> the price was right, too.  </li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t like unscented deodorants, either, so this was just right for me.  </li>
            <li> In general I love this product, but it does have a.couple downfalls.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, clear and most important safer than the other deodorants.</li>
            <li> Of course, it is not an antiperspirant, just a deodorant, but it still reduces perspiration pretty well.  </li>
            <li> I was able to find this at my local Alfalffa&#x27;s health food store.</li>
            <li> it works the same as most others-</li>
            <li> Get the other &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; they are much better smelling!</li>
            <li> Toms actually made me smell MORE.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product that works without all the harmful chemicals found in most commercial antiperspirants.  </li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s really hot out here.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper to buy on Amazon!</li>
            <li> The scent is a little strong, but ok.  </li>
            <li> This Crystal Mineral Deodorant works just as well as any other deodorant and it smells really nice...</li>
            <li> , I have bought it a few times now - the scent is pleasant, and it works better than other non aluminum deodorants like Toms.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a long time and have no skin irritation,  and its a safe deodorant to use.</li>
            <li> Not bad for a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> As with any natural deodorant, it&#x27;s not an antipersperant, so I do notice that I sweat more now than when I used a combination deoderant/antipersperant; however, it&#x27;s honestly not that much more.</li>
            <li> The shipment was fast .</li>
            <li> This brand does very well.  </li>
            <li> I shop in Whole Foods, Earthfare, and Trader Joe&#x27;s a lot.</li>
            <li> so I thought maybe that was just too much</li>
            <li> A hair dryer helps, it is very watery.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pleasant and subtle.</li>
            <li> Most of the time I am pretty dry, and I live in the high desert of California.</li>
            <li> It does take a little while to dry, and it is way more effective if it dries completely before putting clothes over it.</li>
            <li> Most other natiral deodorants I&#x27;ve used contain coconut oil which just make me feel sticky and don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> does it smell better than any of he other deodorants I&#x27;ve tried, it feels cleaner and lasts longer.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin issues, I would recommend trying this deodorant first before going on an odyssey on trying a hundred others.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I saw the high marks given in the Crystal Essence review and</li>
            <li> though it says chamomile and green tea, it smells like orange to me, which I like better anyway...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks now, about 3 and have been alternating with the Pomegranate scent which wears off pretty fast, and this is my favorite of the two, it actually smells like perfume to me.</li>
            <li> It is wet when first putting it on and can be deceiving to lead you to think it will stay like that, but it dries within a short time after its on, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about it getting on your clothes, because its light and wont ruin your clothes.</li>
            <li> I live in Los Angeles</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every deodorant available at Walmart or Walgreen&#x27;s and this is the only deodorant I&#x27;ve found that actually works well!  </li>
            <li> Much recommended if you are willing to dry it!</li>
            <li> Provided that I apply it properly and let it dry completely, this deodorant keeps me fresh all day!</li>
            <li> Smells clean but not super girly or floral.</li>
            <li> The pomegranate holds up better and at least still smells like a deodorant even after 8 hours.  </li>
            <li> So... with that said I got on this natural trip...</li>
            <li> The only problem is when I get really sweaty, like at the gym.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and all natural deodorants break me out in a rash</li>
            <li> I carry it in my purse but so far no reapply needed.</li>
            <li> and they are natural and no chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I have always attributed it to there lack of deodorant, or natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> Needs to last much longer.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise I will stick with my Old Spice.  </li>
            <li> I bought these the end of November, so I could use each of them for a reasonable amount of time under different circumstances.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say that this roll-on is very long-lasting and because I can only find it online</li>
            <li> After an entire day, I can still sit next to my hubby and him not make fun of me for being a smelly hippy.  </li>
            <li> I carry one of them around with me and they are small to easy to take them every where.  </li>
            <li> While it states it is a deodorant and not an antiperspirant, I have been dry and odor free all summer long!  </li>
            <li> After reading reviews on tons of different products, I finally decided to try Crystal essense with Chamomile and green tea, because the reviews were mostly positive and because it is insanely cheap in comparison to the others I was considering.     </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nice to know that I&#x27;m not spreading heavy metals on my armpits everyday.</li>
            <li> I may need to re-apply in the evening, especially If I&#x27;m going to be hitting the gym after work; however, this deodorant has completely exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> I have recently decided to turn to natural products just because everything else irritates my skin</li>
            <li> The first and biggest annoyance is that it takes a long time to dry.</li>
            <li> Product does not dry on skin.  </li>
            <li> Let me shed a little background on myself and how I sweat; I&#x27;m a slim woman who works a pretty sedentary office job, showers every night, and I  don&#x27;t sweat a lot.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s hot, I&#x27;ll get a little misty, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m not a long distance runner or anything.</li>
            <li> I have always used clinical strength deodorants in the past, as I am really self conscious about body odor.</li>
            <li> It is somewhat stronger than the other scents and is very \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; smelling if that makes any sense.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve just been really motivated by doing things the natural way, and trying to watch my carbon blueprint.</li>
            <li> It dries completely clear and without *any* residue, which means that you can pull on a black sweater hastily without getting the dreaded \\&quot;white lines\\&quot; all over it.     </li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s the issue.&lt;br /&gt;The issue is after work, after not really sweating that much (if at all) I&#x27;ll notice a little funk.</li>
            <li> I was looking for this product for a long time in the stores.</li>
            <li> I received my order even a day earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Works all day long.  </li>
            <li> It takes a long time to dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased it in several other fragrances and they all seem to work well.</li>
            <li> It does keep me dry all day</li>
            <li> If this is your first look into deodorants without aluminum (the disgusting toxin in every single normal deodorant... with links to alzheimers...), let me tell you that I have tried MANY aluminum free deodorants, and they tend to suck REALLY BADLY.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s main positive features are that it doesn&#x27;t have aluminum or anything questionable in it, and it works!</li>
            <li> Gets a little funky if you try to wear it a second day without a shower though</li>
            <li> and I saw some documentary on the cosmetic industry about how it is a waste land for harmful and toxic chemicals and how the FDA does not regulate ingredients being put in cosmetics including deodorant &amp; make up...</li>
            <li> , well, wet until it dries.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a moderate sweater; heavy sweating</li>
            <li> I bought a few different \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorants to compare.  </li>
            <li> Wet wet wet</li>
            <li> Usually with natural deodorants, half way through the day it seems like I did not even put anything on.</li>
            <li> My standby deodorant was Dove Clinical, which was working fine for me, but I hated the high amount of chemicals that I was slathering on my skin every day.</li>
            <li> Never had this problem before with any other deodorant crystals so</li>
            <li> I also prefer the roll-on to the spray since the initial wetness is at least localized.</li>
            <li> It lasts about half a day before needing to reapply.  </li>
            <li> I threw it away after less than a month of use.</li>
            <li> yup, I got a little funk going on.</li>
            <li> shoppers/staff smell a little funky.</li>
            <li> after I used it a few times it miraculously worked.  </li>
            <li> faint odor by three  A natural deodorant that works...</li>
            <li> DEODORANT ROLL ON CHAMOMILE AND GREEN TEA</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> For the past 7 years I was using another &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how the Chamomile scent comes into play looking at the ingredients</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m slowly trying to remove all toxic products from my lifestyle, but when it comes to deodorant I have been reluctant.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s not a good thing because I plan to repurchase.</li>
            <li> The smell makes me nauseated.  </li>
            <li> I quit using unhealthy antiperspirants a year ago.</li>
            <li> The problem with lavender is that after a few hours the scent changes to an unpleasant B.O. smell.  </li>
            <li> Too bad it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I guess it does the job and helps prevent the bad odor at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> but this product is just bad.</li>
            <li> I ended up working it into my cold blow-dry routine and blow drying my underarms!</li>
            <li> I really really hate this deodorant.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works great. Pleasing scent.</li>
            <li> I have always used clinical strength deodorants in the past, as I am really self conscious about body odor. My standby deodorant was Dove Clinical, which was working fine for me, but I hated the high amount of chemicals that I was slathering on my skin every day. After reading reviews on tons of different products, I finally decided to try Crystal essense with Chamomile and green tea, because the reviews were mostly positive and because it is insanely cheap in comparison to the others I was considering.     I have been using it for about 3 weeks now, I am loving it! The smell is fresh and light, so it does not interfere with the scent of perfume or lotions. It dries completely clear and without *any* residue, which means that you can pull on a black sweater hastily without getting the dreaded \\&quot;white lines\\&quot; all over it.     As with any natural deodorant, it&#x27;s not an antipersperant, so I do notice that I sweat more now than when I used a combination deoderant/antipersperant; however, it&#x27;s honestly not that much more. Most of the time I am pretty dry, and I live in the high desert of California. And, even when I do sweat, it&#x27;s totally odorless! It does take a little while to dry, and it is way more effective if it dries completely before putting clothes over it. When I do have to rush and throw clothes on right after putting on the deodorant, it is still pretty effective, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any sort of staining on my clothes from it.    Provided that I apply it properly and let it dry completely, this deodorant keeps me fresh all day! I may need to re-apply in the evening, especially If I&#x27;m going to be hitting the gym after work; however, this deodorant has completely exceeded my expectations! If it continues to work the way it has been, I would totally buy it again.          -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the lavender and pomegranate scents of Crystal and this one is by far the most pleasant!  Of course, it is not an antiperspirant, just a deodorant, but it still reduces perspiration pretty well.  The problem with lavender is that after a few hours the scent changes to an unpleasant B.O. smell.  The pomegranate holds up better and at least still smells like a deodorant even after 8 hours.  The chamomile/green tea keeps the pits smelling good for a whole day!</li>
            <li> I have recently decided to turn to natural products just because everything else irritates my skin and I saw some documentary on the cosmetic industry about how it is a waste land for harmful and toxic chemicals and how the FDA does not regulate ingredients being put in cosmetics including deodorant &amp; make up... So... with that said I got on this natural trip... This Crystal Mineral Deodorant works just as well as any other deodorant and it smells really nice... Umm.. It doesn&#x27;t prevent any sweating I guess if it did it wouldn&#x27;t be \\&quot;natural\\&quot; but it definitely prevents odor so I like it.. I&#x27;ve purchased it in several other fragrances and they all seem to work well.</li>
            <li> I was looking for this product for a long time in the stores. I have used it before and loved it. The only place I found it was Amason.com. I recommend Crystal products to everyone. The shipment was fast . I received my order even a day earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> If this is your first look into deodorants without aluminum (the disgusting toxin in every single normal deodorant... with links to alzheimers...), let me tell you that I have tried MANY aluminum free deodorants, and they tend to suck REALLY BADLY.  This brand does very well.  I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stops odor all day, without giving you cancer.  :P  Can&#x27;t beat that.  Gets a little funky if you try to wear it a second day without a shower though, so I don&#x27;t recommend it.  Others will suffer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it says chamomile and green tea, it smells like orange to me, which I like better anyway...</li>
            <li> Product does not dry on skin.  Wet wet wet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a more natural alternative to BO and I think I finally hit on my solution.  I love the light smell of this deodorant and it keeps me fresh for the whole day.  The only problem is when I get really sweaty, like at the gym.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to hold up to that kind of activity.  But for normal activity, this one is great.  It&#x27;s also nice to know that I&#x27;m not spreading heavy metals on my armpits everyday.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and all natural deodorants break me out in a rash and/or don&#x27;t seem to work well with odor and perspiration. This was recommended to me, as pretty safe for sensitive skin, as most cancer patients are referred to this deodorant. I have been using it for several days and it seems to work well, no rashes, no staining of my clothing, and most important safe for my body to use. Everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different, and body odor can be a very individual issue on what works and what doesn&#x27;t. If you have sensitive skin issues, I would recommend trying this deodorant first before going on an odyssey on trying a hundred others. I was able to find this at my local Alfalffa&#x27;s health food store. It comes fragrance free or you can find it in Chamomile or Lavender scents.  The Chamomile has a pleasing, fresh, light scent.</li>
            <li> Excellent deodorant for those not wanting to use deodorants with aluminum in them.Has an excellent smell to it &amp; works great at controlling odor throughout the day.Important to follow the instructions on the bottle to get the best benefits.Only drawback is you have to wait for it to dry,can not be in a rush when getting dress or it will rub off on your clothes.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every deodorant available at Walmart or Walgreen&#x27;s and this is the only deodorant I&#x27;ve found that actually works well!  I love it.  I&#x27;ve ordered this one and the unscented and both work great.</li>
            <li> I liked this for a year or two, for a &#x27;happy deodorant&#x27; it works the same as most others- kinda ok.  But then I discovered it&#x27;s way better to make my own by mixing together coconut &amp; shea butter, baking soda and tea tree oil and voila, best deodorant out there.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my almost teenage daughter.  It&#x27;s easy to use, clear and most important safer than the other deodorants.</li>
            <li> Iam 5&#x27;10 250lbs and this deodorant does just fine. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and my body has adjusted fine. I apply in morning after my shower,  that&#x27;s it. I carry it in my purse but so far no reapply needed. I&#x27;m hoping it holds out all summer.</li>
            <li> I love the crystal deodorant cause they smell nice and they are natural and no chemicals.  I carry one of them around with me and they are small to easy to take them every where.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really really hate this deodorant.  The smell makes me nauseated.  Get the other &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; they are much better smelling!</li>
            <li> I was attracted to this deodorant due to the awesome scentâ€”it&#x27;s pleasant and subtle. Too bad it doesn&#x27;t work. Let me shed a little background on myself and how I sweat; I&#x27;m a slim woman who works a pretty sedentary office job, showers every night, and I  don&#x27;t sweat a lot. If it&#x27;s hot, I&#x27;ll get a little misty, but that&#x27;s about it. When I work out, I sweat, but that&#x27;s all good. I understand this isn&#x27;t an antiperspirant so that&#x27;s the issue.&lt;br /&gt;The issue is after work, after not really sweating that much (if at all) I&#x27;ll notice a little funk. I&#x27;m sitting here typing this in my air conditioned living room andâ€”wait, let me checkâ€”yup, I got a little funk going on. Never had this problem before with any other deodorant crystals so, yea, I won&#x27;t be buying this again and won&#x27;t be recommending this to my friends.</li>
            <li> Not bad for a natural deodorant. I guess it does the job and helps prevent the bad odor at the end of the day. Could have had more fragrance IMO.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m slowly trying to remove all toxic products from my lifestyle, but when it comes to deodorant I have been reluctant. I shop in Whole Foods, Earthfare, and Trader Joe&#x27;s a lot. Quite a bit of there shoppers/staff smell a little funky. I have always attributed it to there lack of deodorant, or natural deodorant. I don&#x27;t like smelling B O, nor do I want to smell myself, but I took a chance with this one and it&#x27;s great. It has a nice, light aroma, plus It doesn&#x27;t leave a film in my pits or clothing. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Needs to last much longer.  Please have a liter of this available(as a refill).  So maybe there should be a way to refill this liquid.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this product on Amazon.com rather at a local Health/Herbal store. I really like the smell and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have aluminum chlorohydrate, paraben free and hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant - I ususally don&#x27;&#x27;t like liquid deodorants because it leaves your underarm, well, wet until it dries. But I like this one, I have bought it a few times now - the scent is pleasant, and it works better than other non aluminum deodorants like Toms. Toms actually made me smell MORE. This seems to keep everything at bay, I love it. I will eep buying!</li>
            <li> good fragance and keeps me all day dry</li>
            <li> I quit using unhealthy antiperspirants a year ago. In my quest to find a natural deodorant, I&#x27;ve used many. This is by far my favorite. It&#x27;s cheaper than the others, lasts OVER 24 hours (even in this Texas summer heat!) and dries clean like you have nothing on. Most other natiral deodorants I&#x27;ve used contain coconut oil which just make me feel sticky and don&#x27;t work as well. Anyways, I&#x27;ll keep buying this!!</li>
            <li> This smells even better than the lavender/white tea version!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product that works without all the harmful chemicals found in most commercial antiperspirants.  My daughter recommended this product.  I have used it all summer and I must admit, I like it.  While it states it is a deodorant and not an antiperspirant, I have been dry and odor free all summer long!  I plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it does not have triclosan (a carcinogenic used it many deodorants and sanitizing soaps today) and it is not an antiperspirant (sweating is good for you). Does the job and has a pleasant odor. Have to re-apply if I have been outside during the summer in our hot/humid climate - not a problem - otherwise keeps me odor-free all day.</li>
            <li> This was my standard before I started making my own. This scent most effective.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant. The smell is just perfect - light and not overpowering. I haven&#x27;t tested in the summer yet but I am very impressed so far. Usually with natural deodorants, half way through the day it seems like I did not even put anything on. After an entire day, I can still sit next to my hubby and him not make fun of me for being a smelly hippy.  I also prefer the roll-on to the spray since the initial wetness is at least localized.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I&#x27;ve used it for a long time and have no skin irritation,  and its a safe deodorant to use.</li>
            <li> This contains aluminum. Potassium alum is a form of aluminum. This actually worked for me even though I didn&#x27;t care for the scent. I returned it as soon as I realized this company is somewhat deceiving consumers. I am trying to avoid all forms of aluminum.</li>
            <li> Great product, nice to have some &amp;#34;scents&amp;#34; for a mineral salt deodorant.  Great for sensitive skin!  Works all day long.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> after I used it a few times it miraculously worked.  Not my favorite deodorant but at this point I guess it&#x27;s my 2nd fav.  Anything is better than Tom&#x27;s of Maine which does nothing for me &amp; I&#x27;m not a long distance runner or anything.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I have been using it now for over a year, and love that it&#x27;s all natural. I have been recommending this to others, and will continue recommending it.</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve just been really motivated by doing things the natural way, and trying to watch my carbon blueprint. I had a talk with a friend and he mentioned that when he was recovering from cancer and to this day he uses salt deodorant. I live in Los Angeles so I thought maybe that was just too much you know? Because it&#x27;s really hot out here. I decided to try this anyway, not only does it smell better than any of he other deodorants I&#x27;ve tried, it feels cleaner and lasts longer. I am sooo impressed with this product. I got two and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> Good thought using all natural ingredients.  Day One...smelled an odor by midday Day Two...smelled an odor by 10 am Day Three.....faint odor by three  A natural deodorant that works...I will have to go looking for. Otherwise I will stick with my Old Spice.  Update: Natural Ingredients good but this product is just bad. Throwing it out.</li>
            <li> No aluminum in it that can cause health problems over time. Works well and its worth the money to buy this and try it. the smell is light  and not overpowering. and I didn&#x27;t want one that had a strong smell. though the other choices may be just as good to try. It does keep me dry all day and i don&#x27;t have to reapply and  I don&#x27;t have alot of body odor or sweat under my arms. It is wet when first putting it on and can be deceiving to lead you to think it will stay like that, but it dries within a short time after its on, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about it getting on your clothes, because its light and wont ruin your clothes. I recommend this to women friends and family.</li>
            <li> This was shipped very quickly! In general I love this product, but it does have a.couple downfalls. The first and biggest annoyance is that it takes a long time to dry. I ended up working it into my cold blow-dry routine and blow drying my underarms! Also, the.chamomile scent is nice, depending on what you like. It is somewhat stronger than the other scents and is very \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; smelling if that makes any sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s main positive features are that it doesn&#x27;t have aluminum or anything questionable in it, and it works! If you apply liberally and let it dry well after washing your underarms,  you&#x27;re good to go all day in my experience. I&#x27;m a moderate sweater; heavy sweating I&#x27;m not sure about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah! Much recommended if you are willing to dry it!</li>
            <li> I bought a few different \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorants to compare.  I have been using the solid mineral rock.  But, my husband doesn&#x27;t like those; said they do not work for him.  So, I went out on a mission to find one he would like and that I might use as well.  I bought these the end of November, so I could use each of them for a reasonable amount of time under different circumstances.  I am reviewing these appropriately on how they help eliminate the stink.  However, this is my husband&#x27;s fav for scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my personal results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MINERAL DEODORANT ROLL ON CHAMOMILE AND GREEN TEA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is my favorite by far.  It dries quickly.  It has a mild nice scent.  We are odor free all do and do not need to reapply.  To me, the solid crystal rock is still the best, but this is a very close second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TOM&#x27;S OF MAINE, Citrus Zest Crystal Confidence Deodorant - 2.4 oz&lt;br /&gt;This one is ok.  The scent is a little strong, but ok.  Did not keep either of us odor free all day.  Had to reapply 3 times during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CRYSTAL - CRYSTAL BODY SPRAY, 4 FL OZ SPRAY&lt;br /&gt;Surprised at how ineffective this one was because of the minerals. It takes a long time to dry.  A hair dryer helps, it is very watery.  It lasts about half a day before needing to reapply.  It may be because it is in a spray form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BURT&#x27;S BEES HERBAL DEODORANT&lt;br /&gt;It did not help with odor all day.  It acts more like a perfume.  The scent is more masculine. It is a deodorant and not an antiperspirant, as are these others.  However, this is my husband&#x27;s fav for scent.</li>
            <li> For the past 7 years I was using another &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant. (I am a breast cancer survivor).  I won&#x27;t mention the brand but it was just &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;, working better in the colder months.  In the heat it didn&#x27;t perform well at all! I went online to try to find something better.  I read all kinds of reviews but most of the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; rated products were costly, like $18.00 per bottle!  I saw the high marks given in the Crystal Essence review and the price was right, too.  I found the product to keep me odor free, even on the hottest days.  The scent is mild and pleasant, not overpowering.  But I don&#x27;t like unscented deodorants, either, so this was just right for me.  I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipment!!! Works great combine when combine with baby powder!!!! I would defininely recommend.to friends and family to use !!Love the smelll!!!</li>
            <li> Smells great and works well.  Much cheaper to buy on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love Crystal stick, but this the first with a scent. But I love this particular brand. it works for me.</li>
            <li> Love this deodorant. Smells clean but not super girly or floral. My favorite out of all the scents!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this smell. I&#x27;m not sure how the Chamomile scent comes into play looking at the ingredients but I love this scent. I wouldn&#x27;t say that this roll-on is very long-lasting and because I can only find it online that&#x27;s not a good thing because I plan to repurchase. I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks now, about 3 and have been alternating with the Pomegranate scent which wears off pretty fast, and this is my favorite of the two, it actually smells like perfume to me. I have no irritation and would definiteley repurchase. I do have to apply a second time throughout the day sometimes so that&#x27;s my only hang-up but I do like this a lot.</li>
            <li> Gross....gross....just gross. It doesn&#x27;t keep the smell away and then when u put it on the smell transfers over to the deodorant and it never leaves. I threw it away after less than a month of use. Ew!</li>
