    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is a joy to wear and have!</li>
            <li>Any form of Habanita by Molinard is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Incredible lasing power.  </li>
            <li>Oh it smelled SOOOOOOOOOOOOO Good!</li>
            <li>My wife still likes it and so do I, but it simply isn&#x27;t great anymore.</li>
            <li>Great sillage.  </li>
            <li>Very nice indeed.</li>
            <li>The item arrived in good condition and was as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I Love it now and Habanita might even become my Signature Frang!</li>
            <li>It was one of the most incredible and sophisticated fragrances I have ever smelled and I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>Rose, Smokey, musky, tones</li>
            <li>My favorite perfume ever.</li>
            <li>I love the Habanita.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing like the inimitable perfume, but for this price, I love it.</li>
            <li>I am pleased.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Now I absolutely Love it.</li>
            <li>The bottle is absolutely lovely- designed by lalique.</li>
            <li>This is the softest, most powdery scent I ever tried.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Interesting fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Fine classic at a very good price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very unique.  </li>
            <li>Habanita by Molinard is a fragrance created in the 1920&#x27;s to perfume cigars and cigarettes, eventually becoming a perfume for women.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the original Habanita</li>
            <li>Could be used easily by both women and men.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This is fabulous as a room spray, less delicious on skin.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s way too strong and sweet smelling for me</li>
            <li>I think it would be too sophisticated for a young woman or an ing&amp;eacute;nue, but for the adult or mature woman it is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>This is a Great scent ONLY if you are interested in a Vintage 50&#x27;s mood.</li>
            <li>Soft, spicy and warm, but not for wimps.</li>
            <li>First, Habanita is a strong fragrance.</li>
            <li>Not at all sweet, just sandalwood-Oriental and seems to be aldehydes (fresh air smell.)  </li>
            <li>; I&#x27;m going to look around for a new favorite.</li>
            <li>Well worth checking this one out.</li>
            <li>The top notes are, mastic, petit grain and geranium; middle notes are</li>
            <li>I became aware of this fact,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>I find the black bottle lovely, and the perfume interesting in an old fashioned way. .</li>
            <li>It seems like every time I put some on, it smells different than the last, but each time it seems to have more Depth to it!</li>
            <li>It also smells a little musky, in a nice way.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.  </li>
            <li>Breaking it down, initially I smell leather, then more leather, pleasant but unidentifiable florals, vetiver and nutmeg which dries down to  a lovely slightly powdery apricot.</li>
            <li>If you have read my previous perfume reviews you know I LOVE non-floral, heady scents...</li>
            <li>it smells like new car leather with a whiff of cigar.</li>
            <li>but it was reformulated awhile back into a sicky sweet smell too low on the leathery, musky end and way too high on the feathery &amp;#34;White Shoulders&amp;#34; type aromas.  </li>
            <li>The composition supposedly contains the same 600 ingredients as the original though they are differently placed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sadly I could not afford an entire bottle of the stuff and wore the EDT for a while, which while long lasting, smelled like a more powdery version of Shalimar on me.</li>
            <li>Smell of the old perfumes from 50s</li>
            <li>Old Musky Scent .</li>
            <li>Not for the young at heart.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a scent that people near you notice, this will do.</li>
            <li>A few years ago I ordered a decant of the original Habanita, an Oriental perfume  with top notes of orange blossom, raspberry, peach and bergamot; middle notes of lilac, orris root, jasmine, heliotrope, ylang-ylang and rose; base notes of leather, amber, musk, benzoin, vanilla, oakmoss and cedar.</li>
            <li>Absolutely a thumbs down for me</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on and off for years...and I keep coming back to it. Soft, spicy and warm, but not for wimps.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume ever. Nothing but complements when I wear it. It used to be hard to find. I had to send to Grasse, France to get it. Thank goodness it&#x27;s now on Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Please change the e-mail customer name to MADELINE.  Thanks.  I love the Habanita.  It&#x27;s very unique.  Not at all sweet, just sandalwood-Oriental and seems to be aldehydes (fresh air smell.)  Could be used easily by both women and men.  Very nice indeed.</li>
            <li> The only two perfumes I wear are Bal A Versailles and Habanita.  This is a joy to wear and have!</li>
            <li> A few years ago I ordered a decant of the original Habanita, an Oriental perfume  with top notes of orange blossom, raspberry, peach and bergamot; middle notes of lilac, orris root, jasmine, heliotrope, ylang-ylang and rose; base notes of leather, amber, musk, benzoin, vanilla, oakmoss and cedar. It was one of the most incredible and sophisticated fragrances I have ever smelled and I fell in love with it. Incidentally, one of my cats was so enchanted when she got a whiff of my wrist that she went into an ecstatic frenzy , rolling on the floor and yelping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly I could not afford an entire bottle of the stuff and wore the EDT for a while, which while long lasting, smelled like a more powdery version of Shalimar on me. Recently I read that Molinard had reformulated the EDP and thought I would give it a try. Well, it&#x27;s not Shalimar, thank goodness. The composition supposedly contains the same 600 ingredients as the original though they are differently placed. The top notes are, mastic, petit grain and geranium; middle notes are ylang-ylang, heliotrope, vetiver, jasmine, mimosa, rose, nutmeg and  cedar, and the base notes are musk, amber, patchouli, sandalwood, oak moss and vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On me it smells like new car leather with a whiff of cigar. Breaking it down, initially I smell leather, then more leather, pleasant but unidentifiable florals, vetiver and nutmeg which dries down to  a lovely slightly powdery apricot. It&#x27;s nothing like the inimitable perfume, but for this price, I love it. And it is very long lasting, I put it on at 8.pm. and could still smell it in the morning.</li>
            <li> Smell of the old perfumes from 50s</li>
            <li> The item arrived in good condition and was as advertised.  I am pleased.</li>
            <li> Old Musky Scent . This is a Great scent ONLY if you are interested in a Vintage 50&#x27;s mood. Not for the young at heart. Rose, Smokey, musky, tones</li>
            <li> If you have read my previous perfume reviews you know I LOVE non-floral, heady scents...this perfume kept showing up in fragrances with some of the basenotes I like in perfumes...woody, vanilla, spicy....got rave reviews on a fragrance site and all I can say is it smells like &amp;#34;Old Spice or that really awful Pierre Cardin cologne guys wore back in the day that was super strong&amp;#34;. Absolutely a thumbs down for me and I so wanted to like it...I even bought the shower gel...going in my fragrance to give away drawer!</li>
            <li> the combination of ingredients has been modified and the perfume is not what it used to be. My wife still likes it and so do I, but it simply isn&#x27;t great anymore.</li>
            <li> First, Habanita is a strong fragrance. If you are looking for a scent that people near you notice, this will do. In layman&#x27;s terms, this scent is powdery. It reminds me of Shalimar....not bad, but a bit grandmotherly.</li>
            <li> Habanita by Molinard is a fragrance created in the 1920&#x27;s to perfume cigars and cigarettes, eventually becoming a perfume for women. I became aware of this fact,&lt;br /&gt;and out of curiosity bought a bottle, whose art deco attracted me. I find the black bottle lovely, and the perfume interesting in an old fashioned way. .</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this fragrance.  It is feminine without being floral or fruity.  I smell a faint trace of tobacco, even though it is not part of its contents. It also smells a little musky, in a nice way.  I think it would be too sophisticated for a young woman or an ing&amp;eacute;nue, but for the adult or mature woman it is wonderful.  I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the original Habanita but it was reformulated awhile back into a sicky sweet smell too low on the leathery, musky end and way too high on the feathery &amp;#34;White Shoulders&amp;#34; type aromas.  Every time I used it I could taste it in my mouth and feel for me the scent has been ruined.  A lot of people seem to like it but it&#x27;s way too strong and sweet smelling for me-I miss the subtlety of its past.  You may still like it but be forewarned; I&#x27;m going to look around for a new favorite.</li>
            <li> Now I absolutely Love it. It seems like every time I put some on, it smells different than the last, but each time it seems to have more Depth to it! I Love it now and Habanita might even become my Signature Frang! The other day I turned my Head and it felt like a &amp;#34;Note&amp;#34; jumped on my shoulder! Oh it smelled SOOOOOOOOOOOOO Good!</li>
            <li> This is fabulous as a room spray, less delicious on skin. It smells dated. The bottle is absolutely lovely- designed by lalique.</li>
            <li> Any form of Habanita by Molinard is wonderful.  It has become my signature fragrace and I constantly receive compliments on it.</li>
            <li> This is the softest, most powdery scent I ever tried. I love it.</li>
            <li> Great sillage.  Incredible lasing power.  Interesting fragrance.  Fine classic at a very good price.  Well worth checking this one out.</li>
