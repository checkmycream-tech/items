            <li>Right before this weekend!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit stronger, well not as sweet smelling as the body butter</li>
            <li>They might have changed for the better since then (as far as the smell) but these mist sprays no matter what scent, after you spray it on within minutes you cannot tell you have put anything on...</li>
            <li>maybe the Perfume bottles are stronger but to me no matter how pretty the packaging or nice the smell if it doesn&#x27;t last then</li>

            <li>i just wanted it to have a more subtle scent</li>

            <li> Smells almost an expensive perfume...it&#x27;s really nice!</li>
            <li> Same product you get in bath and body works without going to bath and body works. Shipped in half the estimated time.</li>
            <li> Best new scent in a long time. I am a bath and body works junkie. Love this scent</li>
            <li> AH!!!SMELLLS SOOOOO GOOOOOOD &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I recommend it</li>
            <li> overpowering scent, more like a perfume than a body spray...not what i expected.  it doesn&#x27;t smell bad..i just wanted it to have a more subtle scent</li>
            <li> Omg this scent is my favorite now! My husband likes the smell too according to him it smells like signature perfume. Definitely will buy again</li>
            <li> Loved the smell my sister got it for a gift smells amazing!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PERFUME,i used to buy it from the mall $14 but in here its cheaper, all my friends kno how i smell,i can&#x27;t go anywhere without putting this perfume on!!üòçüòçüòÑ</li>
            <li> Smells delightful and worth every penny!!!!! Complements for days!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SCENT! It&#x27;s a bit stronger, well not as sweet smelling as the body butter but it is the same scent! And the amazon seller Cents For My Scents is amazing, I ordered this on the 15th and it wasn&#x27;t scheduled for delivery until the 22nd or 28th at the latest....I received it with excellent packaging within 3 days. Right before this weekend! Will DEFINITELY be buying more items form Cents For My Scents!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> Very Good And It Showed Up Faster Than I Expected, I Will Buy Again From This Seller, When It&#x27;s Time But Next Time I Hope To Buy 2 Instead Of One!!!!;) Thanks</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful. I had wanted the hair spray with glitter.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of a lot of different Bath and Body works products HOWEVER...Is it just me or do these sprays not last? I never use the lotions because they contain parabens but even when I used to years ago they never smelled the same after you rubbed the lotion on...they just had a stale lotion smell. They might have changed for the better since then (as far as the smell) but these mist sprays no matter what scent, after you spray it on within minutes you cannot tell you have put anything on...maybe the Perfume bottles are stronger but to me no matter how pretty the packaging or nice the smell if it doesn&#x27;t last then it&#x27;s a waste of money. I used to buy mostly Victoria&#x27;s Secret sprays and lotions because they lasted and were different but over the years I have notices that they are not as good anymore either.</li>
            <li> This body spray is seriously a must have, love it!!</li>
            <li> Ok honestly it&#x27;s very good, it&#x27;s cheaper than in the store !! Just amazing i love it and it was sent to me earlier than expected i guess it depends on where you live‚ò∫Ô∏è</li>
            <li> Love this spray! Combine with lotion for all day/night elegant scent!  Never get tired of it!</li>
            <li> smells better than expected.</li>
            <li> Smelt good and got it in the mail way before the date! Very nice.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing hope it stays around quite a while :)</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! Also, cheaper than in store. Love!</li>
            <li> Absolutely adore this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Smells really good! Not strong smelling.</li>
