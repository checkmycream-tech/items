            <li>Has a nice, lively scent.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s good enough for what I purchased it for.</li>
            <li>My hubby has notice my face feeling softer and more alive since I&#x27;ve been using this.  </li>
            <li>nice scent - using for blends, fairly strong, so little is needed</li>
            <li>This fragrance is so relaxing and peaceful.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with Neroli and this Sun Essential oil</li>

            <li>On bottle says it&#x27;s good for aromatherapy, and I&#x27;m adding a few drops to my Aroma Globe.</li>
            <li>If it is pure it should not be diluted.  </li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to fragrant orange blossom</li>
            <li>but they do not say how much.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to enjoy it for a long time to come.</li>
            <li>I love that it is a large long lasting size bottle.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s different and exciting all in one little bottle must try and fall in love like myself.</li>
            <li>, that makes it very simple to get the right amount each time.</li>
            <li>great price for the product, was unsure if I would like it since it was so much less than other places, but after using it I believe it to be of equal quality.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s interesting and people can&#x27;t usually decipher what it is.  </li>

            <li> Sun Organic Neroli Essential Oil comes in a dark glass bottle to protect the oil from sunlight and it has a plastic dropper included</li>
            <li> I also make my face lotion with Neroli and a few drop of Lavender (also from Sun Essential Oils)</li>

            <li> It smells like tea tree oil and not orange blossom at all. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad. I was really looking forward to fragrant orange blossom smells. On bottle says it&#x27;s good for aromatherapy, and I&#x27;m adding a few drops to my Aroma Globe.</li>
            <li> This is totally mis-represented.  It is a diluted oil but they do not say how much.  If it is pure it should not be diluted.  If it is diluted it should say so.</li>
            <li> Good purchase.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> great price for the product, was unsure if I would like it since it was so much less than other places, but after using it I believe it to be of equal quality.</li>

            <li> This scent is without a doubt the BEST!! I&#x27;m in love with Neroli and this Sun Essential oil is awesome.  Because Neroli is great for aging skin, I made up lotion bars, in fun shapes, like rose, flower, star etc.  These I use for my body after my showers.  Skin is so yummy soft.  I also make my face lotion with Neroli and a few drop of Lavender (also from Sun Essential Oils) (I&#x27;m hooked on their quality)  My hubby has notice my face feeling softer and more alive since I&#x27;ve been using this.  At night I use a few drops in my diffuser in the bedroom, results:  sweet dreams!  I was given this at a great discount to give my honest opinion.  I highly recommend this oil, and the company Sun Essential.</li>
            <li> Always been a fan of citrus-y scents.  Neroli is one of my favourites and I always receive nice compliments-- it&#x27;s interesting and people can&#x27;t usually decipher what it is.  I just dab a little here and there and I&#x27;m good too go.  GREAT for warmer months.. reminds me of orange blossom</li>
            <li> Never heard of this one but it&#x27;s different and exciting all in one little bottle must try and fall in love like myself. I received this to review at no cost to give my honest opinion.</li>

            <li> Neroli oil has many health benefits..it can be used as an antidepressant, aphrodisiac, antiseptic, bactericidal, cordial, carminative, cicatrisant, cytophylactic, disinfectant, antispasmodic, deodorant, digestive, emollient, sedative and tonic substance. the smell isnt too bad so i put it in my diffuser and it worked amazingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*i received this product at a reduced or free price in exchanged for a completely unbiased review. the opinions expressed are my own.</li>
            <li> I received this to review and love it. It smells great and i find new uses for it everyday. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This oil has a pleasant scent, like ylang ylang &amp; jasmine. However, I will not be using it because the other oils sent to me to test by this company made me feel sick to my stomach &amp; caused my arm to go numb. I have not had this experience with any other oil &amp; I have used many. Do not buy anything from this brand. Make sure the oils you use have been tested for purity &amp; be sure that contact information is available in case something goes wrong.

            <li> The smell is full bodied, earthy and complex with a lingering, floral dry down. It reminds me of some of the Aveda pure-fume sprays. Some of the reviews i read said that neroli smells citrusy but I don&#x27;t get that. Hope this helps someone.</li>
            <li> nice scent - using for blends, fairly strong, so little is needed</li>
            <li> This is definitely pure essential oil, even came with a plastic dropper. So glad I bought this, it smells amazing! Great price and fast delivery!</li>
