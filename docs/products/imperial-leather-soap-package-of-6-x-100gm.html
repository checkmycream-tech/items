            <li>nice feel on skin love it</li>
            <li>Glad to find a way to order it in the USA.</li>
            <li>I have used Imperial Leather soap for many, many, years replenishing my supply by purchases from around the world from Singapore to Vancouver.</li>
            <li>LOVE THE SENT</li>
            <li>My husband and son both are pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>&quot; might be more appropriate.</li>
            <li>Found it on a trip to Scotland many years ago and have been using it ever since.</li>
            <li>I love this soap.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Imperial Leather for more decades</li>
            <li>This is a very unique scented soap.&lt;br /&gt;considering</li>
            <li>Still a pretty good soap though.</li>
            <li>Love this soap and we are glad it is still available.</li>
            <li>feels clean too!</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend; great leathery scent, lathers well, &amp; washes off easily.</li>
            <li>Easy on your skin and smells fresh. :-)</li>
            <li>Terrible...had I know this is a cheap .99 cent store type soap</li>
            <li>Anything I use on my body is not going to be cheap stuff.</li>
            <li>love this soap, miss this soap, wish it were more readily (and cheaply) available in the US.</li>
            <li>Several years ago the soap had an unusual delightful scent ( as when it was designed for the Empress of Russia so the story goes), Then the ingredients were changed  and the scent was lost.</li>
            <li>Did not expected to be this good</li>
            <li>Exceptionally clean, non-drying feel after using.  </li>
            <li>So many changes in life, so many dear and near ones departed us to Heavenly abode years again went on relentlessly....</li>
            <li>Have loved this creamy soap and the scent reminiscent of leather ever since a friend in England sent me a bar.</li>
            <li>Gentle with a lovely scent</li>
            <li>I have loved this soap for years, it is good to know I can finally get if back.</li>
            <li>excellent soap, with few air pockets, lasts twice as long as drug store soaps, good lather, pleasing aroma, high quality product</li>
            <li>does lather up really well, is easy on the skin and leaves a muted&lt;br /&gt;clean leather type smell on one&#x27;s skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love English Leather, and this is a worthy competitor!  </li>
            <li>Takes awhile to get here but is worth it.</li>
            <li>the scent on it gives the right amount of spice.</li>
            <li>This is the same original great stuff I discovered for super cheap in Scotland a few years ago.</li>
            <li>I was happy to find that Amazon carried it and I will not have to worry about  running short in future.</li>
            <li>I use it all the time, glad I can order it online without having to wait to my next trip to the UK for refills!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great fragrance, long lasting.  </li>
            <li>The soap is very creamy with a fresh scent for either a man or woman.</li>
            <li>the fresh, not-overcomplicated, somewhat masculine scent of it...</li>
            <li>finished my MS thanks to University of London...</li>
            <li>Simple, only lightly scented (I&#x27;d buy unscented if I could), and rich in lather.</li>
            <li>It smells similar to the original British-made product</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more soon to send to a missionary family I support for exactly the same reasons I stated above.</li>
            <li>It is clean, manly, and simple.  </li>
            <li>Got exposed to this soap during a trip to the UK and loved it simplicity, the smell, and the cool logo embedded/a fixed to the bar (the latter gives it a little something extra) - a real classic.</li>
            <li>After reading several comments and reading as much as was legible in the photos of Cussons Imperial Leather Talc on the Amazon web site, I thought I had chosen the right product - that produced by Cussons in England.</li>
            <li>Finally, I can get my favorite British soap here in the US.  </li>
            <li>classic fragrance, classic soap.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an Old Spice liq soap user, but I must say this soap is really nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Terrence E. Maltbia, New York, USA</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s becoming a little cumbersome</li>
            <li>It is still exactly as I remembered it, the same look, smell and feel.  </li>
            <li>this is an old product we used to buy.  </li>
            <li>Does the job but has never caused any allergic reactions to sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This a old world/old school soap.  </li>
            <li>I became old....</li>
            <li>Seriously its the same kind of soap you find at the .99 cent store.  </li>
            <li>It has a classic English Leather type of scent.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Soon I finished my High School days to University, new friends, new environments, girls and other distractions followed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is that I paid nearly $100</li>
            <li>Gets you clean, doesn&#x27;t scum up, lasts forever.</li>

            <li> It smells of new leather, spice, and green meadows due to</li>
            <li> The soap has a similar fragrance, and the bars are solid and hard and last a long time.  </li>
            <li> It did arrive quicker than expected</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not irritate my skin like I find a lot of other soaps can.</li>

            <li> Several years ago the soap had an unusual delightful scent ( as when it was designed for the Empress of Russia so the story goes), Then the ingredients were changed  and the scent was lost. Still a pretty good soap though.</li>
            <li> This is the same original great stuff I discovered for super cheap in Scotland a few years ago. Definitely recommend; great leathery scent, lathers well, &amp; washes off easily.</li>
            <li> Terrible...had I know this is a cheap .99 cent store type soap I would of never order it.  Seriously its the same kind of soap you find at the .99 cent store.  bad quality cheaply perfumed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap as long as I can remember.&lt;br /&gt;It smells delicious and people have always commented on how soft my skin is and I don&#x27;t regularly moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;It does not irritate my skin like I find a lot of other soaps can.</li>
            <li> Did not expected to be this good it&#x27;s very good</li>
            <li> Have loved this creamy soap and the scent reminiscent of leather ever since a friend in England sent me a bar. Glad to find a way to order it in the USA.</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever!</li>
            <li> bumped into this soap by accident at a recent london trip,&lt;br /&gt;loved the fresh, not-overcomplicated, somewhat masculine scent of it...</li>
            <li> This is the version from Thailand. It smells cheaper and more artificial than the UK version.</li>
            <li> My manliness has increased like.. 15 times.. The only problem is that women are now throwing themselves at me everywhere I go and it&#x27;s becoming a little cumbersome</li>
            <li> Got exposed to this soap during a trip to the UK and loved it simplicity, the smell, and the cool logo embedded/a fixed to the bar (the latter gives it a little something extra) - a real classic. I use it all the time, glad I can order it online without having to wait to my next trip to the UK for refills!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Terrence E. Maltbia, New York, USA</li>
            <li> This is my scent.  It means a lot to me.  It is clean, manly, and simple.  It smells of new leather, spice, and green meadows due to it&#x27;s coumarin content.  I bought several cases of it.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is that I paid nearly $100 and then I looked on the customs declarations page at it&#x27;s stated value, which was under $17 at current exchange rates.  Pee Zed Cussons needs to realize that this Imperial scent has an empire of fans in far-flung lands.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff. Once you buy it you will never go back to the lousy American soaps. This is truly a luxury type item! Anything I use on my body is not going to be cheap stuff. Life is too short!</li>
            <li> excellent soap, with few air pockets, lasts twice as long as drug store soaps, good lather, pleasing aroma, high quality product</li>
            <li> I have used Imperial Leather soap for many, many, years replenishing my supply by purchases from around the world from Singapore to Vancouver. I was happy to find that Amazon carried it and I will not have to worry about  running short in future.</li>
            <li> love this soap, miss this soap, wish it were more readily (and cheaply) available in the US. How can anyone NOT like it!</li>
            <li> Finally, I can get my favorite British soap here in the US.  Gentle with a lovely scent, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE SENT AND IT LASTS A LONG TIME&lt;br /&gt;PEOPLE COMMENT ON IT&lt;br /&gt;WHERE DID YOU GET IT&lt;br /&gt;REMINDS ME OF MY CHILDHOOD</li>
            <li> this is an old product we used to buy.  Were very happy to see it was available through Amazon.  My husband and son both are pleased with this product.  Takes awhile to get here but is worth it.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I use at home for sink and shower.  Simple, only lightly scented (I&#x27;d buy unscented if I could), and rich in lather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since I was a kid  very long lasting  hard  milled  soap  very luxury and quality.</li>
            <li> what can you say. classic fragrance, classic soap. always feel great after using it. nice feel on skin love it</li>
            <li> After reading several comments and reading as much as was legible in the photos of Cussons Imperial Leather Talc on the Amazon web site, I thought I had chosen the right product - that produced by Cussons in England. It did arrive quicker than expected but I felt I had been misled by the description. There was no mention of it being produced in Thailand. It states that it is \\&quot;Original\\&quot; on the container. How can it be if it&#x27;s made outside of England? \\&quot;Similar\\&quot; might be more appropriate. It smells similar to the original British-made product but I&#x27;m not sure yet how well it performs. Will the scent last as long etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Old Spice liq soap user, but I must say this soap is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;It does lather up really well, is easy on the skin and leaves a muted&lt;br /&gt;clean leather type smell on one&#x27;s skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy it again. I wish they made a liq version of it. I&#x27;d change&lt;br /&gt;over in a heart beat !</li>
            <li> Good soap. nice lather. doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume. Last a longer then other bars. Will buy again but probably get the larger pack. .</li>
            <li> I have used this soap for years, from when I lived in the UK. Will always be my soap of choice.</li>
            <li> Gets you clean, doesn&#x27;t scum up, lasts forever. My family has used this soap for decades. Does the job but has never caused any allergic reactions to sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> very pleased with the product thank you</li>
            <li> This is a very unique scented soap.&lt;br /&gt;considering you can&#x27;t find it an USA store there are very few people that will smell like you.&lt;br /&gt;A very great deodorizing soap.</li>
            <li> Love this soap and we are glad it is still available. Found it on a trip to Scotland many years ago and have been using it ever since. Easy on your skin and smells fresh. :-)</li>
            <li> I had not used Imperial Leather soap for years, but decided to try it again as I have some skin allergies and thought this soap would help. It is still exactly as I remembered it, the same look, smell and feel.  I love it, what a great product.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have loved this soap for years, it is good to know I can finally get if back.</li>
            <li> This a old world/old school soap.  I remember my dad and uncles used get this over seas,  two things I remembered about this is the lather and smell.  The lather on this soap beats out anything else out there and the scent on it gives the right amount of spice.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance, long lasting.  It has a classic English Leather type of scent.&lt;br /&gt;This soap will bring back memories for some.</li>
            <li> I started using this soap about 30 years ago when my mothers boyfriend ordered it from an ultra fancy women&#x27;s clothing catalog for her. Then I couldn&#x27;t find it anymore. So happy I ran across it on Amazon I almost forgot it existed. The soap is very creamy with a fresh scent for either a man or woman. It lasts quite a while and the company stamp on the bar lasts until the bar is almost gone. I put several out for guests who usually end up taking them home.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  The fragrance is perfect for men and women. Exceptionally clean, non-drying feel after using.  Lasts a really long time.  Will be ordering more soon to send to a missionary family I support for exactly the same reasons I stated above.</li>
            <li> I like the smell a bunch!</li>
            <li> What a nice find!  I love English Leather, and this is a worthy competitor!  The soap has a similar fragrance, and the bars are solid and hard and last a long time.  I recommend it!</li>
            <li> A great value and seems to have great deodorant effects, too. The scent reminds me of that &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; leather. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I like the soap and so does everyone else in my family..girls and boys. It has a nice fragrance and lathers up a lot. feels clean too!</li>
            <li> Sadly this is a product that the reviews warned about. It is not that Bergamot fragrance that is so distinctive to the Imperial Leather brand.</li>
            <li> Item received within the time allowed.  I have been using Imperial Leather for more decades then I care to remember.  Both my wife and daughter like the fragrance of it.</li>
            <li> Aaah...the fragrance of Cussons.....brought back my memories of my residential school days in India. That was during 1960~1964 there abouts.&lt;br /&gt;My school mates used to steal my Cussons ( Cussons came in smaller variety also) my father went on sending Cussons after Cussons.&lt;br /&gt;We all loved Cussons. Soon I finished my High School days to University, new friends, new environments, girls and other distractions followed.&lt;br /&gt;I soon forgot Cussons.&lt;br /&gt;I finished my MS thanks to University of London... Then employment.... Wedding, children... Worries days passed into months and months into years and years..... So many changes in life, so many dear and near ones departed us to Heavenly abode years again went on relentlessly.... My children had their children... I became old....at 70 suddenly one day, some thing happened to me and the thought of Cussons came into my&lt;br /&gt;mind , my memory. Frantically I searched for it in AMAZON..... There it was there it was my Cussons. Placed order some time ago.... Got it today..... I opened the case...... Took a deep breath of Cussons.... Ahhhhh nostalgia .... Suddenly my old days started unfurling into my old and weak mind.  Cussons..... Thank you thank you for making me happy....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good soap. I like it.</li>
