            <li>Glad I did not spend any more than I did.</li>

            <li>I get so many compliments</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 47 Years old, have enjoyed beautiful skin most of my life.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say you will have fabulous results but it will not cost a fortune to find out and you may love just having more radiant skin!ay</li>
            <li>Clean and exfoliate your face prior to use for best results.  </li>
            <li>This peel is strong.  </li>
            <li>this is not as strong as the medium med peel, so use 2-4 applications</li>
            <li>STRONG  </li>
            <li>I can tell you that it has made a huge difference in the texture of my skin and wrinkles?</li>
            <li>Works great, may go with 30% next time for my face however.</li>
            <li>works...must use a few times for best results...don&#x27;t leave on too long...can burn</li>
            <li>FREE.  </li>
            <li>My goals is get my skin looking great, probably another 4 peels and then back off to a 1-2x per month maintenance.  </li>
            <li>These products are well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a lesser concentration for a year and love this more potent formulation for my face.</li>
            <li>After spending money and experiencing up to a week&#x27;s downtime from peels at the dermatologist&#x27;s office, I was excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal really worked and I wanted  to use something more concentrated, so I bought this  with the \\&quot;Neutralizer\\&quot; from Cellbone.</li>
            <li>Hi, I never write reviews, but I LOVE this product so much I had to share.  </li>
            <li>I love the Cellbone products so much</li>
            <li>I like how gentle but effective this peel is..it does sting and can get intense if you leave it on too</li>
            <li>I never leave the bathroom sink area (in case I need a quick rinse)</li>
            <li>and I always keep a bottle of baking soda and water for a quick neutralizer.</li>
            <li>not over do, if you are using this product more than once a week you are not giving your new skin a chance to develop and grow.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>but the healing time was well worth it since the peel</li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>this product worth the buy if you want the skin to peel off.</li>
            <li>This is good peel to get started but be careful and follow instructions and always purchase the neutralizer.</li>
            <li>but then worth the experience</li>
            <li>after 6 weeks time, I still have more than 1/2 of a bottle left, so as far as value is concerned, it is definitely worth the price of giving it a try since you will be able to give it a good long trial if you wish.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Asked my husband to look and right away he could see and feel the change on my hand.  </li>
            <li>I do wish it had done MORE for improving pigment, but I will continue to use it and hopefully with more time it will lighten the dark spots even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had sensitive skin, so I should have known this product might have been too strong.  </li>
            <li>I use the other 2 products that came along and as using as described I am quite happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li>should have gotten a lesser percentage peel gel something that my face would have been able to handle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I allowed myself to heal after the first use, I did get scald the 1st time I used it, but after the peeling process began I noticed with the underlying skin that my marks was fading</li>
            <li>, today I can say that all my marks have disappeared, my pores are noticeable smaller and my skin tone is smoother, much better than it was.</li>
            <li>I can truly say I am pleased with the overall results of this product.</li>
            <li>Pleased with entire purchase.</li>
            <li>I received this product 3 days ago and I am a first time user.</li>
            <li>but i recommended  seeing a dermatologist first  or someone else to assist with the chemical peeling...  </li>
            <li>Over the next 24 hours, the top layer sheds in strips.  </li>
            <li>When I don&#x27;t use it I can see how much a difference it does make!</li>
            <li>If you tend to burn easily, have an aversion to mild pain or have very dry skin, I don&#x27;t know that I would try this if I were you.</li>
            <li>It is great because you get the effect of a major peel in a few mini-peels.</li>
            <li>if there any complication , go to a dermatologist  to see if he or she an assist the matter because it is very affective if everything goes well , also if the area which you want to be peeled  is large, i 100% recommend someone else assisting you with the peel.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only do I love this product and it makes my face smoother, but the vendor sent me free samples of other products that I like very much.</li>
            <li>Lastly, my husband who never notices anything commented that he could see a huge difference in my legs.  </li>
            <li>Got a FREE bottle of Facial Cleansing Gel with it.</li>
            <li>skin has started to really show improvement, and I am liking the feel of my skin</li>
            <li>I have used before \\&quot;Advanced Revitalift Anti-Aging Glycolic Mini-Peel Kit\\&quot; with 10% glycolic acid - from L&#x27;oreal\\&quot; which is only 14-15$ on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The gel doesn&#x27;t seem to do as much damage.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, if they do the same for all of their customers, you will receive some great, nearly full-sized samples of some of their other products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using other brands for many years but this surpassed my expectations.</li>
            <li>You can definitely spend more of your money without getting the same results from this glycolic acid peel.</li>
            <li>My skin looks a good 10 years younger, its smooth, stays hydrated, has only a few of the scaly patches left</li>
            <li>She said it was normal aging skin</li>
            <li>So naturally I had to let him in on the action!!!</li>
            <li>night, I rinse it off and when I rub it dry, the skin starts to peel and is sensitive, so rub lightly.  </li>
            <li>However; one should always let their skin adjust to new things before casting judgement.</li>
            <li>I live this product.</li>
            <li>Skin is smoother, pores are smaller and definite cell regeneration.&lt;br /&gt;Great free samples from the company as well.</li>
            <li>You definitely feel a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li>have also followed nearly every peel with the PH BALANCING toner that is also available from CELLBONE and find that this seems to stop the burning sensation, relieve the redness faster and put my face back into \\&quot;balance\\&quot; if there truly is such a thing.</li>
            <li>I am completely hooked for life!</li>
            <li>BUT  CLEAR  WATER STAIN.  </li>
            <li>I watch the  timer and prep neutralizer prior to application so I can rinse if tingling is too much.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, this product burns at every use, however</li>
            <li>, sometimes they fade away completely.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s life getting old.  </li>
            <li>Actually, I read the only review that stated this product is bottled water, but I said to my self that... only one bad review against so many other good reviews doesn&#x27;t count!!!</li>
            <li>So, all these products they claim are having high concentrations of glycolic acid, are BIG SCAMS !!!!!</li>
            <li>The skin under is sometimes a little shiny, but that goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li>The areas continue to flake slowly for a day or two, but if I scrub each morning, it looks fine.</li>
            <li>It made my forty two year old skin look at least five years younger and wonderfully smooth.  </li>
            <li>For instance, my cheeks and cheekbone area simply do not need frequent peeling, so I do a t-zone peel and avoid the areas of my face that don&#x27;t need it as often.</li>
            <li>All the hype about washing it off after several minutes, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>to note: I do NOT have overall sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t bare the thought of hiding my legs for the rest of my life.  </li>
            <li>After tremendous success, I went crazy, did my arms,</li>
            <li>I got duped again I left this on my skin for 20 minutes and all i felt was a light tingle I went for the 50% because of how weak the %20 percent salicylic acid peel from skin laboratory was.</li>

            <li> Lastly, my husband who never notices anything commented that he could see a huge difference in my legs.  </li>
            <li> Got a FREE bottle of Facial Cleansing Gel with it.</li>
            <li> skin has started to really show improvement, and I am liking the feel of my skin</li>
            <li> I have used before \\&quot;Advanced Revitalift Anti-Aging Glycolic Mini-Peel Kit\\&quot; with 10% glycolic acid - from L&#x27;oreal\\&quot; which is only 14-15$ on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The gel doesn&#x27;t seem to do as much damage.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, if they do the same for all of their customers, you will receive some great, nearly full-sized samples of some of their other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using other brands for many years but this surpassed my expectations.</li>
            <li> You can definitely spend more of your money without getting the same results from this glycolic acid peel.</li>
            <li> My skin looks a good 10 years younger, its smooth, stays hydrated, has only a few of the scaly patches left</li>
            <li> She said it was normal aging skin</li>
            <li> So naturally I had to let him in on the action!!!</li>
            <li> night, I rinse it off and when I rub it dry, the skin starts to peel and is sensitive, so rub lightly.  </li>
            <li> However; one should always let their skin adjust to new things before casting judgement.</li>
            <li> I live this product.</li>
            <li> Skin is smoother, pores are smaller and definite cell regeneration.&lt;br /&gt;Great free samples from the company as well.</li>
            <li> You definitely feel a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li> have also followed nearly every peel with the PH BALANCING toner that is also available from CELLBONE and find that this seems to stop the burning sensation, relieve the redness faster and put my face back into \\&quot;balance\\&quot; if there truly is such a thing.</li>
            <li> I am completely hooked for life!</li>
            <li> BUT  CLEAR  WATER STAIN.  </li>
            <li> I watch the  timer and prep neutralizer prior to application so I can rinse if tingling is too much.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, this product burns at every use, however</li>
            <li> , sometimes they fade away completely.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s life getting old.  </li>
            <li> Actually, I read the only review that stated this product is bottled water, but I said to my self that... only one bad review against so many other good reviews doesn&#x27;t count!!!</li>
            <li> So, all these products they claim are having high concentrations of glycolic acid, are BIG SCAMS !!!!!</li>
            <li> The skin under is sometimes a little shiny, but that goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li> The areas continue to flake slowly for a day or two, but if I scrub each morning, it looks fine.</li>
            <li> It made my forty two year old skin look at least five years younger and wonderfully smooth.  </li>
            <li> For instance, my cheeks and cheekbone area simply do not need frequent peeling, so I do a t-zone peel and avoid the areas of my face that don&#x27;t need it as often.</li>
            <li> All the hype about washing it off after several minutes, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> to note: I do NOT have overall sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t bare the thought of hiding my legs for the rest of my life.  </li>
            <li> After tremendous success, I went crazy, did my arms,</li>
            <li> I got duped again I left this on my skin for 20 minutes and all i felt was a light tingle I went for the 50% because of how weak the %20 percent salicylic acid peel from skin laboratory was.</li>
            <li> but after a few days I can use a scrub to exfoliate it off and see a fresh pink complexion.</li>
            <li> I admit I was skeptical about this product being able to lighten the dark pigmented spots that had developed on my forty-something face but thought that I would try a peel at home rather than spend a fortune at a spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, after about 6 weeks of use, 3 times a week or so, I see some improvement in the dark spots, but they are definitely still there.</li>
            <li> I put it on in the am and leave it till night -- only on areas of wrinkles -- NOT near eyes.  </li>
            <li> bought peel kits that are supposed to be far less concentrated.</li>
            <li> and so it has not been a problem for me that this burns a bit and leaves my skin a little red and dry in a couple of apparently slightly sensitive spots.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, those who have dry spots, consider using the peel less frequently on those areas.</li>
            <li> I have treated his 58 year old, spent a lot of time in the sun face, three times now!!!  </li>
            <li> As a military service member, they also gave me a discount card for my next purchase.</li>
            <li> But I am using it on other less sensitive areas of my body.  </li>
            <li> Yes I would recommend this you cant be a ninny its tough endurance for the first 5 minutes,</li>
            <li> A little red and dry around my nostrils.</li>
            <li> started with 3 minutes and worked up.&lt;br /&gt;Nicely packaged with some extra little gifts put in, and some of them I will probably order in the future.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As it has only been a few weeks for using this product 2 times a week, I have noticed a difference in my skin already.</li>
            <li> AGAIN ,  WAS  ONLY  PLAIN  WATER.  </li>
            <li> Cellbone also includes samples of other products in with your shipment, like a soothing green gel cleanser and facial toner.</li>
            <li> My skin tends to swell up like crazy even from the lightest \\&quot;lunchtime\\&quot; peels so at first I left the product on for a few minutes only.</li>
            <li> peels can be complicated if its  put over scars, under eyes, sensitive skin, if you have history of hyper pigmentation, it may result in darkening of the area if its not properly used ..  </li>
            <li> I bought this and use It when I make acne scarring and other dark spots</li>
            <li> sister-in-law has dark brown spots on her face from sun damage as a child and this got rid of it.</li>
            <li> This is a joke not worth the money at all</li>
            <li> I will tell you how I use this, but take it slowly because everyone&#x27;s skin is different.  </li>
            <li> Also chapstick on my lips and half-way down my chin and use this around my mouth for those lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried them out and will probably purchase a few other things from them as a result....</li>
            <li> I use chapstick heavily around the area to be treated so it will not &amp;#34;migrate&amp;#34; to other areas.  </li>
            <li> MESS  </li>
            <li> THE  MESS  </li>
            <li> skin feels/looks tight.</li>
            <li> If you have never gotten a peel before I would recommend getting a lower percentage peel gel as this one will be to harsh for the skin.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money</li>
            <li> Product is somewhat harsh so use as directed.</li>
            <li> I used Wichhazel with a cottonball over the skin, let it dry, applied the Cellbone glycolic acid with a fan brush, waited proper amount of time, hopped in the shower rinsed like mad, dried off, applied Cellbone neutralizer, waited 5 minutes-ish rinsed with wash cloth and used Acquaphor as moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Little things like that mean a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it for up to fifteen minutes at least twice a week.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product burned my skin and left an ugly dark scar on my face.  </li>
            <li> I have really bad Keratosis Pilaris on the backs of my arms, back, butt, and calves.  </li>
            <li> That being said, I am NO dermatologist, just someone who has tried a lot of products and has seen my sensitive-skinned friends do the same with painful results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also did a skin test in the bend of my elbow where the skin is thin to see what my reaction would be for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> Now do not get me wrong</li>
            <li> This product is a total crap and loss of money!</li>
            <li> I wanted to make my chicken pox scars fade away within time of using this...</li>
            <li> After time is up, I rinse like crazy and then apply alot of serums and creams to speed the repair.</li>
            <li> With some harsh chemical treatments a healing time is needed but this product will not interrupt your life at all!!!!!</li>
            <li> MAD.  </li>
            <li> SHOCKED  </li>
            <li> THIS  CRAP  IS  NOTHING  </li>
            <li> Even 20 % glycolic acid would be dangerous to be handled at home, think about 30, 40, 50, 70 % glycolic acid!!!!</li>
            <li> It does work, I just hate the fact that it burns sometimes!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is stronger and better than the expensive peels you can buy in Sephora. Not only do I love this product and it makes my face smoother, but the vendor sent me free samples of other products that I like very much. In short, this company has me hooked. As a military service member, they also gave me a discount card for my next purchase. Little things like that mean a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, those who have dry spots, consider using the peel less frequently on those areas. For instance, my cheeks and cheekbone area simply do not need frequent peeling, so I do a t-zone peel and avoid the areas of my face that don&#x27;t need it as often.</li>
            <li> This Peel Gel is very strong. everytime I use it I end up with some sort of adverse effect. If you have never gotten a peel before I would recommend getting a lower percentage peel gel as this one will be to harsh for the skin. I do not blame the seller or the product I blame myself for I should have gotten a lesser percentage peel gel something that my face would have been able to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: JANUARY 12, 2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now realize that I did not give an impartial review on this product. Now do not get me wrong this is a STRONG PEEL! However; one should always let their skin adjust to new things before casting judgement. Here is what happened. I allowed myself to heal after the first use, I did get scald the 1st time I used it, but after the peeling process began I noticed with the underlying skin that my marks was fading and my skin had a glow. So I waited for another month and did another session I got the scald but the healing time was well worth it since the peel, today I can say that all my marks have disappeared, my pores are noticeable smaller and my skin tone is smoother, much better than it was. Now the peel isn&#x27;t the only thing I was using, along with the vitamin C serum and cr&amp;egrave;me and following the instructions to a T along with allowing the healing process I can truly say I am pleased with the overall results of this product. it must be working as I said it is because my sister and her daughters  are now devoted users .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a panoply of Cellbone Technology products including this one. You can definitely spend more of your money without getting the same results from this glycolic acid peel. My regimen is: weekly peel, bi-weekly collagen masque with daily application of their excellent hyperpeptides liquid in combination with their stem cell lotion.   I brought these products to my plastic surgeon and she was duly impressed with the potency of these products. I can tell you that it has made a huge difference in the texture of my skin and wrinkles? Well, a couple of friends commented that I keep looking younger and younger.   These products are well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Pleased with entire purchase. Got a FREE bottle of Facial Cleansing Gel with it.</li>
            <li> It works for freckles, acne, sun damaged skin. Make sure you wear a good sunscreen when you use this product and apply the sunscreen 15 minutes before you go out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister-in-law has dark brown spots on her face from sun damage as a child and this got rid of it.</li>
            <li> This peel is strong.  Clean and exfoliate your face prior to use for best results.  I can feel an immediate tingling when I apply. I watch the  timer and prep neutralizer prior to application so I can rinse if tingling is too much.  Leaves my face very smooth.</li>
            <li> I started at 35% and now using 50%.  I like how gentle but effective this peel is..it does sting and can get intense if you leave it on too long.&lt;br /&gt;I started with 3 minutes and worked up.&lt;br /&gt;Nicely packaged with some extra little gifts put in, and some of them I will probably order in the future.&lt;br /&gt;My skin has started to really show improvement, and I am liking the feel of my skin again.&lt;br /&gt;Do not over do, if you are using this product more than once a week you are not giving your new skin a chance to develop and grow.&lt;br /&gt;Love it</li>
            <li> This product is a total crap and loss of money! I bought it because of the good reviews, but I was deceived. Actually, I read the only review that stated this product is bottled water, but I said to my self that... only one bad review against so many other good reviews doesn&#x27;t count!!! Well, it counts now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I have used before \\&quot;Advanced Revitalift Anti-Aging Glycolic Mini-Peel Kit\\&quot; with 10% glycolic acid - from L&#x27;oreal\\&quot; which is only 14-15$ on Amazon. L&#x27;Oreal really worked and I wanted  to use something more concentrated, so I bought this  with the \\&quot;Neutralizer\\&quot; from Cellbone. I wanted to make my chicken pox scars fade away within time of using this... What a waist of money... This product it&#x27;s not even 10 % glycolic acid, since I&#x27;ve used L&#x27;oreal 10 % before so, I know what to expect...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have thought twice before making this purchase. In my opinion, no company affords being sued just because someone got a sever burn from their products. Even 20 % glycolic acid would be dangerous to be handled at home, think about 30, 40, 50, 70 % glycolic acid!!!! So, all these products they claim are having high concentrations of glycolic acid, are BIG SCAMS !!!!!</li>
            <li> As it has only been a few weeks for using this product 2 times a week, I have noticed a difference in my skin already. I use the other 2 products that came along and as using as described I am quite happy with the results so far. I would surely recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> Works great, may go with 30% next time for my face however.</li>
            <li> I use this to fade sun spots on my face and legs...works...must use a few times for best results...don&#x27;t leave on too long...can burn</li>
            <li> I got duped again I left this on my skin for 20 minutes and all i felt was a light tingle I went for the 50% because of how weak the %20 percent salicylic acid peel from skin laboratory was. This is a joke not worth the money at all I have had better results from store bought peel kits that are supposed to be far less concentrated.</li>
            <li> I received this product 3 days ago and I am a first time user. No sting--nothing. I assume I should feel something if it is working. All the hype about washing it off after several minutes, sensitive skin. This product has the strength of water. Do I send it back? Glad I did not spend any more than I did. Maybe the price is the lure.</li>
            <li> this is not as strong as the medium med peel, so use 2-4 applications</li>
            <li> This is a great product. You definitely feel a difference after the first use. Skin is smoother, pores are smaller and definite cell regeneration.&lt;br /&gt;Great free samples from the company as well. Worth it.</li>
            <li> yes it is a acid and yes it will  exfoliate the skin  , which is why i promoted it 5 stars but i recommended  seeing a dermatologist first  or someone else to assist with the chemical peeling...  glycolic  peels can be complicated if its  put over scars, under eyes, sensitive skin, if you have history of hyper pigmentation, it may result in darkening of the area if its not properly used ..  it did what it said, the skin did peel off but now with a scab over it ... i suggest trying  it first in a small none noticeable ... if there any complication , go to a dermatologist  to see if he or she an assist the matter because it is very affective if everything goes well , also if the area which you want to be peeled  is large, i 100% recommend someone else assisting you with the peel.&lt;br /&gt; yes this product worth the buy if you want the skin to peel off.</li>
            <li> Second time that I use this product and it does a great job. After one application you can see the difference. I used it on my mom&#x27;s hads and it soften some of the sun spots, she is very happy with the results. I wil buy it again as soon as I am done with this botle.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find the 35% on Amazon, so I&#x27;m leaving my review here. I ordered Prep and Neutralize and received 1/2 oz samples of the 35% Peel and the Collagen Mask (fantastic sample sizes!) I used everything in accordance with the instructions. The first day was great. A little red and dry around my nostrils. Great results. Used Prep 2x a day, as indicated and did peel #2 one week later, as indicated. I avoided the skin around my nostrils, but ended up getting burned around my nose and mouth. Some of my pores were actually bleeding. Felt like a Samantha moment. Did it last night and my face hurts! Think I will cut back to only one peel a month (instead of weekly) and leave it on for 1-2 min, instead of the 4-5 they recommend. Prep alone, gave me amazing results. Love the collagen mask, too. Will definitely buy from Cellbone again.</li>
            <li> This product is really good. I&#x27;ve been using other brands for many years but this surpassed my expectations. It is very strong. I have used twice a week and only leave on the skin for 4 minutes. Also use the neutralizer and the collagen tonic (both came as gifts with the purchase). I totally recommend it!</li>
            <li> I just received this product and being a person who needs to try it for myself, I decided to do the back of my hand before proceeding to my face.  Three minutes max time.  I could not believe the difference!  Asked my husband to look and right away he could see and feel the change on my hand.  Can&#x27;t wait to try it on my face.</li>
            <li> THIS  CRAP  IS  NOTHING  BUT  CLEAR  WATER STAIN.  IT  HAD  NOTHING  STRONG  OR  STINGING  I  KNOW  A  CHEMICAL  SUBSTANCE  WOULD  HAVE,  AND  I HAVE  TRIED  THEM.  EVEN  FREEZONE  WOULD  HAVE  POWER  AND  BURN  ONES  SKIN  LIKE  FIRE,  THIS  WATER  MESS  FROM  CELLBONE  CALLED  GLYCOLIC  ACID  LIED  TO  ME  THE  NIGHT  I  PUT  THAT  JUNK  ON  MY  SKIN.  FOLKS  THIS  IS  SHOCKED  ME  AGAIN ,  WAS  ONLY  PLAIN  WATER.  IAM  MAD.  I  WOULD  LOVE  TO  GET  MONEY  BACK,  BUT  THEY  SENT  THE  MESS  TO  ME  FREE.  PEOPLE  YOU  BETTER  BEWARE  WITH  SOME  OF  THESE  PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to use and you will soon see results if the directions are followed. My skin looks so much more radiant, I&#x27;d recommend this if you need a gradual exfoliation.  With some harsh chemical treatments a healing time is needed but this product will not interrupt your life at all!!!!!</li>
            <li> I live this product. It made my forty two year old skin look at least five years younger and wonderfully smooth.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I admit I was skeptical about this product being able to lighten the dark pigmented spots that had developed on my forty-something face but thought that I would try a peel at home rather than spend a fortune at a spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My results? So far, after about 6 weeks of use, 3 times a week or so, I see some improvement in the dark spots, but they are definitely still there. The tone and texture of my skin does seem smoother and brighter so I do believe it is working well as an exfoliant. I do wish it had done MORE for improving pigment, but I will continue to use it and hopefully with more time it will lighten the dark spots even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even after 6 weeks time, I still have more than 1/2 of a bottle left, so as far as value is concerned, it is definitely worth the price of giving it a try since you will be able to give it a good long trial if you wish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT to note: I do NOT have overall sensitive skin and so it has not been a problem for me that this burns a bit and leaves my skin a little red and dry in a couple of apparently slightly sensitive spots. If you tend to burn easily, have an aversion to mild pain or have very dry skin, I don&#x27;t know that I would try this if I were you. That being said, I am NO dermatologist, just someone who has tried a lot of products and has seen my sensitive-skinned friends do the same with painful results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also followed nearly every peel with the PH BALANCING toner that is also available from CELLBONE and find that this seems to stop the burning sensation, relieve the redness faster and put my face back into \\&quot;balance\\&quot; if there truly is such a thing. I would recommend purchasing them together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, if they do the same for all of their customers, you will receive some great, nearly full-sized samples of some of their other products. I have tried them out and will probably purchase a few other things from them as a result....so for the money, give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say you will have fabulous results but it will not cost a fortune to find out and you may love just having more radiant skin!ay you will have fabulous results but it will not cost a fortune to find out and you may love just having more radiant skin!</li>
            <li> Works great. I&#x27;ve been using a lesser concentration for a year and love this more potent formulation for my face.</li>
            <li> Perfect and no to spencer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used glycolic acids before and this one does not do a thing its supposed to. Dont waste your money</li>
            <li> I will tell you how I use this, but take it slowly because everyone&#x27;s skin is different.  I have worked up to this method over several month&#x27;s of trial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this on my face once a month.  I put it on in the am and leave it till night -- only on areas of wrinkles -- NOT near eyes.  I use chapstick heavily around the area to be treated so it will not &amp;#34;migrate&amp;#34; to other areas.  I put chapstick in a line above my eyebrows and use the acid on my forehead.  Also chapstick on my lips and half-way down my chin and use this around my mouth for those lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That night, I rinse it off and when I rub it dry, the skin starts to peel and is sensitive, so rub lightly.  Over the next 24 hours, the top layer sheds in strips.  24 hrs after rinsing I give the area a good rub (even with a scrubber) and more skin comes off.  The skin under is sometimes a little shiny, but that goes away quickly.  The areas continue to flake slowly for a day or two, but if I scrub each morning, it looks fine.</li>
            <li> Product is somewhat harsh so use as directed. I have sensitive skin, this product burns at every use, however, you must build up to the time left on face. It has cleared acne that were beginning to bulge out of my skin. it clears a zit at most 2 days. I love this product. When I re-purchase, i will repurchase a lower dosage like 35.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product burned my skin and left an ugly dark scar on my face.  I&#x27;ve always had sensitive skin, so I should have known this product might have been too strong.  But after reading all the reviews, no one else seemed to have a problem with burning, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  Now I regret it.  I&#x27;ll never use this on my face again.  But I am using it on other less sensitive areas of my body.  I have really bad Keratosis Pilaris on the backs of my arms, back, butt, and calves.  I&#x27;m hoping the glycolic acid will help exfoliate that.</li>
            <li> Worked...will order again!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this peel! After spending money and experiencing up to a week&#x27;s downtime from peels at the dermatologist&#x27;s office, I was excited to try this product. My skin tends to swell up like crazy even from the lightest \\&quot;lunchtime\\&quot; peels so at first I left the product on for a few minutes only. It&#x27;s not like it peels the skin immediately but after a few days I can use a scrub to exfoliate it off and see a fresh pink complexion. I use it for up to fifteen minutes at least twice a week. It is great because you get the effect of a major peel in a few mini-peels. The bottle has lasted me over a year. Cellbone also includes samples of other products in with your shipment, like a soothing green gel cleanser and facial toner. I am completely hooked for life!</li>
            <li> This is good peel to get started but be careful and follow instructions and always purchase the neutralizer. I got the product on time and will purchase from this seller again.</li>

            <li> Hi, I never write reviews, but I LOVE this product so much I had to share.  I&#x27;m 47 Years old, have enjoyed beautiful skin most of my life. My sun exposure has varied through the years.  I&#x27;ve vasilated from lots of sun beds to years of zero tanning.  In the last year my legs began to take on a scaly appearance that wouldn&#x27;t go away.  I would exfoliate, tried a variety of over the counter creams, did an IPL twice at a medi spa and went to see my dermatologist.  She said it was normal aging skin and that&#x27;s life getting old.  What???  I couldn&#x27;t bare the thought of hiding my legs for the rest of my life.  That&#x27;s when I got the idea to try a peel on my legs.  I began with the Cellbone 35% peel.  I used Wichhazel with a cottonball over the skin, let it dry, applied the Cellbone glycolic acid with a fan brush, waited proper amount of time, hopped in the shower rinsed like mad, dried off, applied Cellbone neutralizer, waited 5 minutes-ish rinsed with wash cloth and used Acquaphor as moisturizer.  After tremendous success, I went crazy, did my arms, my back, my face and ordered the stronger 50% and used it too.  It says it can be used 1-2x weekly.  My goals is get my skin looking great, probably another 4 peels and then back off to a 1-2x per month maintenance.  BTW, I DID do a test patch with both the 35% and 50% peels prior to slathering all over. My skin looks a good 10 years younger, its smooth, stays hydrated, has only a few of the scaly patches left (they will be gone soon)the overall tone is even, brown spots have faded or gone, and it&#x27;s a prettier color, even without any tan.  I love the Cellbone products so much I ordered a bunch of stuff for my face, nightime moisurizer and more and love it all!!!!!!  Lastly, my husband who never notices anything commented that he could see a huge difference in my legs.  So naturally I had to let him in on the action!!! I have treated his 58 year old, spent a lot of time in the sun face, three times now!!!  (But with him I&#x27;ve stayed witht the 35%)  He looks better now than he did after a package of 3 IPL and 3 Clear Brilliant Lazers and a medi spa.  Besides the improvement, the convenience of doing this at home, I&#x27;ve also saved tons of $$$$$.  Honestly, I can&#x27;t rave enough, it&#x27;s like magic!!!  Good luck and I hope everyone else benefits like we have!!!!  Blessings to all!!!d witht the 35%)  He looks better now than he did after a package of 3 IPL and 3 Clear Brilliant Lazers and a medi spa.

            <li> I purchased the Cellbone Glycolic 50%Peel gel with the neutralizer I would order these products again and again. I received a couple of products as a gift of purchase.  My skin looks FAB I get so many compliments I owe it all to Cellbone.</li>
            <li> Gel forms are the best, but keep in mind that this IS an ACID. I worked my way up from weaker acids to stronger. The gel doesn&#x27;t seem to do as much damage. I also did a skin test in the bend of my elbow where the skin is thin to see what my reaction would be for 3 minutes. I never leave the bathroom sink area (in case I need a quick rinse) and I always keep a bottle of baking soda and water for a quick neutralizer. I do my face about once every 2 weeks, varying the kinds of acids I do use. After time is up, I rinse like crazy and then apply alot of serums and creams to speed the repair.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few years now and I am convinced it really does make a difference.  When I don&#x27;t use it I can see how much a difference it does make!</li>
