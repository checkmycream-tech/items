            <li>Like fresh flowers.  </li>
            <li>So I have to make some masks time to tie, but the other then that it is a good product</li>
            <li>BIOTA.SHIPPING IS SUPER FAST .</li>

            <li>so much so that my barber couldn&#x27;t believe it!  </li>
            <li>though the tarry color is a bit off-putting at first.</li>
            <li>i had result After first time using shampoo</li>
            <li>this is the first review i have ever wrote thank you again</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the product but am reducing one star because I do not like the way that it smells... it doesn&#x27;t have a typical shampoo odor</li>
            <li>No more problem in finding good stuff (maybe because this one is made in Turkey and only sold in US - the US companies have no clue - apparently - how to make good shampoos)</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel and look much thicker.</li>
            <li>My husband has very thing hair and he really mentioned that has notice some improvement.</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT.THE SHAMPOO HAS A BROWN LOOK,BUT HAS A VERY PLEASENT AROMA.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair much fuller in appearance, and shiny.  </li>
            <li>but I expected more and without my hair feeling super-dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>- that is the product that works very well, for this type of scalp.</li>
            <li>not seeing much results after 30 days.</li>
            <li>Hair is not breaking as much and looks fuller.</li>
            <li>it you some BIOTA SHAMPOO FAST</li>
            <li>I really like how it smells and the brown color</li>
            <li>It good when used together with serum , takes 3 months at least</li>
            <li>My super oliy hair wouldn&#x27;t last 6hrs without this shampoo.</li>
            <li>,MY HAIR HAS NOT LOOKED,FELT THIS GOOD,SINCE I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL.NOW</li>
            <li>Needed the one for normal hair.</li>
            <li>I ORDER MY NEW BOTTLE OF SHAMPOO.</li>
            <li>it only kept my hair non-oily for about a day (which is much better then other shampoos)</li>
            <li>This product leaves your hair soft and even voluminous.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I recommend you combine with a thickening hair gel or hair spray to really see a big difference.</li>
            <li>My husband and I we are both using it and like so far.</li>
            <li>AND WOW AFTER A MONTH I CAN SEE THE DIFFRENCE</li>
            <li>product seems to make my hair thicker; it is still so soft that barrettes slide out, but it appears fuller.</li>
            <li>I have been suffered all my life of seborrheic and oily hair as same today but this help me so much</li>
            <li>Using this shampoo actually helps my hair last 12hrs fresh.</li>
            <li>Forget using combs, barrettes or hair ornaments they simply slide down to the ends and fall out because my hair is so soft and fine.</li>
            <li>, I feel too me its still thin on top</li>
            <li>shampoo does not lather much, and it does not seem to treat the &amp;#34;oiliness&amp;#34; of my hair as well as some other shampoos marketed for the purpose; I usually have to wash twice in order to clean it fully.</li>
            <li>; smell that&#x27;s not especially weird, good or bad--</li>
            <li>The US-sold shampoos (at any supermarket or a barber shop) do not distinguish between shampoos for \\&quot;dry, normal and oily hair\\&quot;, which in turn is a norm in Europe.</li>
            <li>cause i have spent so much money on different products@this</li>
            <li>Personally does not dry my hair out like others have reported.  </li>
            <li>my thin hair nice, but not really thicker yet !!  </li>

            <li> my thin hair nice, but not really thicker yet !!  </li>
            <li> looks oily the next morning and does dry out my ends</li>
            <li> WHEN MY OLD ONE IS HALF WAYS.</li>
            <li> So my wife has spent quite some time looking for a shampoo, dedicated to oily hairs (and we live in US for well over a decade now) - with no success.</li>
            <li> Now as a senior citizen (albeit young in heart and mind), my hair is blond, white, fine, thin, and oily enough that I could literally wash it twice a day--no product seems to slow down the oil.</li>
            <li> I think this will work for the long haul, hopefully.</li>
            <li> I get an extra day with this shampoo that the other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried didn&#x27;t give me.</li>
            <li> Yes, you may run into \\&quot;dry and damaged hair\\&quot;, but that&#x27;s just about it.</li>
            <li> Luckily, a little bit goes a long way for my short pixie cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I makes my hair over dry!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a month and a half</li>
            <li> but I can already tell less hair is left in my shower, comb etc.  </li>
            <li> Sadly I have had fine, thin, oily blonde hair my entire life.</li>
            <li> It is so hard to find any shampoos for oily hair, this one is not a miracle for oiliness, but at least it seems to leave my hair clean and less itchy.</li>
            <li> While I have nothing to compare to, my shedding has been minimal, so</li>
            <li> I see some minimal hair growth, some bald spots filling in.</li>
            <li> We had to buy and bring them in the ethnic stores (which is difficult in a remote place we live) or back from our country,</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have hair loss due to thyroid problems, and this shampoo seems to help with it.</li>
            <li> Yes, they recommend not using conditioners or other products on your hair but you will no longer need other products.</li>
            <li> No other shampoo bought here could match even closely the quality and effects of any decent shampoo from Europe (Poland in our case), even an expensive stuff (\\&quot;brands\\&quot; mean very little in this respect, apparently).</li>
            <li> In my younger years I longed for the flowing thick locks that I saw in hair product commercials-unfortunately it was not meant to be.</li>
            <li> but I am using this product for some years and my hair loss decreased considerably</li>
            <li> Less hair in the tub and on the floor.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical this product will work for me, but was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> My hair has stopped falling out, no more hair in the sink, all over my body after washing my hair, no more strands of hair on my hair brush since I started using Biota.</li>
            <li> works(at least in the past).</li>
            <li> For a man with thinning hair,  confidence is hard to come by.</li>
            <li> I bought this after bariatric surgery, as hair loss is quite common at the 3-4 month mark</li>
            <li> Nothing and I do mean nothing has worked for me until now!</li>
            <li> have got thin hair</li>
            <li> im still skeptical</li>
            <li> my hair was falling out really bad</li>
            <li> This shampoo disappointed me.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> well my husband says it feels thicker im still skeptical , I feel too me its still thin on top looks oily the next morning and does dry out my ends so I have to condition my ends</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel and look much thicker. I have fine hair that gets oily as the day goes along. With this it doesn&#x27;t get as oily. On my second bottle and would recommend.</li>
            <li> After 3 months, I do not see a difference with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice.</li>
            <li> just ok. gives rich lather. smell is ok. helped my oily hair but has lots of chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> This product leaves your hair soft and even voluminous.&lt;br /&gt;I have got thin hair and I can tell you it makes a difference!</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for just over a month now and my hair is noticeably thicker... so much so that my barber couldn&#x27;t believe it!  I am very pleased with the product but am reducing one star because I do not like the way that it smells... it doesn&#x27;t have a typical shampoo odor and I find myself holding my breath while I rinse it out of my hair.  I can put up with the smell to get the thickness results.  I recommend you combine with a thickening hair gel or hair spray to really see a big difference.</li>
            <li> really good for oily hair</li>
            <li> Great product, really adds volume. You have to use it on its own for it to work well.</li>
            <li> I makes my hair over dry! So I have to make some masks time to tie, but the other then that it is a good product</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing, use it twice a day and you will see major results!  NOBS!</li>
            <li> I heard about this product on radio commercial and I thought to give a try. My husband and I we are both using it and like so far. My husband has very thing hair and he really mentioned that has notice some improvement.</li>
            <li> This shampoo disappointed me. It did not give me the volume I had hoped for nor did it keep my hair from getting oily later in the day. I will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> ALL I HAVE TO SAY,IS LOOK NO MORE.THIS SHAMPOO IS MAGIC. I DON&#x27;T KNOW WHAT IT&#x27;S MADE OF ,BUT IT WORKS.I STARTED USING THIS PRODUCT WITH THE SERUM. AND WOW AFTER A MONTH I CAN SEE THE DIFFRENCE .MY HAIR IS THICKER FULLER AND HEALTHIER,MY HAIR HAS NOT LOOKED,FELT THIS GOOD,SINCE I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL.NOW MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER USE THIS PRODUCT.THE SHAMPOO HAS A BROWN LOOK,BUT HAS A VERY PLEASENT AROMA. THANKYOU . BIOTA.SHIPPING IS SUPER FAST . I ORDER MY NEW BOTTLE OF SHAMPOO. WHEN MY OLD ONE IS HALF WAYS. THAT WAY NEVER RUN OUT.</li>
            <li> Just using it for oil. I get an extra day with this shampoo that the other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried didn&#x27;t give me.</li>
            <li> My super oliy hair wouldn&#x27;t last 6hrs without this shampoo. Using this shampoo actually helps my hair last 12hrs fresh. Also its pretty mild so my super sensitive allergic scalp wouldn&#x27;t be bothered.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair much fuller in appearance, and shiny.  Personally does not dry my hair out like others have reported.  My hair still gets oily by the next day.  On my third bottle</li>
            <li> I was skeptical this product will work for me, but was pleasantly surprised. I have hair loss due to thyroid problems, and this shampoo seems to help with it. I still have to use an anti-dandruff shampoo now and then, though. It is so hard to find any shampoos for oily hair, this one is not a miracle for oiliness, but at least it seems to leave my hair clean and less itchy.</li>
            <li> Sadly I have had fine, thin, oily blonde hair my entire life. In my younger years I longed for the flowing thick locks that I saw in hair product commercials-unfortunately it was not meant to be. Now as a senior citizen (albeit young in heart and mind), my hair is blond, white, fine, thin, and oily enough that I could literally wash it twice a day--no product seems to slow down the oil. Forget using combs, barrettes or hair ornaments they simply slide down to the ends and fall out because my hair is so soft and fine. Some products seemed to thicken my hair until the oil set in then they just made my head itchy. Enough of the gross details.&lt;br /&gt;This product seems to make my hair thicker; it is still so soft that barrettes slide out, but it appears fuller. However if possible, my hair seems even oilier. I have only been using it for about 2 weeks, so I will continue until the bottle is empty and make my decision then whether to continue use or keep searching for the elusive perfect product.</li>
            <li> i love this shampoo. I have been suffered all my life of seborrheic and oily hair as same today but this help me so much</li>
            <li> I noticed my hair falling out rapidly. I realized after a fashion that Wen shampoo can do this to your hair. Since July of 2012, I have been using Biota shampoo and serum. What a pleasant difference. Less hair in the tub and on the floor. Plus, my hair looks and feels great. Alot fuller.</li>
            <li> I bought this after bariatric surgery, as hair loss is quite common at the 3-4 month mark and I&#x27;d like to prevent it. While I have nothing to compare to, my shedding has been minimal, so no complaints there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo does not lather much, and it does not seem to treat the &amp;#34;oiliness&amp;#34; of my hair as well as some other shampoos marketed for the purpose; I usually have to wash twice in order to clean it fully. Luckily, a little bit goes a long way for my short pixie cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s not a terribly noticeable scent-- just a generic &amp;#34;herbal shampoo&amp;#34; smell that&#x27;s not especially weird, good or bad-- though the tarry color is a bit off-putting at first.</li>
            <li> He swears his hair isn&#x27;t thinning at the rate it was. For a man with thinning hair,  confidence is hard to come by.</li>
            <li> Good product used and know it works(at least in the past). It good when used together with serum , takes 3 months at least</li>
            <li> Once the dry-feeling ended my hair was oily again... it only kept my hair non-oily for about a day (which is much better then other shampoos) but I expected more and without my hair feeling super-dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in it making my hair thicker but didn&#x27;t buy it for that just for oiliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients are not listed so here they are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Biocomplex B11 Herbal Extract (Urtica Urens Leaf Extract, Urtica Dioica [Nettle] Root Extract, Chamomilla Recutita [Matricaria] Flower Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Ceratonia Siliqua [Carob] Fruit Extract, Equisetum Arvense Extract), Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Propylene Glycol, Mel, Sodium Chloride, PEG/PPG-120/10 Trimethylolpropane Trioleate, Laureth-2, Polysorbate 20, Fragrance, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Hydroxypropyl Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Butylene Glycol, Amodimethicone, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG 40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, C11-15 Pareth-7, Laureth-9, Glycerin, Trideceth-12, Apigenin, Oleanolic Acid, Biotinoyl Tripeptide-1, Geraniol, Citronellol, Benzyl Alcohol, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Citric Acid.</li>
            <li> For all the fellow Europeans that have had the same struggle like us, living for a while in the Uncle Sam&#x27;s land. The US-sold shampoos (at any supermarket or a barber shop) do not distinguish between shampoos for \\&quot;dry, normal and oily hair\\&quot;, which in turn is a norm in Europe. Yes, you may run into \\&quot;dry and damaged hair\\&quot;, but that&#x27;s just about it. The hair hygiene culture here is quite, well..., undemanding, if I may. So my wife has spent quite some time looking for a shampoo, dedicated to oily hairs (and we live in US for well over a decade now) - with no success. No other shampoo bought here could match even closely the quality and effects of any decent shampoo from Europe (Poland in our case), even an expensive stuff (\\&quot;brands\\&quot; mean very little in this respect, apparently). We had to buy and bring them in the ethnic stores (which is difficult in a remote place we live) or back from our country, when travelling.&lt;br /&gt;Here, however, Amazon finally came to the rescue. This shampoo is what it says it is - for oily hair and works just like the ones dedicated to it! No more problem in finding good stuff (maybe because this one is made in Turkey and only sold in US - the US companies have no clue - apparently - how to make good shampoos) - that is the product that works very well, for this type of scalp. My wife, being an owner of beautiful, long hair is in full agreement :-)!</li>
            <li> My hair always felt clean after shampooing, but I did not see any results for volume or thicknes</li>
            <li> I thought it would make my hair feel thicker and it has not done so yet.  I am still going to give it some time to work with the serum.</li>
            <li> Of course it does not produce any miracles but I am using this product for some years and my hair loss decreased considerably</li>
            <li> I have tried everything under the sun for my thinning hair. Nothing and I do mean nothing has worked for me until now! I am so excited about this product. My hair was falling out in strands. Every time I washed my hair, combed it or even just touched it it would fall out. My sink was constantly clogged with hair. I have bald areas and I was really starting to be quite embarrassed by my balding head. My hair has stopped falling out, no more hair in the sink, all over my body after washing my hair, no more strands of hair on my hair brush since I started using Biota. I use the shampoo and the serum. My hair is growing faster than before using this product. Yes, they recommend not using conditioners or other products on your hair but you will no longer need other products. My hair is nice and smooth, not dry. I see some minimal hair growth, some bald spots filling in. Not a lot but some is better than nothing. I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about one month but I intend to use this forever and nothing else. It&#x27;s great....Oh and for the ding dong that can&#x27;t figure out how to get the serum out of the bottle..all you needed to do was read the instructions! PRESS THE BOTTOM OF THE SERUM BOTTLE AND THE SERUM COMES OUT!</li>
            <li> did not see any effect</li>
            <li> not seeing much results after 30 days.</li>
            <li> My hair looks so much healthier and is more manageable,  very pleased with the results. Try it and you&#x27;ll see</li>
            <li> My hair is fuller and thicker and this is what is making that happen.  I have tried everything to thicken my hair and nothing until this.  Not to mention it smells great.</li>
            <li> This Shampoo smells so good and fresh. Like fresh flowers.  I have used it for a couple months. It&lt;br /&gt;leaves my thin hair nice, but not really thicker yet !!  A little goes a long way.  I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Hair is not breaking as much and looks fuller.</li>
            <li> I would just like to&lt;br /&gt;say thank you for this shampoo i had result After first time using shampoo my hair was falling out really bad now i dont see any of hair in my brush or comb but 1 or 2 stands of hair so i had to write this review to say this shampoo was a god sent for my hair this is the first review i have ever wrote thank you again cause i have spent so much money on different products@this is the only one that work@if you have dermatitis and your hair is falling out run@go it you some BIOTA SHAMPOO FAST</li>
            <li> Great product, organic, clean, and works fine. Arrived on time, price is good, and pretty decent quality. I love it</li>
            <li> Jury is still out.  I let my wife use this one.  I prefer Therapy-G For Thinning or Fine Hair Antioxidant Shampoo</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a month and a half but I can already tell less hair is left in my shower, comb etc.  I think this will work for the long haul, hopefully.</li>
            <li> Great product I can feel a difference</li>
            <li> I had hairfall because of this shampoo. My hair become thinner and weaker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 weeks now and I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable difference in my hair yet. I suffer from oily and thinning hair so I thought I would give this product a try. My hair looks great most of the day until late afternoon when it begins to be oily again. The thinning part will probably take longer than 2 weeks to see any results. I will continue to use the bottle and see if my results improve. The shampoo smells good too. To me it kind of smells like baby powder.</li>
            <li> it was for oily hair with I cannot use on my thinning hair. Needed the one for normal hair. I will say the seller was very good. got the item quickly and allowed the return with not problem and the credit made to my acct immediately.  Seller gets 5 stars</li>
            <li> I really like how it smells and the brown color</li>
    </ol>
