            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure it was legit due to the price. I compared this to my other bottle of Eros and it&#x27;s the same... I only wish I could buy 3 more, but they&#x27;re sold out! No kidding!!!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell like the one you would find at Macy&#x27;s or Sephora.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for my husband for Christmas. The fragrance is wonderful and lasts longer than the majority of men&#x27;s colognes. These are the large-sized bottles of the cologne and shower gel: there is a generous quantity of both. The price for this gift set was a bargain, and I am very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice for gentalmen.</li>
            <li> Everyone comments on how good this scent is!! Your significant other will really love this one!</li>
            <li> Lightning fast delivery. Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Got as a gift. Not complaints</li>
            <li> Received in a timely manner. The fragrance was what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Theres nothing like and intoxicating scent.  Love this fragrance on him!</li>
            <li> I work in a bank and sometimes the air conditioning breaks.  So,  I&#x27;d keep this in my car and it does a great job of covering up unwanted odors while leaving me smelling success.</li>
            <li> The product was so disappointing. I gave it to my 20 year old son. He&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t wear it either!  Oh well.....</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase and the quantity</li>
            <li> Does not last as long... Won&#x27;t buy again!</li>
            <li> very, very, very please thank you</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne as a gift for my brother because I liked the way it smelled since my husband has the same one. Delivery was super fast, item came as described, huge package for the price!! however I am not sure about the smell. My husband owns the same cologne and his seems to be more of a stronger musky smell that lasts longer. I sprayed his and this one on each of my hands, and my husbands lasted longer. So I&#x27;m skeptical to as of if this is legit or no. :-(</li>
            <li> Love the smell. The iteam arrive sooner then I expected. I bought it for my husband and he loves it.. And I love it on him ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
