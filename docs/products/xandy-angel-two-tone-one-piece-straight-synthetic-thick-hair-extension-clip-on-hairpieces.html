            <li>This is a great price, I would love to be able to order a custom color one though, so I could get my red/purple ones too.</li>
            <li>Looks nice.</li>
            <li>Glad to have bought a nice product.</li>
            <li>so bright and pretty!!</li>
            <li>Super nice salespeople.</li>
            <li>the color is very true to the picture.</li>
            <li>I would call it a light magenta?</li>
            <li>This produce came in perfect condition and I wear them in my hair everyday.</li>
            <li>awesome came in very early took only 11 days!</li>
            <li>I GOT THE RED WHINE PURPLE COLOR AND ITS SO BRIGHT.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soo full.</li>
            <li>best for people with already thick hair.</li>
            <li>but I still looks very good and even if its a little off it looks more natural like that.</li>
            <li>I purchased the rose red to dark purple and GIRL, the colors are so vivid and perfectly blend together in ombre.</li>
            <li>the color I got was rose red to purple.</li>
            <li>nice long extension, VERY soft :)</li>
            <li>Looks better than the picture, arrived on time, and was better quality than I expected!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s going to take correct placement and styling for the right effect.</li>
            <li>So it doesn&#x27;t match my red hair at all,either way I love it and am gonna put some purple in it,so it will blend with the purple bottom.</li>
            <li>I ordered the rose red to purple, but instead I go the dark purple to light purple.</li>
            <li>Much longer hair than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>its very shiny and doesnt blend well.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s thick, and the clips at the top were really secure.</li>
            <li>THEY LOOK LIKE REAL HAIR AND EVEN SOFT LIKE REAL HAIR.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product it isn&#x27;t shiny</li>
            <li>The only bummer is,the rose red really isn&#x27;t red at all.</li>
            <li>It is insanely long,I thought  it&#x27;d fit my hair perfect</li>
            <li>the hair is soft and thick.&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li>These DO however, need to be trimmed and styled to suit and compliment your natural hair.</li>
            <li>love it, it was a little long for my hair</li>
            <li>and I was really surprised especially because of the price</li>
            <li>Ships much faster than I expected.</li>
            <li>Exactly what i expected!!</li>
            <li>Otherwise, they were thick and true to colour.</li>

            <li> Pretty colors but hard to pull off, especially if your hair is layered.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a tad long</li>
            <li> Also, this came two weeks earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> She loves it long hair &amp; stayed in her hair all day.</li>
            <li> Be prepared to trim it because the piece is very long.</li>
            <li> it was very long</li>
            <li> its soooo long!!!</li>
            <li> THEY ARE SO SOFT AND THICK.</li>
            <li> but all I did was cut it down to size.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s going to look very fake and very tacky.</li>
            <li> warning though, VERY thick.</li>
            <li> Looks very fake and hard to blend into hair types.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this, for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I just was silly and didn&#x27;t try to measure when I should have.</li>
            <li> Very fake plastic looking, so unhappy with it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let any of the pictures fool you, it does not look like that, it looks like one of those fake anime wigs!</li>

            <li> awesome came in very early took only 11 days! so bright and pretty!! love it, it was a little long for my hair so i shorted it. but its still so pretty love it!!!!</li>

            <li> My GF loves it... This was a gift for her and I was not dissapointed...</li>
            <li> nice long extension, VERY soft :)</li>
            <li> I got the purple Hair and I was really surprised especially because of the price but it was nice...</li>
            <li> I ordered the rose red to purple, but instead I go the dark purple to light purple. This is not what I ordered.</li>
            <li> its soooo long!!! the hair is soft and thick.&lt;br /&gt;its not cray thick.&lt;br /&gt;its perfect thick.&lt;br /&gt;overall its really awesome and  yesss lol</li>
            <li> I purchased the rose red to dark purple and GIRL, the colors are so vivid and perfectly blend together in ombre. These DO however, need to be trimmed and styled to suit and compliment your natural hair. Otherwise, it&#x27;s going to look very fake and very tacky. Just a heads up! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these extensions to a novice diva. It&#x27;s going to take correct placement and styling for the right effect.</li>
            <li> I got the one that looks like a light and dark purple, but it is a dark flamingo pink and neon purple, completely different colors than the image!!! Very fake plastic looking, so unhappy with it. Don&#x27;t let any of the pictures fool you, it does not look like that, it looks like one of those fake anime wigs!</li>
            <li> It is insanely long,I thought  it&#x27;d fit my hair perfect, it&#x27;s a tad long but that&#x27;s good so I can layer it. The only bummer is,the rose red really isn&#x27;t red at all. I would call it a light magenta? So it doesn&#x27;t match my red hair at all,either way I love it and am gonna put some purple in it,so it will blend with the purple bottom. This is a great price, I would love to be able to order a custom color one though, so I could get my red/purple ones too. I would recommend this, for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong. Also, this came two weeks earlier than expected. I was suprised,and happy because I was hoping I could wear it two weeks from now!</li>
            <li> Very good quality hair. Ships much faster than I expected. Super nice salespeople. Glad to have bought a nice product. Much longer hair than I thought it would be. I just was silly and didn&#x27;t try to measure when I should have.</li>
            <li> I bought for my 11 yo. She loves it long hair &amp; stayed in her hair all day. Looks nice.</li>
            <li> This produce came in perfect condition and I wear them in my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the hair and great service too!</li>
            <li> its very shiny and doesnt blend well.</li>
            <li> Pretty colors but hard to pull off, especially if your hair is layered. Be prepared to trim it because the piece is very long.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing. the color I got was rose red to purple. its looks amazing. it was very long but all I did was cut it down to size. and I am no hairstylist but I still looks very good and even if its a little off it looks more natural like that. I highly recommend this product it isn&#x27;t shiny and it came in 2 weeks before it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> Love it! It&#x27;s soo full. Just tangles a bit too often.</li>
            <li> Looks better than the picture, arrived on time, and was better quality than I expected!</li>
            <li> It was delievered alot earlier than it was supposed to, it was in perfect condition, it was easy to brush, the color was perfect it&#x27;s thick, and the clips at the top were really secure. You do have to straighten or curl your hair to make it blend though, (but I straighten mine anyway). For the price I was paying I was expecting a cheap, thin hair extension but i&#x27;m really happy with it and I also have another but in a different color on the way.</li>
            <li> Exactly what i expected!!# very pleased! Just had to do some trimming!</li>
            <li> these are great! the color is very true to the picture. warning though, VERY thick. best for people with already thick hair.</li>
            <li> Two of the five clips broke after the second time wearing them. Otherwise, they were thick and true to colour.</li>
            <li> Looks very fake and hard to blend into hair types.</li>
            <li> took forever to arrive. upside is that the hair stayed good for about a month</li>
