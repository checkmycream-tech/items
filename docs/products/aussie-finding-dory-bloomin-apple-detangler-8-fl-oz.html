            <li>/&gt;Smells nice too!</li>
            <li>The fruity scent is quite pleasant, but not so over powering it seems out of place in a gentleman&#x27;s toilette.</li>
            <li>Works good to get the tangles out of her curly hair too.</li>
            <li>And it smells sooo good -</li>
            <li>we love the smell of this product and works great</li>
            <li>This product is awesome, it really works!</li>
            <li>even my husband commented how nice it smells.</li>
            <li>It smells good without being overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>Her hair tangles very easily</li>
            <li>it also smells delicious and it leaves your hair feeling soft and moisturized without that greasy feeling</li>
            <li>I always buy this, it smells wonderful and keeps her hair smelling good all day long!</li>
            <li>It rinses right off your hands and works great for me.</li>
            <li>This works better than the suave products in the store that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I love sniffing my daughters hair</li>
            <li>Product: this is more like a leave in conditioner</li>
            <li>By the way I love the scent.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m not so sure</li>
            <li>My daughter loves Dora, so (especially at first)</li>
            <li>my girls love to brush their hair themselves in the mornings and this spray enables them to ‘to it themselves ‘ and look fabulous - plus it smells great and is super economical</li>
            <li>This has worked great for my daughter&#x27;s naturally curly hair!  </li>
            <li>and now one single bottle is more than $10.00!!!  </li>
            <li>but it feels sticky in your hair and on your hands where most will feel smooth.</li>
            <li>It sprays well and makes it so easy to comb through her hair.</li>
            <li>Her fine hair still gets tangled.</li>
            <li>This is the only spray that works and it smells great.</li>
            <li>Not only does this detangler work great to get the kinks out of your hair</li>
            <li>we use Aussie shampoo and conditioner on her hair and finish it off with another Aussie product that has the same great smell.&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li>and she never makes a sound.</li>
            <li>The scent is better then most perfume samples I&#x27;ve gotten recently, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my daughter in a pinch, and overall I&#x27;m pretty happy.</li>
            <li>I like this product the best for my daughters thick, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>This spray is by far the best I have found to detangle and leave the hair smelling great without a weird residue!</li>
            <li>I was so happy to get this item 2 months ago as part of the subscribe and save program for under $3.00 and now it&#x27;s not available anymore through this program</li>
            <li>This is by far the favorite in the house.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a product that will work on my 4 year old daughters fine hair.</li>
            <li>: Works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>she is more likely to allow us to brush her hair when we tell her we will use this.  </li>
            <li>This makes brushing so much easier for my five year old who has fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I use it daily on my daughter and makes her hair smell beatifull and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>She loves the smell and it leaves her long, fine hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>However if you want a quick fix let&#x27;s say like when you need to style hair this is heavy, for that purpose I prefer something lighter,even more &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; like the suave detangling spray.  </li>
            <li>and she doesn&#x27;t complain much.  </li>
            <li>really helped.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to spray a lot in her hair in order to really get the brush through.</li>
            <li>It makes morning hair fixing so much easier.</li>
            <li>I wish it had more natural ingredients, which is why I only gave it four stars, but it does the job well, and she likes it.</li>
            <li>It softens my daughter&#x27;s hair making it a little more manageable.</li>
            <li>little grand daughter age 4 calls it &amp;#34;aussome&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t too strong so its not overwhelmingly sweet when I put it in my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic I have to use very little compared to what I was using and it works fast even if I don&#x27;t condition her hair before brushing.</li>
            <li>Use this sparingly on fine hair as it can make hair look a little greasy.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my little grand daughter instead of the usual supermarket brands and it works great on her thick hair.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t completely detangles but helps with the process.</li>
            <li>Problem is that I can&#x27;t find it in any store near by me.  </li>
            <li>My 4yr old daughter loves the smell.</li>
            <li>Scent is ok.....not a natural scent.  </li>
            <li>Mine definitely didn&#x27;t smell much like apples.  </li>
            <li>This detangles a little bit, but not so great for long, thick, curly hair.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have very long hair</li>

            <li> My hair is pretty thick and even using conditioner, it&#x27;s still hard to brush out</li>
            <li> and I damage it a lot trying to brush out the knots when it is wet, but using this stuff has made that a non-issue!</li>
            <li> I have gotten with other detangling spray.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used it on dry hair too (just spritz a little and brush through).  </li>

            <li> My daughters hair is always a tangled mess when ever she wakes up. This product is perfect for her. It detangles well plus it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and ended up switching from my pricey salon leave-in to this! My hair is pretty thick and even using conditioner, it&#x27;s still hard to brush out and I damage it a lot trying to brush out the knots when it is wet, but using this stuff has made that a non-issue!</li>
            <li> my girls love to brush their hair themselves in the mornings and this spray enables them to ‘to it themselves ‘ and look fabulous - plus it smells great and is super economical</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery. Smells great. Works well on curly hairs. It softens my daughter&#x27;s hair making it a little more manageable. Doesn&#x27;t completely detangles but helps with the process.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome, it really works! I bought it for my daughter and I truly recommend it! And it smells good!</li>
            <li> This works better than the suave products in the store that I&#x27;ve used. Use it on my six-year old, who has long, thick hair. This is the only spray that works and it smells great.</li>
            <li> I always buy this, it smells wonderful and keeps her hair smelling good all day long! I love sniffing my daughters hair lol. Works good to get the tangles out of her curly hair too.</li>

            <li> I bought this to use on my daughter&#x27;s hair. It sprays well and makes it so easy to comb through her hair. She loves that Dora and Diego are on the bottle. And it smells sooo good - even my husband commented how nice it smells. Great product.</li>
            <li> This is by far the favorite in the house. I use it daily on my daughter and makes her hair smell beatifull and easy to manage. My daughter loves it</li>
            <li> we love the smell of this product and works great</li>

            <li> I have been searching for a product that will work on my 4 year old daughters fine hair. Her hair tangles very easily and I usually have to dump a ton of conditioner on it and then use a detangler and even then she still had a hard time sitting still while I brushed her hair. But not anymore! This product is fantastic I have to use very little compared to what I was using and it works fast even if I don&#x27;t condition her hair before brushing. Great product!</li>
            <li> This makes brushing so much easier for my five year old who has fine hair.  We&#x27;ve used it on dry hair too (just spritz a little and brush through).  It smells good without being overwhelming.  I wish it had more natural ingredients, which is why I only gave it four stars, but it does the job well, and she likes it.</li>
            <li> Product: this is more like a leave in conditioner that&#x27;s how I describe it.  I use it when I comb my daughter&#x27;s hair after her bath.  She has curly hair (just curly at the ends) and she doesn&#x27;t complain much.  However if you want a quick fix let&#x27;s say like when you need to style hair this is heavy, for that purpose I prefer something lighter,even more &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; like the suave detangling spray.  I was so happy to get this item 2 months ago as part of the subscribe and save program for under $3.00 and now it&#x27;s not available anymore through this program and now one single bottle is more than $10.00!!!  Problem is that I can&#x27;t find it in any store near by me.  By the way I love the scent.  It stays on my daughter&#x27;s hair even the next day.  Please subscribe and save bring it back!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my little grand daughter instead of the usual supermarket brands and it works great on her thick hair.  we use Aussie shampoo and conditioner on her hair and finish it off with another Aussie product that has the same great smell.&lt;br /&gt;my little grand daughter age 4 calls it &amp;#34;aussome&amp;#34;  and of course amazon service, price and shipping can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my daughter in a pinch, and overall I&#x27;m pretty happy. Use this sparingly on fine hair as it can make hair look a little greasy.</li>
            <li> My 4yr old daughter loves the smell. But I&#x27;m not so sure how well it&#x27;s working as detangler. Her fine hair still gets tangled.</li>
            <li> Pros: Works pretty well.  My daughter loves Dora, so (especially at first) she is more likely to allow us to brush her hair when we tell her we will use this.  She has long hair without bangs that is always getting in her face and she hates for us to fix it, so having Dora on the front really helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Eventually the fact that Dora is on the front doesn&#x27;t matter and she&#x27;s against us brushing her hair again.  It has a semi-unpleasant smell that sort of smells like sticky-sweet mixed artificial fruit.  It makes her hair feel a little tacky.  I have to spray a lot in her hair in order to really get the brush through.</li>
            <li> As always, the Aussie products don&#x27;t disappoint. This has worked great for my daughter&#x27;s naturally curly hair!  It makes morning hair fixing so much easier.</li>
            <li> This has made brushing my daughter&#x27;s hair a dream.  She loves the smell and it leaves her long, fine hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I just got this at the store, and wanted to post a review. I got it for myself, even though it says for kids. I have very long hair and it&#x27;s thick. I made the mistake of getting some layers in my hair and it tangles now. This Aussie spray is great, works great for tangles, and just like everyone posted......the apple smell is amazing! The scent is better then most perfume samples I&#x27;ve gotten recently, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a lifesaver, my husband and I both have long hair his is bleached blonde (and as we all know bleached hair loves to get TANGLED) and mine is all the way to my rear end, this helps husband avoid nightmare tangles and breakage and me avoid tears trying to remove tangles.  The fruity scent is quite pleasant, but not so over powering it seems out of place in a gentleman&#x27;s toilette.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm on my daughter&#x27;s thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes combing it much easier and less painful.  Also helps bring back her curls after a night&#x27;s sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells nice too!</li>
            <li> This detangles a little bit, but not so great for long, thick, curly hair.  Scent is ok.....not a natural scent.  Mine definitely didn&#x27;t smell much like apples.  I will go back to purchasing the pineapple detangler.</li>
            <li> Perfect for kids. The smell isn&#x27;t too strong so its not overwhelmingly sweet when I put it in my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my niece because she has long hair.  Whenever she spends the night she loves to take a shower at my house, but she would always cry when I brushed her hair.  Now I use the detangler and she never makes a sound.</li>
