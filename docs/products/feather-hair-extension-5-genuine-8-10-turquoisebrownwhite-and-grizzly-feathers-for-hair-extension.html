            <li>These feathers look great in my hair, but the turquoise definitely fades.</li>
            <li>You can wash them no problem, and everyone asks me where I get them and say they look so cool.</li>

            <li>They are very durable if you take good care of them, and you can do anything you want: curl it, straight, anything really.</li>
            <li>The color washed out within two weeks, so what was once teal in now right, but that&#x27;s alright,</li>
            <li>I still have it and they gave me an extra piece to put it back in my hair which is great</li>
            <li>I love these feathers especially the turquoise color combination.</li>
            <li>Was exactly as described ( One piece with five feathers on it).  </li>
            <li>it will tell you exactly what it is.  </li>
            <li>Will be ordering more in the future</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>

            <li>The feathers are MUCH shorter than advertized...</li>
            <li>Fell out fast, color faded.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But only the price is cheap.</li>
            <li>their very cute&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>this product was not true to color at all but the feathers are super pretty!</li>

            <li> My 5 year old</li>
            <li> The picture is completely misleading.</li>
            <li> I like the feathers from this company and have had them in a long time now, one finally faded after weeks of washing my hair</li>
            <li> They always come to my house earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> So when I would clamp down on the bead I would miss all the feathers, and when I would try to open the bead again it broke.</li>
            <li> (And they only fade a little).</li>
            <li> If removed carefully, they can reapplied at another time.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> had other feathers before and these are not very good quality, and I only got a few of them.</li>
            <li> Unless you have short, thin hair</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for hair feathers in these color tones, then look no more and order these feathers.</li>
            <li> It is so thin you can&#x27;t even see it in my thick, long hair.</li>
            <li> came broken and torn apart, couldn&#x27;t tell if it was suppose to be 1 extension or 5 it was so badly torn up... complete waste of money!!!!</li>
            <li> but I was extremely disappointed when I received them and only had 1 piece.</li>
            <li> but i was only one set with 5 feather in it. :(</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t realize how thin.</li>
            <li> The product is 5 thin feathers that are all attached together.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically one thin hair piece.  </li>
            <li> False advertising...</li>
            <li> picture shows lots of feathers and shows up with a few in it nothing like the picture its bad advertising</li>
            <li> Really sad...</li>
            <li> I am disappointed</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> So disappointed in this feather.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love love love these!</li>
            <li> These are beautiful, but the picture is deceiving. There are only five feathers in this pack.</li>
            <li> The feathers are MUCH shorter than advertized... Only 3.5 inches. I am disappointed</li>
            <li> I love the feathers but for the price I wish you could get more for your money .</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors and variety. It was cheaper to purchase these than it was to bring my daughter to the hairdresser for one. They are very easy to attach and remove. If removed carefully, they can reapplied at another time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with my buy. I love these feathers especially the turquoise color combination. The shipping time was as described, and they came in their own packaging. The quality of the feathers is great. They&#x27;re salon quality. I&#x27;ve already got tons of compliments from friends and people I don&#x27;t even know, but still stop me to ask where did I get them. If you&#x27;re looking for hair feathers in these color tones, then look no more and order these feathers. You won&#x27;t regret it. For the price, and quality of the product that you&#x27;re getting, it truly is a great DEAL! I&#x27;ll be getting more for sure, to fill my hair with these wonderful feathers.</li>
            <li> Extremely happy with the purchase.  Was exactly as described ( One piece with five feathers on it).  Read the description before you order it will tell you exactly what it is.  My 5 year old and I both love them.  Will be ordering more in the future</li>
            <li> came broken and torn apart, couldn&#x27;t tell if it was suppose to be 1 extension or 5 it was so badly torn up... complete waste of money!!!!</li>
            <li> Thought it would be five different plugs. But its just five feathers on one plug.</li>
            <li> Great quality feather</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase from this seller. Beautiful feather! They add cute style and are easy to attach to your hair. I need more!</li>
            <li> I was expecting the feathers to be longer and fuller. The picture of this product should have been the actual packaged product so you arent misled. However the feathers are beautiful.</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking there would be 5 individual feathers because I wanted multiple in my hair. When it came in the mail it&#x27;s was all 5 attached together as one. I was so disappointed. It&#x27;s only comes with 2 beads and they break really easily. When I was trying to insert the feather in between the bead and my hair, the plastic piece at the top began come apart and feathers started falling out. So when I would clamp down on the bead I would miss all the feathers, and when I would try to open the bead again it broke. I broke both of them and in the end I had to wrap tape around the top of my feathers to hold the plastic together and then I had to use and elastic to hold it to my hair. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product ever again. But I guess that is what you get when you want to buy something that cheap.</li>
            <li> Beautifil, my daughter loved it!</li>
            <li> picture shows lots of feathers and shows up with a few in it nothing like the picture its bad advertising</li>
            <li> sexy sparkles is a great quality hair feather to choose, they really do make a quality product and i will continue buying them. very pretty colors, true to picture :) i wear these continuously and straiten and blow dry my hair without any noticeable damage</li>
            <li> So disappointed in this feather. The picture is completely misleading. I read some of the reviews before I bought it, so I knew it was going to be smaller but I didn&#x27;t realize how thin. It is so thin you can&#x27;t even see it in my thick, long hair. This feather is truly a joke. Unless you have short, thin hair it&#x27;s pretty much useless. Really sad...</li>
            <li> daughter ordered them and have had them in for a month now.  She loves them.  Can curl, wash, braid.  Seem to stay in great</li>
            <li> granddaughter loved them</li>
            <li> These came and they look great HOWEVER, please note that this photo is EXTREMELY DECEIVING.  The product is 5 thin feathers that are all attached together. It&#x27;s basically one thin hair piece.  The photo makes it look like you will be getting a set of 5 or a lot of feathers but that is not the case.  I think they look great but I was extremely disappointed when I received them and only had 1 piece.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rewriting my review because after writing my last one, my feathers finally came in! Thank you so much! I love them!!!</li>
            <li> Fell out fast, color faded.&lt;br /&gt;I had other feathers before and these are not very good quality, and I only got a few of them.</li>
            <li> I love this seller. I have yet to find cheaper genuine grizzly feathers anywhere else. But only the price is cheap. The quality is excellent; the colors are vivid and the length is accurately listed. They always come to my house earlier than expected. I wear them for months before the colors start to fade. (And they only fade a little). They&#x27;re a great conversation starter and look great in my hair!</li>
            <li> Okay, I LOVED my feather. I got it for prom. it was inexpensive. I just used some pliers to put it in and it stayed for 3 MONTHS!!! it was awesome they usually don&#x27;t stay that long. I actually had to take it out my self. I still have it and they gave me an extra piece to put it back in my hair which is great&lt;br /&gt;1 tiny problem though. The color washed out within two weeks, so what was once teal in now right, but that&#x27;s alright, I still love it and so does everyone else!!</li>
            <li> I like the feathers from this company and have had them in a long time now, one finally faded after weeks of washing my hair and I think that&#x27;s pretty good.  Very pretty.</li>
            <li> This feathers are so cute! They are very durable if you take good care of them, and you can do anything you want: curl it, straight, anything really. They don&#x27;t burn or anything. You can wash them no problem, and everyone asks me where I get them and say they look so cool. Really nice and cheap!</li>
            <li> this product was not true to color at all but the feathers are super pretty! so go go ahead. buy it! i put these feathers in as soon as i got them!</li>
            <li> Really long lasting and easy to use.  It lasted for months!!</li>
            <li> Their Easy to use and my sister loves them their very cute&lt;br /&gt;And adorable for any age:) so Five star from me</li>
            <li> These feathers look great in my hair, but the turquoise definitely fades. They still look good, though, and withstand my curling iron every day.</li>
            <li> I though i was got to be 5 extensions but i was only one set with 5 feather in it. :( False advertising...</li>
