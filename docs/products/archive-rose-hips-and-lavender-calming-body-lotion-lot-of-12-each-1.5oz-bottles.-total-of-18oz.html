            <li>The fragrance is very light</li>

            <li>I love the fragrance and use it before bed.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion!!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I really love the fragrance, it&#x27;s not as moisturizing as i would like</li>
            <li>This is possibly the best smelling lotion I have ever used!</li>
            <li>Ever since I stayed at the Eliot Hotel in Boston, I wanted to have this lovely fragrance by Archive.</li>
            <li>but I love the lotion</li>
            <li>Wish it came in larger sized bottles, but these are perfect for travel and for my purse.</li>
            <li>just OK</li>
            <li>, I was using it more like a daytime perfume.  </li>
            <li>Lovely scent and not sticky.  </li>
            <li>But, it is soothing and relaxing scent and glad I found it.</li>
            <li>It has a light rose fragrance that isn&#x27;t over powering.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion very nice and rich and does not bother sensitive skin</li>
            <li>After staying at a hotel in Kansas City when I first experienced it, I was immediately drawn to the scent, which is unusual for me.</li>
            <li>Soft, pleasant smell of roses.</li>
            <li>but I honestly believed it was a large bottle of this scented lotion.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s unusual rose &amp; lavender scent.  </li>
            <li>To me, they smelled like a mans cheap aftershave.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is light and non greasy</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s the perfect combination of floral scent without being overpowering &amp; a lotion that&#x27;s not sticky or slick.</li>
            <li>it is s light, sweet smell.</li>
            <li>This is a nice product, I went on vacation last year and the hotel that I stayed in has this product, I loved this scent, small bottle that is good for my work in my purses.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I tracked it down on the internet and found it for sale at good old Amazon.com!!!!</li>
            <li>Apparently, it&#x27;s not a retail product, so I was delighted to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>it was gaping on both ends, but luckily the bottles were contained in a zip lock bag.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.  </li>
            <li>Good to use as a product to support dry skin relief.  </li>
            <li>Great to carry everyday in my purse.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this lotion; wish it was available in a larger size!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a delicious product...wish it cane in something other than tiny 2 oz.</li>
            <li>Such a lovely, clean fragrance</li>
            <li>Great product I wish it wasn&#x27;t in small bottles</li>
            <li>but since I didn&#x27;t open the package I can&#x27;t be sure.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not going to be super moisturizing as a main lotion</li>
            <li>love this product Wish it was sold in larger bottles</li>
            <li>It made my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>As for the small sized-bottles -- I&#x27;ve actually found them ideal.</li>
            <li>When I went home I bought a whole bunch of the travel bottles online.</li>
            <li>Smells fresh for several hours.  </li>
            <li>I first found this product at a motel and wished later that I had snagged a few more before leaving.  </li>
            <li>This is the only place that I could find it, because it got it the first time in a hotel.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is only available at hotels and so this small size is the only one available.  </li>
            <li>I really wish they were sold in larger bottles, but beggars can&#x27;t be choosers!</li>
            <li>I suggest you buy it whenever Amazon offers it.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t say for sure because it did show up as 12 small bottles in my final order</li>
            <li>I recently discovered this body lotion at Hotel Mazarin in New Orleans.</li>
            <li>but I just expected more than a few tiny bottles of this for $25.  </li>
            <li>I am not a perfume-wearer, but this particular combination of smells resonated with me as none other had.</li>

            <li> I can use the small bottles but at $2 a pop</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have 12 small bottles (sample size) around.  </li>
            <li> it lingers with the delicate scent of roses and lavender.  </li>
            <li> product is very hard to find.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to find, so</li>
            <li> The place that sent the bottles to me did a poor job of packaging - the box was so poorly taped</li>
            <li> Kinda expensive</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This lotion is so good smelling, I would eat it if it were edible.</li>
            <li> I sought out this product for over 5 years, unsuccessfully, until now. After staying at a hotel in Kansas City when I first experienced it, I was immediately drawn to the scent, which is unusual for me. I am not a perfume-wearer, but this particular combination of smells resonated with me as none other had. For me, it&#x27;s the perfect combination of floral scent without being overpowering &amp; a lotion that&#x27;s not sticky or slick. As for the small sized-bottles -- I&#x27;ve actually found them ideal. I have one at home, in my purse, and at work (and more waiting to replace them). I can reapply whenever I need.</li>
            <li> This has a great fragrance and is not oily.  Just the perfect cream to moisturize with a light a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion; wish it was available in a larger size!</li>
            <li> Great product I wish it wasn&#x27;t in small bottles</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a delicious product...wish it cane in something other than tiny 2 oz. bottles!</li>
            <li> So soothing...glad I found them on amazon !</li>
            <li> I first found this product at a motel and wished later that I had snagged a few more before leaving.  I love the fragrance and use it before bed.  The place that sent the bottles to me did a poor job of packaging - the box was so poorly taped it was gaping on both ends, but luckily the bottles were contained in a zip lock bag.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!!&lt;br /&gt;This product is very hard to find.  I purchased in bulk so I wouldn&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion very nice and rich and does not bother sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I really love the fragrance, it&#x27;s not as moisturizing as i would like but i just mix it with my best moisturizer and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> This is possibly the best smelling lotion I have ever used! I really wish they were sold in larger bottles, but beggars can&#x27;t be choosers! I received the lotion on time, and am extremely satisfied with it!</li>
            <li> LOVE this!  period.  It is not greasy and it smells so nice:) This is the only place that I could find it, because it got it the first time in a hotel.  It is truly wonderful.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s not being mass produced and sold in stores. It&#x27;s silky on my skin, it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feel. The lavender and rose hips scent is very mild, not overpowering. I have very dry, cracked skin and when I put this lotion on it doesn&#x27;t burn and itch like some of the other brands that I have tried in the past. In my opinion this is the best lotion that money can buy!</li>
            <li> Soft, pleasant smell of roses.</li>
            <li> This lotion is only available at hotels and so this small size is the only one available.  I had to buy the 12 pack because of it&#x27;s unusual rose &amp; lavender scent.  It is gorgeous.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.  Happy with product.  Good to use as a product to support dry skin relief.  Product was found in a hotel resort accommodation.  Like product and ordered for home use.  Very good product.</li>
            <li> Ever since I stayed at the Eliot Hotel in Boston, I wanted to have this lovely fragrance by Archive. Apparently, it&#x27;s not a retail product, so I was delighted to find it on Amazon.  It&#x27;s pricey but I am happy I ordered it.</li>
            <li> Kinda expensive but I love the lotion, I found it at  a motel in the middle of Oklahoma and could never find it to buy. In small bottles it is kind expensive and a pain but I still wanted it cause it makes me happy to smell the smell.!</li>
            <li> I came across the while staying at Water&#x27;s Edge Resort in CT.  Such a lovely, clean fragrance and I had to find it for home.  Wish it came in larger sized bottles, but these are perfect for travel and for my purse. Beautiful fragrance!</li>
            <li> This item appeared to be a much larger bottle and I can&#x27;t say for sure because it did show up as 12 small bottles in my final order but I honestly believed it was a large bottle of this scented lotion.  I can use the small bottles but at $2 a pop I think it&#x27;s just a rip off.  The smell is wonderful but I just expected more than a few tiny bottles of this for $25.  I don&#x27;t even thing I received all 12 but since I didn&#x27;t open the package I can&#x27;t be sure.  But even 12 bottles, I would not pay $2 for one of these little bottles at a retail store and they have overhead.  Anyway yes the scent is very nice and lotion effective just OK it&#x27;s not going to be super moisturizing as a main lotion, I was using it more like a daytime perfume.  So nice scent but the price STINKS!!!</li>
            <li> Smells awesome, and is nice and rich.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product, I went on vacation last year and the hotel that I stayed in has this product, I loved this scent, small bottle that is good for my work in my purses.</li>
            <li> Heard how good this was.  Had to order 12 bottles.  To me, they smelled like a mans cheap aftershave.  Took them to work and let people take them.</li>
            <li> I recently discovered this body lotion at Hotel Mazarin in New Orleans. It has a wonderful fragrance and feels great on the skin.  It&#x27;s very hard to find, so I suggest you buy it whenever Amazon offers it. The 1.5 ounce bottle makes it perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> Smells so good I just love this lotion !!!  Wish they made it in a big bottle !!</li>
            <li> I had these in a hotel stay and searched to find it.  Lovely scent and not sticky.  Smells fresh for several hours.  Wish I could find it in larger size so I don&#x27;t have 12 small bottles (sample size) around.  But, it is soothing and relaxing scent and glad I found it.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product at the Two Bunch Palms Spa in Palm Springs, CA! I loved it so much I tracked it down on the internet and found it for sale at good old Amazon.com!!!!</li>
            <li> love this product Wish it was sold in larger bottles</li>
            <li> this is expensive but really works on my dry skin!  and I love the wonderful rose smell!</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very light but I get great compliments on it.  Fragrance is not overpowering and hydration is good.  Great to carry everyday in my purse.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great lotion and smells so good.</li>
            <li> The lotion is light and non greasy it lingers with the delicate scent of roses and lavender.  I just wish they made it in larger containers.  This is definitely going to be part of my moisturizing regimen.</li>

            <li> I was at a hotel that carried this lotion as part of their toiletries.  It made my skin feel soft and smooth. It has a light rose fragrance that isn&#x27;t over powering. When I went home I bought a whole bunch of the travel bottles online.</li>
