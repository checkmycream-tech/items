            <li>He liked the idea of it being a men&#x27;s soap and not a &amp;</li>
            <li>Odor very strong.</li>
            <li>They do not leave an over-perfumey scent but give you a great, an pretty manly smell for the situations in which women are in close contact</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good to know there is a good high end soap for men...</li>
            <li>and I love them.  </li>
            <li>but that is now my favorite.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>3 stars means it is okay, and I am keeping that rating for now.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how I justify the price anyway:)</li>
            <li>I love how these soap bars smell.</li>
            <li>you always want to give folks that visit WITHOUT having the guys looking at you and smirking going &#x27;awww, isn&#x27;t that nice?  </li>
            <li>Most of all my wife likes it.  </li>
            <li>The recipients love the fragrances.  </li>
            <li>each will end up with their favorite.</li>
            <li>:) Give it a try, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li>I love all four bars of this brand, great smell and easily delivered thanks to amazon....</li>
            <li>Have I mentioned that my first bar was good for 9 months?  </li>
            <li>Nice earthy scents - none of that kissy sweet stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love taking showers, sometimes 2X a day specially with a luxury soaps like these.</li>
            <li>cause I have eczema) and smell fantastic.</li>
            <li>These smell great , and last forever.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as powerful as the cedarwood marine, but still okay.</li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying all of these soaps smell fantastic.  </li>
            <li>You only live once to try the VERY BEST of everything</li>
            <li>The scent of each soap is unique and leaves the scent on your skin.  </li>
            <li>Something else I didn&#x27;t consider before of the benefit of these soap bars over liquid soap is that they act as a nice all natural air freshener.</li>
            <li>so why not try and buy the very best that your hard earned money can afford!?</li>
            <li>Hew really likes it and the bars seem to last a good while.</li>
            <li>My bathroom had a nice scent since I left the bar of soap out.</li>
            <li>So far I am pleased.</li>
            <li>Sooo worth it.   </li>
            <li>Big man size bars that lather up nicely.  </li>
            <li>The box is heavy from the soap bars, and the design is very nice.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really changed my original opinion on cedarwood marine.</li>
            <li>They last super long, don&#x27;t get soggy or degraded, they feel great on my skin (and that&#x27;s saying something</li>
            <li>The Sandalwood &amp; Black Amber seem to be the two most prominent but overall all of them are always truly enjoyed.</li>
            <li>but I just don&#x27;t see the great value in spending $10 to use the same bar of soap for a month, when I can spend $7 for liquid body wash for two months (and not rubbing the same thing on me for that time period).</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a gift for a guy that is hard to buy for, this is a great idea.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They were so enjoyable that I bought them as a Xmas present for someone else.</li>
            <li>Great scent and last a long time.</li>
            <li>Brandon uses &amp;#34;notreallymanly soap.&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li>These are the soaps MADE FOR THE GODS because it&#x27;s luxurious, very pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>but you will definitely find a favorite (Marin is mine).&lt;br</li>
            <li>These soaps so the job and more when it comes to impressing a significant other at all times.</li>
            <li>Really good soap, a little more expensive but smells good.</li>
            <li>No harsh girly perfumes, you smell like a clean man after using this product.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s also produced from mostly vegetable ingredients makes it a big plus as well --- but gets the shower and face washing job done very well, with a manly all day after-shower scent.</li>
            <li>Other than that issue, the soaps smell nice and are quite large.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I barely get clean with that.  </li>
            <li>It was appreciated when opened but have not heard anything about how it was to use.</li>
            <li>, this is much better than my old stand by with the Irish swirls...  </li>
            <li>It is a nice scent, but doesn&#x27;t last particularly long.</li>
            <li>As far as scent, while the soap bar itself has a strong scent if left uncovered, I didn&#x27;t feel like it left such a strong skin on my body.</li>
            <li>Before I go any further, let me state that I just finished my first bar two days ago; it lasted 9 MONTHS!  </li>
            <li>The bars are big, so they are worth the money.</li>
            <li>You open it up and the four bars are sitting there nice and tightly packed.</li>
            <li>I would definitely suggest the gift set as the first purchase.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They are huge bars of soap that will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li>Overall I still feel it is an adequate product, especially if you already use bar soap.</li>
            <li>I guess the old lady think so too.</li>
            <li>The feeling wears off a few minutes after getting out of the shower, but it definitely had me wondering if liquid soap is better for your skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smelling good is something men should strive for but wearing cologne can be overpowering and is expensive to try to use every day.  </li>
            <li>All smell very masculine and these bars last forever.</li>
            <li>It smelled somewhat nice, but very weak.</li>
            <li>Wow, who knew that bar soap could actually be so comforting?!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I could barely smell it on myself.</li>
            <li>SOme of the stuff my wife tries to get me to use have way too much of a &#x27;softness&#x27; to them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m finding some really good products that guys shouldn&#x27;t be afraid to try out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Needless to say ALL of them really liked this and</li>
            <li>I have sensentive skin, this product so far has proven to be mild enough to thorougly cleanse me without drying my hide excessively.</li>
            <li>How many bottles of ridiculous smelling Axe (or similar) would you low though in 9 months?  </li>
            <li>Please be aware the picture is not exactly what is currently shipping now.  </li>
            <li>as far as bar soaps go, its got a decent scent, but its not worth the cost to me.</li>
            <li>No more dry skin, great (and subtle) scent, and</li>
            <li>High quality, long lasting bars of soap with manly fragrances that are just to die for!  </li>
            <li>far, I have only use the blue cedarwood marine soap.</li>
            <li>Perhaps this is just how all bar soap feels in general, but I felt like it left my skin immediately drier (or perhaps stickier?)</li>
            <li>They last a long time and it was a refreshing change from other mens soaps that I usually get at Walmart.</li>

            <li> Overall, nicer than some other bar soaps, but stick to liquid soap if you already use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1: The cedarwood marine soap lasted about a month, not using it every day.</li>
            <li> The bar itself looks simple and the smell is kind of weird, but once your in the shower the aroma is eye opening, it kick starts all your senses to the point that you hate stepping out of the shower and when you do step out of the shower that clean smell stays for awhile.</li>
            <li> this is supposed to be a product with utility, not aesthetic design, so that goes only a little bit into the review.</li>
            <li> So essentially, you are paying a little over $10 for each bar of soap.</li>
            <li> I will update the review as I try the others, but Ihave a feeling little will change except the scent being slightly different, they all had a woodsy smell in the box.</li>
            <li> I was just curious about this.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a milled soap meaning they spent a lot of time care research &amp; effort making these</li>
            <li> Not much to say here...</li>
            <li> I personally think that whoever made these soaps must have put a bottle of very expensive men&#x27;s cologne, the type of perfume that you only get from Macy&#x27;s and Neiman Marcus because the scent stays with you almost the whole day.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a BIG BAR of soap and this soap does NOT fit in your average sized soap container.</li>
            <li> Between getting older and living in Colorado, my skin was drying out and itching like crazy, so I looked around for something that wouldn&#x27;t dry my skin out further.  </li>
            <li> In my quest to find something other than what my wife buys me for shower/facial, etc.</li>
            <li> Usually I don&#x27;t promise myself to buy the same soap again</li>
            <li> I thought I wouldn&#x27;t like the black amber</li>
            <li> just tried the Amber Boire (the black one)</li>
            <li> They are a little pricey</li>
            <li> The last Mistral soap bar I bought before buying these 4 bars lasted me 5 MONTHS of everyday showers!!!</li>
            <li> It shows a green bar labeled Citrus Woods, but mine did not ship with that, instead in its place is Teak Wood.  </li>
            <li> The box has bubbled wrapped around it and the soaps inside are neatly and firmly nestled.</li>
            <li> Within a few hours, the scent had faded.</li>
            <li> Tired of smelling like a teenage boy?  </li>
            <li> but if you are willing to spend the money you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I know this soap is expensive, but treat yourself once in awhile we only will once and spending $42 dollars on soap won&#x27;t kill you.</li>
            <li> Crazy expensive, and entirely worth it.  </li>
            <li> My husband is often hard to buy gifts for because he is picky, but he loves these soaps.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat any of the aroma&#x27;s, and each bar is 250 grams, so one bar of soap usually lasts 4-5 weeks!  </li>
            <li> Expensive isn&#x27;t it?  </li>
            <li> I bit the rather expensive bullet and bought this to try it out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s $10.50 a bar of soap, it&#x27;s extremely expensive no doubt..but the fragrance of these soaps!?</li>
            <li> You will not be sorry!</li>
            <li> Try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed, I can&#x27;t wait to try the others too</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> it smells gud! I guess the old lady think so too.</li>
            <li> High quality, long lasting bars of soap with manly fragrances that are just to die for!  My husband loves them and they smell great on him.</li>
            <li> Wow, who knew that bar soap could actually be so comforting?!&lt;br /&gt;They are huge bars of soap that will last a very long time.  The scent of each soap is unique and leaves the scent on your skin.  Sandalwood is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were so enjoyable that I bought them as a Xmas present for someone else.</li>
            <li> Arrived as advertised; great transaction</li>
            <li> My son will only use this brand of soap.  It smells great!</li>
            <li> Purchased as gift for hubby and he loves the smell of these soaps. Came in nice gift box too. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Bought these and spread them around the house and I love them.  I have one in my kitchen, one in my bathroom and one in my shower.  I thought I wouldn&#x27;t like the black amber but that is now my favorite. They last super long, don&#x27;t get soggy or degraded, they feel great on my skin (and that&#x27;s saying something cause I have eczema) and smell fantastic. They are a little pricey but if you are willing to spend the money you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> These smell great , and last forever.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Love these. Great scent and last a long time.</li>
            <li> Very nice set of soap bars</li>
            <li> Please be aware the picture is not exactly what is currently shipping now.  It shows a green bar labeled Citrus Woods, but mine did not ship with that, instead in its place is Teak Wood.  Other than that issue, the soaps smell nice and are quite large.  The box has bubbled wrapped around it and the soaps inside are neatly and firmly nestled.</li>
            <li> This is the 3 or 4th time I purchased this soap for my fiancé. Hew really likes it and the bars seem to last a good while. The scent is manly and one of a kind..would recommend</li>
            <li> I need to preface my review by saying that I have been using liquid soap since I was a kid. Every couple of years I get a bar soap and then go back to using liquid soap. Therefore, those that specifically prefer bar soap over liquid may disagree with my views.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the packaging. This is the best part of the \\&quot;package,\\&quot; so to speak. The box is heavy from the soap bars, and the design is very nice. You open it up and the four bars are sitting there nice and tightly packed. For presentation I would give 5/5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is supposed to be a product with utility, not aesthetic design, so that goes only a little bit into the review. So essentially, you are paying a little over $10 for each bar of soap. I will describe my experience with the soap now, one by one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I have only use the blue cedarwood marine soap. Perhaps this is just how all bar soap feels in general, but I felt like it left my skin immediately drier (or perhaps stickier?) than when I use liquid body wash. The feeling wears off a few minutes after getting out of the shower, but it definitely had me wondering if liquid soap is better for your skin. As far as scent, while the soap bar itself has a strong scent if left uncovered, I didn&#x27;t feel like it left such a strong skin on my body. It smelled somewhat nice, but very weak. I could barely smell it on myself. Within a few hours, the scent had faded. Now, it is possible I just can&#x27;t pick up the smell of my own skin as well as someone else might, but I just don&#x27;t see the great value in spending $10 to use the same bar of soap for a month, when I can spend $7 for liquid body wash for two months (and not rubbing the same thing on me for that time period). Some of the liquid soaps even have stronger scents now that stay on you for a lot longer than this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its nice presentation, and as far as bar soaps go, its got a decent scent, but its not worth the cost to me. I will update the review as I try the others, but Ihave a feeling little will change except the scent being slightly different, they all had a woodsy smell in the box. Overall, nicer than some other bar soaps, but stick to liquid soap if you already use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1: The cedarwood marine soap lasted about a month, not using it every day. Something else I didn&#x27;t consider before of the benefit of these soap bars over liquid soap is that they act as a nice all natural air freshener. My bathroom had a nice scent since I left the bar of soap out. I haven&#x27;t really changed my original opinion on cedarwood marine. It is a nice scent, but doesn&#x27;t last particularly long. I have begun using the sandlewood bamboo scent now. It isn&#x27;t as powerful as the cedarwood marine, but still okay. It doesn&#x27;t have quite as good of an air freshener benefit. Overall I still feel it is an adequate product, especially if you already use bar soap. 3 stars means it is okay, and I am keeping that rating for now.</li>
            <li> Expensive isn&#x27;t it?  This is the best soap I&#x27;ve ever bought.  Can&#x27;t beat any of the aroma&#x27;s, and each bar is 250 grams, so one bar of soap usually lasts 4-5 weeks!  That&#x27;s how I justify the price anyway:)</li>
            <li> I purchased the set of 4, but I&#x27;ve only used 1 bar of soap, so my review will be based on that. The one I&#x27;m using is the light tan soap I can&#x27;t recall the name, but it smells beautiful. The bar itself looks simple and the smell is kind of weird, but once your in the shower the aroma is eye opening, it kick starts all your senses to the point that you hate stepping out of the shower and when you do step out of the shower that clean smell stays for awhile. I know this soap is expensive, but treat yourself once in awhile we only will once and spending $42 dollars on soap won&#x27;t kill you. Try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed, I can&#x27;t wait to try the others too</li>
            <li> Bought them as a gift. They love them and great quality. Smell awesome.</li>
            <li> I love how these soap bars smell. The lather is also great. These are always a treat to use.</li>
            <li> My husband loved your soap...it&#x27;s good to know there is a good high end soap for men...just wonderful!!!</li>
            <li> Crazy expensive, and entirely worth it.  Before I go any further, let me state that I just finished my first bar two days ago; it lasted 9 MONTHS!  It smells great, but not overpowering like so many gels and soaps.  Tired of smelling like a teenage boy?  This will do the job quite well, and 1 bar lasts virtually forever.  Between getting older and living in Colorado, my skin was drying out and itching like crazy, so I looked around for something that wouldn&#x27;t dry my skin out further.  I bit the rather expensive bullet and bought this to try it out.  It has done the job admirably.  No more dry skin, great (and subtle) scent, and it&#x27;s unbeleivable how long each bar lasts.  Have I mentioned that my first bar was good for 9 months?  How many bottles of ridiculous smelling Axe (or similar) would you low though in 9 months?  At $7/bottle, you will go through enough in 9 months to pay for these 4 bars, except that the 3 remaining bars of this soap will last you another 2+ years.  Plus, you won&#x27;t smell like a teenage boy who just discovered his dad&#x27;s aftershave.  **Update, June 13th, 2015** I just started my 3rd bar, which means my both of my 1st 2 bars each lasted 9 months.  This stuff rocks!</li>
            <li> All of these smell great, they are a light smell. The bars are big, so they are worth the money.</li>
            <li> In my quest to find something other than what my wife buys me for shower/facial, etc. I&#x27;m finding some really good products that guys shouldn&#x27;t be afraid to try out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just tried the Amber Boire (the black one) and I have to say, this is much better than my old stand by with the Irish swirls...  it has a good balance of lather and conditioner.  SOme of the stuff my wife tries to get me to use have way too much of a &#x27;softness&#x27; to them.  I feel like I barely get clean with that.  This stuff lathers nice, smells good and doesn&#x27;t have that &#x27;flowery&#x27; or baby powder smell.  I&#x27;ll definitely purchase them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Bonus - these look really good in the &#x27;guest box&#x27; you always want to give folks that visit WITHOUT having the guys looking at you and smirking going &#x27;awww, isn&#x27;t that nice?  Brandon uses &amp;#34;notreallymanly soap.&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li> Usually I don&#x27;t promise myself to buy the same soap again however this soap is dense meaning it lasts a long time plus while a lot of soaps do not retain the scent for long this one does.</li>
            <li> This was a gift.  It was appreciated when opened but have not heard anything about how it was to use. He liked the idea of it being a men&#x27;s soap and not a &amp;#34;fancy soap&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The only soap set this dude will ever use from now on. Mistral nailed-it on great men&#x27;s soaps. Because it&#x27;s also produced from mostly vegetable ingredients makes it a big plus as well --- but gets the shower and face washing job done very well, with a manly all day after-shower scent.</li>
            <li> I love all four bars of this brand, great smell and easily delivered thanks to amazon....</li>
            <li> Odor very strong. Bars very big. Didn&#x27;t use it but wouldn&#x27;t buy again. I was just curious about this. Save your money.</li>
            <li> Next to the Herban cowboy dusk deodorant milled soap, these are only of 2 kinds of soap that i possess and will keep buying. It&#x27;s $10.50 a bar of soap, it&#x27;s extremely expensive no doubt..but the fragrance of these soaps!? OMG! I personally think that whoever made these soaps must have put a bottle of very expensive men&#x27;s cologne, the type of perfume that you only get from Macy&#x27;s and Neiman Marcus because the scent stays with you almost the whole day. But then again it&#x27;s Made in France and it&#x27;s a milled soap meaning they spent a lot of time care research &amp; effort making these and you know the French whose synonimous with perfection. These are the soaps MADE FOR THE GODS because it&#x27;s luxurious, very pricey but worth it. it&#x27;s a BIG BAR of soap and this soap does NOT fit in your average sized soap container.The last Mistral soap bar I bought before buying these 4 bars lasted me 5 MONTHS of everyday showers!!! I love taking showers, sometimes 2X a day specially with a luxury soaps like these. You only live once to try the VERY BEST of everything and you&#x27;re not getting any younger as each day goes by..so why not try and buy the very best that your hard earned money can afford!?</li>
            <li> I gave this as a birthday gift and the recipient loved it.  If you&#x27;re looking for a gift for a guy that is hard to buy for, this is a great idea.</li>
            <li> I have sensentive skin, this product so far has proven to be mild enough to thorougly cleanse me without drying my hide excessively. The bars are large-great for men like me who have big hands. It lathers great, rinses off clean without residue and smells good . No harsh girly perfumes, you smell like a clean man after using this product. Most of all my wife likes it.  So far I am pleased.</li>
            <li> My husband is often hard to buy gifts for because he is picky, but he loves these soaps. The scents are perfect,</li>
            <li> My hubs LOVES it!  He smells so good when he steps out the shower with any of theses soaps!  A bit pricey?  Yes, but a worthwhile indulgence!  This is my 4th order...just try one bar!  You will not be sorry! UPDATE: I think I wrote that last review about 8 orders ago!  Try just one bar!  Sooo worth it.   Hubs is getting about 10 bars this Christmas!  (Shhhhh!) Bu he has been a VERY good boy</li>
            <li> Big man size bars that lather up nicely.  Nice earthy scents - none of that kissy sweet stuff.  Great buy for a luxury mens item.</li>
            <li> This made a very nice gift. Very elegantly packaged and the fragrances were wonderful.</li>
            <li> I split this up for gifts.  The recipients love the fragrances.  Good quality soaps too.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something that will be both a surprise as well as something that 99% of men will truly like then go with this gift set of soap. I&#x27;ve used it for not only my son on his birthday but also for my brother, Dad &amp; nephew. Needless to say ALL of them really liked this and a couple of them have actually asked for it again. Trust me, the different fragrances that come in this set will zero in on everyone you give it to and each will end up with their favorite. The Sandalwood &amp; Black Amber seem to be the two most prominent but overall all of them are always truly enjoyed. Besides, when was the last time you bought your Dad a bar of soap??. . . :) Give it a try, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> All smell very masculine and these bars last forever.</li>
            <li> They last a long time and it was a refreshing change from other mens soaps that I usually get at Walmart.</li>
            <li> Really good soap, a little more expensive but smells good.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying all of these soaps smell fantastic.  They do not leave an over-perfumey scent but give you a great, an pretty manly smell for the situations in which women are in close contact and I have had compliments each time a moment like that has arose.  I would definitely suggest the gift set as the first purchase.  All smell great but you will definitely find a favorite (Marin is mine).&lt;br /&gt;Smelling good is something men should strive for but wearing cologne can be overpowering and is expensive to try to use every day.  These soaps so the job and more when it comes to impressing a significant other at all times.</li>
            <li> Not much to say here... Mistral makes a great soap... lathers well, smells great, lasts, cleans and is just sexy. Price is obviously a factor, but if you can afford it, please, give this soap a try.</li>
