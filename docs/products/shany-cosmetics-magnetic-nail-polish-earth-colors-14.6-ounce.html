            <li>The colors are nice and it goes on well, but I could NOT get the magnetic thing to work!</li>
            <li>The price is good as well.</li>

            <li>and they loved it.</li>
            <li>Most people don&#x27;t know how this works, what you do is paint your nails with the beautiful nail polish that is in the kit, then you hold the magnet of your choice over your nail an</li>
            <li>The colors are much more beautiful than I thought they would be.</li>
            <li>Right after I ordered this I read through a bunch of comments to see which people had the best advice.  </li>
            <li>This is a really good set, nice colors and the magnet gives more life to your nails!</li>
            <li>Also dries very fast, so it is wonderful to use on my daughter!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>I fell in love with these nail polishes!</li>
            <li>I jus received these yesterday, and I love them!</li>
            <li>I put on a good top coat.  </li>
            <li>It all sounds time consuming, but I take time doing my nails no matter what kind of polish I am using.  </li>
            <li>Hazardous items can not be shipped expedited 2 day.  </li>
            <li>And it came in a nice box too to store them.</li>
            <li>She loves polishes and doing all that nice stuff with them.</li>
            <li>The colors are nice as well.</li>
            <li>The color looks nice.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a learning curve in terms of figuring out how much polish to put on to get the best effect</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so rare to see all of these gorgeous colors in one kit!</li>
            <li>There is a perfect mix of colors, easy to apply and the magnetic designs work really well.</li>
            <li>I like being able to mix and match colors and magnets.</li>
            <li>Pull the magnet off the bottle top.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)  </li>
            <li>&#x3D;)  </li>
            <li>When I tried to return it, I wasn&#x27;t allowed to because it&#x27;s flammable, yet they were able to deliver it to me.  </li>
            <li>After trial and error through some advice, I find the following works best for myself.  </li>
            <li>am enjoying using these colors that aside from purple</li>
            <li>I am really enjoying every product I have purchased from this company from cosmetics to organizing and travel carriers.  </li>
            <li>I love it!.Works just like it should.</li>
            <li>and also they come with different designs which is awesome!</li>
            <li>I Love the variety of colors.</li>
            <li>I love this alot</li>
            <li>SO MANY COLORS</li>
            <li>I love magnetic fingernail polish.</li>
            <li>Love magnetic nail polish...</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fun and works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li>I play it up sometimes and do more than one color on my hand.</li>
            <li>but they work beautifully for my 12 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>I think the one nail at a time is an important aspect that many people miss.  </li>
            <li>true to what they say!</li>
            <li>Very much more economical!</li>
            <li>Lasts a while, but it&#x27;s easy to remove.</li>
            <li>If not you need to as it goes on so easy and lasts for awhile.</li>
            <li>This is my first time buying magnetic nail polish so this was a nice deal to me.</li>
            <li>Love all of the colors, and the whole magnetic design is very cool!</li>
            <li>However, I got one hand done just fine</li>
            <li>I did my toes just fine.</li>
            <li>Everything was fine till i opened the nail polish</li>
            <li>but these were fine too.</li>
            <li>you get a gorgeous professional nail look!</li>
            <li>While the &amp;#34;magnetic design patterns&amp;#34; do work, unless you have HUGE nails (as presented in the pictures)</li>
            <li>note, I also have amazon prime and get everything 2 day shipping free.  </li>
            <li>My overall experience was great.</li>
            <li>That said - this is a great value to get 6 colors with different patterns.</li>
            <li>I also get the impression that women who use this product can spend many creative hours experimenting with the looks that they want, and this is the whole point of at-home manicures.</li>
            <li>Although I do find that each new magnet shape takes practice too, but I get it perfect now by the third nail.</li>
            <li>I recently bought this product and am super happy with it.</li>
            <li>the bottles are cute ;)</li>
            <li>but I used a light color Sally Hanson&#x27;s Color Quick for quick and easy application.&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li>I love the colors and the magnets provide the opportunity for a quick and pretty nail design to be created.</li>
            <li>We bought both heavenly and earth colors, and she likes the colors very much, and the magnetic properties of the product give the nails a great final touch.</li>
            <li>cool nail polish</li>
            <li>I think my nails look so cool.</li>
            <li>but it still looks cool.</li>
            <li>This kit also comes with stamps to attache to the nail polish which i have never tried but the patterens look way cool.</li>
            <li>I like the colors, and once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s pretty easy to do.  </li>
            <li>but I figure it out quickly.</li>
            <li>This is pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying this stuff!</li>
            <li>Polish is fine and delivery was fast and prompt.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this so much that I just ordered the Heavenly Colors package.  </li>
            <li>Love the magnetic nail trend - and these colors are bright enough to be fun but muted enough to wear to work every day.  </li>
            <li>This magnetic nail polishes are so fun.</li>
            <li>that Shany came out with these, so much fun and</li>
            <li>Okay, so I must be old because I can&#x27;t get these to work</li>
            <li>and the designs are pretty cool</li>
            <li>The colors are rich and two coats is more than enough.</li>
            <li>Six super pretty magnetic nail polishes!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m right handed</li>
            <li>and it was my right hand</li>
            <li>One nail at a time - put on a *thicker* coat on one nail - then -right away-</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, I thought it would be very hard to use at first, but actually the first nail I did was the one that came out the best.  </li>
            <li>I had one magnetic laquer before and liked it a lot, so wanted to try more, but this ones are not good, cause they don&#x27;t really reflect the magnetic shape and colors look cheap.</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant, and the patterns are really cool.</li>
            <li>I love the bright green especially.</li>
            <li>It takes getting used to so you can get the magnet as close as possible without touching the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The magnet pulls off the top of the nail polish allowing the polish brush and magnet to be two separate pieces but goes back on for convenient storage.</li>
            <li>but does not perform exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>and they work pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>to first time magnetic polish users:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>I would make the magnetic tops stronger to allow you to make pretty designs WITHOUT having to sit a microinch from the nails.</li>
            <li>So, if you want some pretty colors for around $5/bottle (which you can pay anywhere-and choose exactly which ones you want)</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t over the top glittery but just pretty enough have on at my job.</li>
            <li>I really like the shades of the polishes!</li>
            <li>Only one pattern repeats - lines - and it&#x27;s the most pronounced and visible one.</li>
            <li>my 16 year old daughter who was extremely excited her enthusiasm turned to it being &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It take practice, but once you get it down, i think it looks amazing.  </li>
            <li>Anyways, after the top coat is FULLY DRY</li>
            <li>I really like this nail polish..</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>I really like this kit</li>
            <li>Items packaged very well.  </li>
            <li>To get a nice thick coat of magnetic nail polish, I paint my nail in a few strokes then dip my brush for more polish and paint again all done quickly.</li>
            <li>She is enjoying the variety that she can get by using different caps/magnet patterns with different colors.</li>
            <li>Will definitely purchase more in the future!</li>
            <li>My favorite color is pink and the magnetic effect trend is still alive.</li>
            <li>You can make such neat designs with it and this set comes with some very pretty colors in it.</li>
            <li>I have a couple Sally Hansen magnetic polishes too, and once I nailed how to use the polish and magnets I have constant success.  </li>
            <li>But with normal wear Shany doesn&#x27;t chip.  </li>
            <li>After trial and error, I did finally get my right hand done.</li>
            <li>trick is to apply a regular size amount on your finger nail than right after hold the magnet up close to the nail polish.</li>
            <li>the magnetic device has to be held extremely close to the nail and the effect isnt as sharply detailed as shown on amazon pic</li>
            <li>its the new craze in nail polish.</li>
            <li>Shany offers these polishes at a decent price, speedy shipping and packaged well.</li>
            <li>key is to apply thick globs of magnetic nail polish and hold the magnetic tops close to the wet magnetic nail polish quickly and super close to your nail (like almost touching).</li>
            <li>I do not have any more chipping than I usually would.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m buying the other set on amazon which is actually $17.00 Another thing I love</li>
            <li>SUCH PRETTY COLORS</li>
            <li>Last week she was on a swimming pool for a couple of hours and one of the nails came up totally clean (with the polish totally removed), don&#x27;t know if that is because the quality of the product or the nails&#x27; exposure to the pool&#x27;s chemicals, but she had the polish applied just the day before that.</li>
            <li>Pretty and different in a subtle way unlike most nail art type things.</li>
            <li>I think this product offers a variety of color and designs.  </li>
            <li>I will update my rating if i can get these to issues fixed.</li>
            <li>I love the idea and the colors, but the magnets on the lids are just not strong enough to do anything without holding it so close you smidge your nails.</li>
            <li>The nail polish dries very quickly so use thick coats and immediately put the magnet over the nail as you go</li>
            <li>I believe I&#x27;m more clumsy with my left hand and wasn&#x27;t putting enough polish on and not holding the magnet correctly.</li>
            <li>It helps to hold the magnet over a little longer than suggested if you&#x27;re having trouble and make sure you put plenty of polish on the second coat.</li>
            <li>For the thumbs, I tilt the magnet pattern left and right for a few seconds to get the entire pattern to show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>3) Apply one thick coat of the magnetic nail polish on a finger nail QUICKLY and hold the magnets close to your nails as close as possible, using the stumps of the tops to rest against the cuticles and hold for 10 - 15 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>

            <li> We bought both heavenly and earth colors, and she likes the colors very much, and the magnetic properties of the product give the nails a great final touch.</li>
            <li> cool nail polish</li>
            <li> I think my nails look so cool.</li>
            <li> but it still looks cool.</li>
            <li> This kit also comes with stamps to attache to the nail polish which i have never tried but the patterens look way cool.</li>
            <li> I like the colors, and once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s pretty easy to do.  </li>
            <li> but I figure it out quickly.</li>
            <li> This is pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying this stuff!</li>
            <li> Polish is fine and delivery was fast and prompt.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this so much that I just ordered the Heavenly Colors package.  </li>
            <li> Love the magnetic nail trend - and these colors are bright enough to be fun but muted enough to wear to work every day.  </li>
            <li> This magnetic nail polishes are so fun.</li>
            <li> that Shany came out with these, so much fun and</li>
            <li> Okay, so I must be old because I can&#x27;t get these to work</li>
            <li> and the designs are pretty cool</li>
            <li> The colors are rich and two coats is more than enough.</li>
            <li> Six super pretty magnetic nail polishes!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m right handed</li>
            <li> and it was my right hand</li>
            <li> One nail at a time - put on a *thicker* coat on one nail - then -right away-</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I thought it would be very hard to use at first, but actually the first nail I did was the one that came out the best.  </li>
            <li> I had one magnetic laquer before and liked it a lot, so wanted to try more, but this ones are not good, cause they don&#x27;t really reflect the magnetic shape and colors look cheap.</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant, and the patterns are really cool.</li>
            <li> I love the bright green especially.</li>
            <li> It takes getting used to so you can get the magnet as close as possible without touching the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The magnet pulls off the top of the nail polish allowing the polish brush and magnet to be two separate pieces but goes back on for convenient storage.</li>
            <li> but does not perform exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> and they work pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> to first time magnetic polish users:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> I would make the magnetic tops stronger to allow you to make pretty designs WITHOUT having to sit a microinch from the nails.</li>
            <li> So, if you want some pretty colors for around $5/bottle (which you can pay anywhere-and choose exactly which ones you want)</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t over the top glittery but just pretty enough have on at my job.</li>
            <li> I really like the shades of the polishes!</li>
            <li> Only one pattern repeats - lines - and it&#x27;s the most pronounced and visible one.</li>
            <li> my 16 year old daughter who was extremely excited her enthusiasm turned to it being &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It take practice, but once you get it down, i think it looks amazing.  </li>
            <li> Anyways, after the top coat is FULLY DRY</li>
            <li> I really like this nail polish..</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I really like this kit</li>
            <li> Items packaged very well.  </li>
            <li> To get a nice thick coat of magnetic nail polish, I paint my nail in a few strokes then dip my brush for more polish and paint again all done quickly.</li>
            <li> She is enjoying the variety that she can get by using different caps/magnet patterns with different colors.</li>
            <li> Will definitely purchase more in the future!</li>
            <li> My favorite color is pink and the magnetic effect trend is still alive.</li>
            <li> You can make such neat designs with it and this set comes with some very pretty colors in it.</li>
            <li> I have a couple Sally Hansen magnetic polishes too, and once I nailed how to use the polish and magnets I have constant success.  </li>
            <li> But with normal wear Shany doesn&#x27;t chip.  </li>
            <li> After trial and error, I did finally get my right hand done.</li>
            <li> trick is to apply a regular size amount on your finger nail than right after hold the magnet up close to the nail polish.</li>
            <li> the magnetic device has to be held extremely close to the nail and the effect isnt as sharply detailed as shown on amazon pic</li>
            <li> its the new craze in nail polish.</li>
            <li> Shany offers these polishes at a decent price, speedy shipping and packaged well.</li>
            <li> key is to apply thick globs of magnetic nail polish and hold the magnetic tops close to the wet magnetic nail polish quickly and super close to your nail (like almost touching).</li>
            <li> I do not have any more chipping than I usually would.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m buying the other set on amazon which is actually $17.00 Another thing I love</li>
            <li> SUCH PRETTY COLORS</li>
            <li> Last week she was on a swimming pool for a couple of hours and one of the nails came up totally clean (with the polish totally removed), don&#x27;t know if that is because the quality of the product or the nails&#x27; exposure to the pool&#x27;s chemicals, but she had the polish applied just the day before that.</li>
            <li> Pretty and different in a subtle way unlike most nail art type things.</li>
            <li> I think this product offers a variety of color and designs.  </li>
            <li> I will update my rating if i can get these to issues fixed.</li>
            <li> I love the idea and the colors, but the magnets on the lids are just not strong enough to do anything without holding it so close you smidge your nails.</li>
            <li> The nail polish dries very quickly so use thick coats and immediately put the magnet over the nail as you go</li>
            <li> I believe I&#x27;m more clumsy with my left hand and wasn&#x27;t putting enough polish on and not holding the magnet correctly.</li>
            <li> It helps to hold the magnet over a little longer than suggested if you&#x27;re having trouble and make sure you put plenty of polish on the second coat.</li>
            <li> For the thumbs, I tilt the magnet pattern left and right for a few seconds to get the entire pattern to show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 3) Apply one thick coat of the magnetic nail polish on a finger nail QUICKLY and hold the magnets close to your nails as close as possible, using the stumps of the tops to rest against the cuticles and hold for 10 - 15 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> It looks very cool, almost like a fake nail - for someone who doesn&#x27;t know how the pattern was made it&#x27;ll look totally unreal.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Put on a normal, single thin coat first.</li>
            <li> I do not have this product, but I would want to know if it is long lasting.  </li>
            <li> They last a long time and it doesn&#x27;t chip!</li>
            <li> 6 magnetic nail polish for only $16.95, other brands for that price you could like only purchase 2.</li>
            <li> I let it dry COMPLETELY, then one nail at a time I put on a fairly thick coat and hold the magnet as close as possible for at least 20-25 seconds right after the coat of polish is applied.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t vouch for how long it stays on without chipping.</li>
            <li> I mean you hit your nail on a door or try to pry some things open and any brand of polish is doomed to chipping a tad; especially when like me your nails are natural.  </li>
            <li> and the other hand became a big pain.</li>
            <li> Once the polish starts to dry, it will not work.  </li>
            <li> The green is the least intense out of all them</li>
            <li> I also add Sally Hansen Miracle cure every few days, and it not only helps my nails grow but keeps polish from chipping.  </li>
            <li> The downside is that I got set #2 when I wanted set #1 for the pink and orange color</li>
            <li> Anyways: I put on a good base coat, then after it dries COMPLETELY, I put on a thin coat of the magnetic polish.  </li>
            <li> I have found that not letting each coat dry completely just leads to poor performance of the polish in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I used it by applying a single coat to each finger then a thick second coat and used the magnet immediately.</li>
            <li> I love the concept, but am disappointed that SHANY decided to send me an imperfect collection.</li>
            <li> not like other brands where its just one..</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t know if you can prevent it to wear off if you apply some other product over this one.</li>
            <li> Let dry for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> The magnets literally pull the polish into the pattern, so it has to be thick enough to move.</li>
            <li> It was half gone and semi-dried up, clumps on the edge made it appear that it had previously been used.  </li>
            <li> the effect is so minor that it is hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> I received two purples and am missing the reddish (magenta) color that is shown.  </li>
            <li> knocked one star off because two of the bottles were not closed tight enough and leaked 1/3 of the polish  :(</li>
            <li> the effect is so small as to be unnoticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have all amazon verified purchases on my 100+ reviews and this is one of the very few 1 star reviews I have.  </li>
            <li> The polish has to be put on so thickly for the magnets to work that it takes forever for it to dry.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> Two out the Six polish had broken brushes.</li>
            <li> 1) Apply one thin coat of nail polish base and wait to let dry.</li>
            <li> So i was unable to use those to colors.</li>
            <li> Purchased separately these types of nail polish are very expensive.</li>
            <li> I like the no animal testing all the way through and have yet to be disappointed in Shany.  </li>

            <li> I recently bought this product and am super happy with it. The colors are rich and two coats is more than enough. I like being able to mix and match colors and magnets. I used it by applying a single coat to each finger then a thick second coat and used the magnet immediately. It takes getting used to so you can get the magnet as close as possible without touching the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helpful tip: Pull the magnet off the bottle top. The magnet pulls off the top of the nail polish allowing the polish brush and magnet to be two separate pieces but goes back on for convenient storage.</li>
            <li> cool nail polish but does not perform exactly as pictured. the magnetic device has to be held extremely close to the nail and the effect isnt as sharply detailed as shown on amazon pic</li>
            <li> I think this product offers a variety of color and designs.  I would purchase this product again.  The price is good as well.</li>
            <li> I really like this nail polish.. However, I got one hand done just fine and the other hand became a big pain. I&#x27;m right handed and it was my right hand giving me all the problems. But I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s the products fault. I believe I&#x27;m more clumsy with my left hand and wasn&#x27;t putting enough polish on and not holding the magnet correctly. After trial and error, I did finally get my right hand done. I did my toes just fine. &#x3D;)  I think my nails look so cool. &#x3D;)  It helps to hold the magnet over a little longer than suggested if you&#x27;re having trouble and make sure you put plenty of polish on the second coat. That&#x27;s the one that matters.</li>
            <li> i got these for my wife for a gift and they work pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;the trick is to apply a regular size amount on your finger nail than right after hold the magnet up close to the nail polish. you only need to hold the magnet there for like 10 seconds if that.&lt;br /&gt;My wife loves it!</li>
            <li> Color is so nice.&lt;br /&gt;Color are magnetic and wonderful&lt;br /&gt;Design style perfect and stylist&lt;br /&gt;Best for this price .! !</li>
            <li> We received one bottle in this set that obviously had already been used.  It was half gone and semi-dried up, clumps on the edge made it appear that it had previously been used.  When I tried to return it, I wasn&#x27;t allowed to because it&#x27;s flammable, yet they were able to deliver it to me.  I love the concept, but am disappointed that SHANY decided to send me an imperfect collection.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this! The colors are vibrant, and the patterns are really cool. You can mix and match any of them. This is a great deal, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip to first time magnetic polish users:&lt;br /&gt;1. Put on a normal, single thin coat first. Let dry for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;2. One nail at a time - put on a *thicker* coat on one nail - then -right away- rest the curved part of the magnet just below your cuticle for 10-20 seconds. (Try not to touch your nail to the magnet but get as close as you can!)&lt;br /&gt;  The magnets literally pull the polish into the pattern, so it has to be thick enough to move.</li>
            <li> Right after I ordered this I read through a bunch of comments to see which people had the best advice.  It take practice, but once you get it down, i think it looks amazing.  Pretty and different in a subtle way unlike most nail art type things. After trial and error through some advice, I find the following works best for myself.  Although I do find that each new magnet shape takes practice too, but I get it perfect now by the third nail. Anyways: I put on a good base coat, then after it dries COMPLETELY, I put on a thin coat of the magnetic polish.  I let it dry COMPLETELY, then one nail at a time I put on a fairly thick coat and hold the magnet as close as possible for at least 20-25 seconds right after the coat of polish is applied.  I think the one nail at a time is an important aspect that many people miss.  Once the polish starts to dry, it will not work.  Anyways, after the top coat is FULLY DRY I put on a good top coat.  I also add Sally Hansen Miracle cure every few days, and it not only helps my nails grow but keeps polish from chipping.  It all sounds time consuming, but I take time doing my nails no matter what kind of polish I am using.  I have found that not letting each coat dry completely just leads to poor performance of the polish in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am enjoying using these colors that aside from purple I have never tried before.  I enjoy this so much that I just ordered the Heavenly Colors package.  I have a couple Sally Hansen magnetic polishes too, and once I nailed how to use the polish and magnets I have constant success.  I like how the Shany polish applies.  I do not have any more chipping than I usually would.  I mean you hit your nail on a door or try to pry some things open and any brand of polish is doomed to chipping a tad; especially when like me your nails are natural.  But with normal wear Shany doesn&#x27;t chip.  I am really enjoying every product I have purchased from this company from cosmetics to organizing and travel carriers.  I like the no animal testing all the way through and have yet to be disappointed in Shany.  I will be sticking with them quite a bit!iers.

            <li> This magnetic nail polishes are so fun. And the colors that come in this set, the earthy tones, are perfect for this upcoming season, fall!</li>
            <li> Six super pretty magnetic nail polishes!&lt;br /&gt;Love that Shany came out with these, so much fun and the bottles are cute ;)</li>
            <li> I love it!.Works just like it should. Used it for Homecoming and everyone loved my nails.Package arrived on time and in good condition</li>
            <li> The polish has to be put on so thickly for the magnets to work that it takes forever for it to dry.&lt;br /&gt;Then the effect is so minor that it is hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my daughter for Christmas.  I have to say, I had never heard of these before.  After you paint your nails, you tip the lid over your nail and it leaves a design.  It is so neat.  Your nails look like you paid a lot at a salon.  Great concept!</li>
            <li> I love the idea and the colors, but the magnets on the lids are just not strong enough to do anything without holding it so close you smidge your nails. I would make the magnetic tops stronger to allow you to make pretty designs WITHOUT having to sit a microinch from the nails.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I must be old because I can&#x27;t get these to work but they work beautifully for my 12 year old daughter. Purchased separately these types of nail polish are very expensive. This package of 6 colors and patterns is a great value. She is enjoying the variety that she can get by using different caps/magnet patterns with different colors. Thank you Shany for making my daughter&#x27;s Christmas brighter.</li>
            <li> I received this item in two days and I love it! My roommates and I have played with all the colors and they all work great! The green is the least intense out of all them but it still looks cool. Warning!! The nail polish dries very quickly so use thick coats and immediately put the magnet over the nail as you go don&#x27;t wait until you painted all the nails it else it doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Purchased through amazon.  Since nail polish is flammable, amazon does not accept returns on this product.  I received two purples and am missing the reddish (magenta) color that is shown.  The reason I know it&#x27;s not correct is because each cap has a different magnetic pattern and my 2 have the same.  So no refund, exchange, or any way for me to get a replacement.  I guess I&#x27;m S.O.L. on this one.  Hope you don&#x27;t get screwed over like I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note, I also have amazon prime and get everything 2 day shipping free.  Hazardous items can not be shipped expedited 2 day.  So did not get my item within the 2 day time frame anyways.  Technically screwed twice.  I have all amazon verified purchases on my 100+ reviews and this is one of the very few 1 star reviews I have.  I also can&#x27;t leave seller feedback since it was shipped by amazon so I have to vent on the product review here instead.  But don&#x27;t say you weren&#x27;t warned.</li>
            <li> I had one magnetic laquer before and liked it a lot, so wanted to try more, but this ones are not good, cause they don&#x27;t really reflect the magnetic shape and colors look cheap.</li>
            <li> true to what they say! and also they come with different designs which is awesome! not like other brands where its just one.. these colors pop! and the designs are pretty cool and you can&#x27;t beat that price! get while you can!</li>
            <li> Most people don&#x27;t know how this works, what you do is paint your nails with the beautiful nail polish that is in the kit, then you hold the magnet of your choice over your nail an you get a gorgeous professional nail look! I really like this kit it works wonderfully and easily!</li>
            <li> Good product, even if a beginner (me) does have to guess at how it&#x27;s done.  I like the colors, and once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s pretty easy to do.  Lasts a while, but it&#x27;s easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Great Set of Polishes! I Love the variety of colors. This is my first time trying this stuff! Saw another brand in the store and it is much more expensive in that brand than with the Shany brand. Very much more economical!</li>
            <li> I ordered set 1 of the  Magnetic Nail polish and received set number 2. Not a big deal. Everything was fine till i opened the nail polish Two out the Six polish had broken brushes. So i was unable to use those to colors. My overall experience was great. Polish is fine and delivery was fast and prompt. I will update my rating if i can get these to issues fixed. Great product.</li>
            <li> The colors are nice and it goes on well, but I could NOT get the magnetic thing to work! I even tried all the magnets off my fridge - nothing - I DID get it to sorta work, one time on one nail - but that was it. So, if you want some pretty colors for around $5/bottle (which you can pay anywhere-and choose exactly which ones you want) then you could do this - but I don&#x27;t recommend it if you are hoping to get the magnetic effect for 1/2 the price of a drugstore - which is a shame, cause one of my friends tried some from the drugstore and it looked great.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a great purchase for the price. Love all of the colors, and the whole magnetic design is very cool! Also dries very fast, so it is wonderful to use on my daughter! Love them! Will definitely purchase more in the future!</li>
            <li> This is a really good set, nice colors and the magnet gives more life to your nails! I love this alot and I&#x27;m always doing my nails anyway!</li>
            <li> I love the colors and the magnets provide the opportunity for a quick and pretty nail design to be created.</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying magnetic nail polish so this was a nice deal to me. The item came to me in just one day! And it came in a nice box too to store them. The colors are much more beautiful than I thought they would be. The downside is that I got set #2 when I wanted set #1 for the pink and orange color but these were fine too. So I&#x27;m buying the other set on amazon which is actually $17.00 Another thing I love is that these are abit sparkly with tiniest glitter which is very nice. They aren&#x27;t over the top glittery but just pretty enough have on at my job. There was no instructions on how to use it but I figure it out quickly. Here is my recommended method to get the best results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to use:&lt;br /&gt;Step 1) Apply one thin coat of nail polish base and wait to let dry. You can use the magnetic nail polish but I used a light color Sally Hanson&#x27;s Color Quick for quick and easy application.&lt;br /&gt;Step 2) Notice that the magnets are the tops of the nail polish bottles and they will create the patterns for your nails. Decide a pattern you want from the tops of the nail polish bottles.&lt;br /&gt;Step 3) Apply one thick coat of the magnetic nail polish on a finger nail QUICKLY and hold the magnets close to your nails as close as possible, using the stumps of the tops to rest against the cuticles and hold for 10 - 15 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;Step 4) Repeat Step 2 and 3 for each finger. Done!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key is to apply thick globs of magnetic nail polish and hold the magnetic tops close to the wet magnetic nail polish quickly and super close to your nail (like almost touching). To get a nice thick coat of magnetic nail polish, I paint my nail in a few strokes then dip my brush for more polish and paint again all done quickly. For the thumbs, I tilt the magnet pattern left and right for a few seconds to get the entire pattern to show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A+++ for beautifulness of the product for it&#x27;s price!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend is quite playful with her nails. She loves polishes and doing all that nice stuff with them. This product was something she simply had to try. We bought both heavenly and earth colors, and she likes the colors very much, and the magnetic properties of the product give the nails a great final touch. However, it only lasts about 2 days before starting to peel itself off the edges. Last week she was on a swimming pool for a couple of hours and one of the nails came up totally clean (with the polish totally removed), don&#x27;t know if that is because the quality of the product or the nails&#x27; exposure to the pool&#x27;s chemicals, but she had the polish applied just the day before that. I also don&#x27;t know if you can prevent it to wear off if you apply some other product over this one.</li>
            <li> SO MANY COLORS SUCH PRETTY COLORS THERE MAGNETIC ITS NOT TESTED ON ANIMALS  THEYBARE EARTH COLORS THERE MAGNETIC. oh and did i mention that there magnetic??!?!?</li>
            <li> I love magnetic fingernail polish. You can make such neat designs with it and this set comes with some very pretty colors in it. I love the bright green especially.</li>
            <li> While the &amp;#34;magnetic design patterns&amp;#34; do work, unless you have HUGE nails (as presented in the pictures) the effect is so small as to be unnoticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my 16 year old daughter who was extremely excited her enthusiasm turned to it being &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I do not have this product, but I would want to know if it is long lasting.  Based on the customer reviews, and the product image, I do get the impression that it is.  I also get the impression that women who use this product can spend many creative hours experimenting with the looks that they want, and this is the whole point of at-home manicures.</li>
            <li> Love magnetic nail polish...its the new craze in nail polish. This is a great value and way cheaper than going to the drugstore to purchase!! Great quality and excellent end results!</li>
            <li> Have you ever tried a magntic nail polish? If not you need to as it goes on so easy and lasts for awhile. This kit also comes with stamps to attache to the nail polish which i have never tried but the patterens look way cool. The colors are nice as well.</li>
            <li> This is pretty cheap. 6 magnetic nail polish for only $16.95, other brands for that price you could like only purchase 2. The color looks nice.</li>
            <li> Love the magnetic nail trend - and these colors are bright enough to be fun but muted enough to wear to work every day.  Create lots of patterns and designs!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I thought it would be very hard to use at first, but actually the first nail I did was the one that came out the best.  There&#x27;s a learning curve in terms of figuring out how much polish to put on to get the best effect but it&#x27;s fun and works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with these nail polishes! The colors are gorgeous! I really like the shades of the polishes! Good quality! They last a long time and it doesn&#x27;t chip!</li>
            <li> Obviously when I saw this I had to get it. It&#x27;s so rare to see all of these gorgeous colors in one kit! My favorite color is pink and the magnetic effect trend is still alive. I play it up sometimes and do more than one color on my hand.</li>
            <li> I jus received these yesterday, and I love them! There is a perfect mix of colors, easy to apply and the magnetic designs work really well. I&#x27;m a total nail polish freak and have been into this magnetic nail polish craze. Shany offers these polishes at a decent price, speedy shipping and packaged well. I can&#x27;t vouch for how long it stays on without chipping.</li>
            <li> Great buy.  The items are all of excellent quality.  Woth every penny.  Items packaged very well.  Purchased this for a gift and they loved it.</li>
            <li> I tried a similar polish before and it was $10/bottle from a local drug store. That said - this is a great value to get 6 colors with different patterns. Only one pattern repeats - lines - and it&#x27;s the most pronounced and visible one. It looks very cool, almost like a fake nail - for someone who doesn&#x27;t know how the pattern was made it&#x27;ll look totally unreal.&lt;br /&gt;I knocked one star off because two of the bottles were not closed tight enough and leaked 1/3 of the polish  :(</li>
