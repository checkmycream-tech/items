            <li>great product, smells great, and holds curls without drying out hair</li>
            <li>and AGAIN lol</li>
            <li>This stuff is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>My waves come in so nicely with this product.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend I to anyone honestly.</li>
            <li>This is the best natural hair line ever...  </li>
            <li>IT DID NOTHING MORE FOR IT</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on both my curls and smell of my hair.</li>
            <li>It also serves as more of a curl defined than it does a styler (ie.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a recomendation, and i still love it.</li>
            <li>This product smells great and does provide really nice initial hold and control</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft, and it has a very nice scent.</li>
            <li>It also smells fantastic</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>And to top it off it has a exotic scent to it because  of the aran oil mixed in.</li>
            <li>If it actually worked for my hair, I would continue just using it for the scent alone, which leaves my hair smelling amazing.</li>
            <li>leaves my hair soft not hard or greasy, curls defined, and the smell is exoticly sexy... 5 star product all day!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll just say it&#x27;s not the right product for me.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this creme as it is the only thing that works for my Dominican curls!</li>
            <li>I love this line of products my hair is very short and color treated.</li>
            <li>One for the effectiveness, the other for the amazing scent.</li>
            <li>There too many products that dry my hair out and change the color.....</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t see that it did much for my hair.</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I like that very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really tell if it was because of this product or the leave-in...</li>
            <li>Thanks Crème of Nature.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t give my hair that ugly crunchy look and has perfect balance of hold and softness.</li>
            <li>bought this at my local hair stop but wanted to leave a review as an avid review reader,  </li>
            <li>But again, every head is different, and I see a lot of people have had positive experiences with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used this stuff in my hair and it is soft while displaying my natural Curl pattern...  </li>
            <li>But, as far as curl definition and softness, it doesn&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
            <li>WOW....</li>
            <li>I cannot get past the STRONG smell.  </li>
            <li>I bought it as a recommendation from a hair guru that I follow on Youtube for natural hair tips; however, one thing I&#x27;ve learned is that every head of hair is different and you have to do what works for YOU and your hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have 4c African American natural hair</li>
            <li>I sat under my Laila Ali Ionic Soft Bonnet Dryer for almost an hour, but when I took it down, my hair felt dry and looked really frizzy on the ends.</li>
            <li>My really soft, however it is also dry and without any definition.</li>

            <li> tried it with the Creme of Nature Argan Oil Leave-in-conditioner and did flat twists.</li>
            <li> While it does look really pretty and does a great job that heavy cologne smell is terrible!</li>
            <li> For my normal hair routine, I usually just try to do wash n go&#x27;s</li>

            <li> and it was still insanely dry.</li>

            <li> (W&amp;G) but other products I&#x27;ve used just did not do what this one does.</li>
            <li> I will use this to slick down flyaways on braids and ponytails until it&#x27;s gone, but I definitely won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> This product left my hair dey, hard and increased tangling.</li>
            <li> thjs products doesn&#x27;t dry out nor change my hard work.</li>
            <li> My curl definition usually comes out (although not frizz-free) with me using water and shea butter and twisting it overnight.</li>
            <li> My hair still felt a little dry, but not as bad or as frizzy as it was when I used both products together.</li>
            <li> just don&#x27;t want to make it seem like it&#x27;s a bad product, because I don&#x27;t know that it is, so</li>
            <li> Smells horrible.</li>

            <li> Great curl styling pudding.</li>
            <li> This product tames fly away hair and keeps hair in place. I use this on my granddaughters ponytails and they last throughout the school day.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I HAVE CURLY HAIR IT DID NOTHING MORE FOR IT PLUS LEAVES MY STIICKY THE NEXT DAY</li>
            <li> not what i expect it to be</li>
            <li> This product also leaves a white residue. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. I have 4c African American natural hair and I didn&#x27;t see that it did much for my hair. But everybody&#x27;s hair is different.</li>
            <li> I cannot get past the STRONG smell.  I used this product in my toddlers curly hair.  While it does look really pretty and does a great job that heavy cologne smell is terrible!</li>
            <li> I have a combination of 4b/4c hair that I&#x27;ve  struggled to work with for quite some time. For my normal hair routine, I usually just try to do wash n go&#x27;s (W&amp;G) but other products I&#x27;ve used just did not do what this one does. This stuff is AMAZING! After deep conditioning I use this for my W&amp;G and it maximizes every single curl on my head even ones with slight heat damage. And to top it off it has a exotic scent to it because  of the aran oil mixed in. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on both my curls and smell of my hair. Keep in mind this product maximizes the curls you ALREADY HAVE. So if you&#x27;re transitioning or have a relaxer it may not work as well. It also serves as more of a curl defined than it does a styler (ie. Twist outs, braidouts, ect.) Otherwise, I recommend 110%!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this creme as it is the only thing that works for my Dominican curls! Doesn&#x27;t give my hair that ugly crunchy look and has perfect balance of hold and softness. I recommend this pudding. It also smells fantastic and I swear by it.</li>
            <li> This is the best natural hair line ever...  I used this stuff in my hair and it is soft while displaying my natural Curl pattern...  I will be using this all summer...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful on my sis hair</li>
            <li> When I had relaxed hair, I used to swear by Creme of Nature products, which always left my hair with slip and a lot of shine. So, I decided to give their pudding perfection a try. It was a total miss for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The positives of this product is that is smells divine. If it actually worked for my hair, I would continue just using it for the scent alone, which leaves my hair smelling amazing. But, as far as curl definition and softness, it doesn&#x27;t work at all.  I have 4a/b hair type. I thought it would leave my hair frizz-free and with curly definition. It did not. My really soft, however it is also dry and without any definition. My curl definition usually comes out (although not frizz-free) with me using water and shea butter and twisting it overnight. My hair just looks like a frizzy poof today, after using it. Won&#x27;t be using it anymore, unless it&#x27;s just for a scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it two stars. One for the effectiveness, the other for the amazing scent.</li>
            <li> Smells horrible. Leaves my hair dry and crunchy.</li>
            <li> I really like it.  It leaves my hair soft, and it has a very nice scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the fence about this. I bought it as a recommendation from a hair guru that I follow on Youtube for natural hair tips; however, one thing I&#x27;ve learned is that every head of hair is different and you have to do what works for YOU and your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells wonderful. I like that very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it with the Creme of Nature Argan Oil Leave-in-conditioner and did flat twists. I sat under my Laila Ali Ionic Soft Bonnet Dryer for almost an hour, but when I took it down, my hair felt dry and looked really frizzy on the ends. I couldn&#x27;t really tell if it was because of this product or the leave-in...so, I washed my hair and started over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time around, I just used this pudding perfection and did chunky two-strand twists. My hair still felt a little dry, but not as bad or as frizzy as it was when I used both products together. I don&#x27;t think that I obtained anything by adding this product to my styling tools that I wouldn&#x27;t get without it. So, for that reason, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s something that I would spend $10 on again. But again, every head is different, and I see a lot of people have had positive experiences with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just don&#x27;t want to make it seem like it&#x27;s a bad product, because I don&#x27;t know that it is, so I&#x27;ll just say it&#x27;s not the right product for me.</li>
            <li> I have a combination of 3c/4a hair. This product smells great and does provide really nice initial hold and control but once it&#x27;s dry it leaves my hair dry like straw. I tried coupling it with an oil and it was still insanely dry. I will use this to slick down flyaways on braids and ponytails until it&#x27;s gone, but I definitely won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> bought this at my local hair stop but wanted to leave a review as an avid review reader,  my take: I never ever use another curl creame/pudding EVER!! leaves my hair soft not hard or greasy, curls defined, and the smell is exoticly sexy... 5 star product all day!</li>
            <li> great product, smells great, and holds curls without drying out hair</li>
            <li> Too pasty for my taste.</li>
            <li> I found this product great for my hair!!! really love it!!! Good price too!!</li>
            <li> I love this line of products my hair is very short and color treated. There too many products that dry my hair out and change the color.....thjs products doesn&#x27;t dry out nor change my hard work. My waves come in so nicely with this product. I will buy again...and again...and AGAIN lol</li>
            <li> I bought this as a recomendation, and i still love it. It does the work!!</li>
            <li> WOW....Best curl crème.Thanks Crème of Nature.</li>
            <li> This product left my hair dey, hard and increased tangling. I would not recommend I to anyone honestly.</li>
