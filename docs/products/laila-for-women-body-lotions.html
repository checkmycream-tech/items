            <li>It is wonderful to layer both lotion and perfume because it&#x27;s a fairly mild scent to begin with - but if you&#x27;re going to pick just one of the two, I&#x27;d recommend the lotion, which tends to linger quite a bit longer.</li>

            <li> I first tried this lotion on a whim while visiting Epcot at Disney. I was amazed at how soft my skin was immediately. Worth every penny, feels smooth and soft without being greasy. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the moisterizing effects</li>
            <li> Okay, why would they brand this as lotion for women? Guys aren&#x27;t allowed to use lotion?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this lotion, its not too greasy, absorbs really well, and smells pretty awesome. I keep one at home, in my car, and at work. Pumps the perfect amount for your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essence of Norway!</li>
            <li> Great purchase. I use it all the time</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing! I got it at Disney world and I&#x27;m so glad that I found it on here so I can continue to buy it. This lotion has the most Amazing,fresh, and clean smell. It&#x27;s not too girly ether so it&#x27;s perfect for men and women. It&#x27;s a but pricy but it&#x27;s worth it, trust me! It leaves your skin feeling an smelling great for hours!</li>
            <li> Excellent perfum, no greasy at all. From a man point of view.... excellent.</li>
            <li> Smells divine ckean fresh light unlike any other fragrances.  Very moisturizing</li>
            <li> Great fragrance! I love this perfume! The fragrance is beautiful ans it last all day long! This is one of my favorite fragrances!</li>
            <li> Bought it first at Norway Disney Epcot &amp; liked it a lot but hard to find here.  Amazon to the rescue.  Would love to find their Geir lotion for men--available at Disney but have not found it online as yet.  Geir/Laila don&#x27;t seem to be widely known or available in the states as yet.  Hurray for Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance, andI use the cologne every day.  But this lotion just doesn&#x27;t have enough staying power.  It&#x27;s very expensive for a 10 minute aroma.. I haven&#x27;t used it much due to my disappointment.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.  The scent is clean and fresh.  The lotion leaves your body smooth but not oily.  HIGHLY recommend this.</li>
            <li> Love it. Got here faster than anticipated!</li>
            <li> I have worn Laila for 10 years and still get compliments when I wear it....I also like the fragrance and the body wash.....Lovely</li>
            <li> Started buying this in Disneyworld. If you like a soft, clean scent then you are going to LOVE Laila!</li>
            <li> I love Laila! It has been my favorite for many years now. Good, clean scent, not too over powering. Great!</li>
            <li> This lotion is wonderful. Very moisturizing and it smells soooo fresh and clean. The only problem is that it is quite pricey.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great! It does cost a lot but it is worth the price. I love it. I will be ordering it again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because everyone on a Disney message board I frequent seems to love Laila with an unmatched fervor.  I personally didn&#x27;t care for the fragrance, hence only 3 stars.  It was too sharp and somehow vaguely medicinal? Maybe it was just my body chemistry.    But that aside, if you like the fragrance, this is a good product. It is definitely light and non-greasy as other reviewers have said. And the reviewer who said the scent doesn&#x27;t last is nuts, because I (not liking how it smelled) have had to use it as a foot lotion in order to use it up without smelling it on me all day. When used as a hand lotion, it knocked me out any time I had my hands near my face, even hours later.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. It glides on as smooth as silk. It makes my skin feel and smell so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> If you like Bodytime&#x27;s China Rain, you will love this scent. It&#x27;s fresh and light. It is wonderful to layer both lotion and perfume because it&#x27;s a fairly mild scent to begin with - but if you&#x27;re going to pick just one of the two, I&#x27;d recommend the lotion, which tends to linger quite a bit longer. I get compliments on this one all the time!</li>
            <li> Reviews were helpful in determining if this was the product my wife wanted.  She got it for Christmas and loves it!</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion to pair with the perfume.  I really like this lotion, the scent is nice, not too over powering and it is not greasy.</li>
            <li> I originally found this cream at Walt Disney World EPCOT. I bought it because I loved the scent. Used it everyday we were there. Now it is the only cream I use. I&#x27;ve gone through 2 ½ bottles in a year. It&#x27;s not greasy and yet leaves my skin soft. We live in the desert so that is important to me. It is not easy to find, Amazon is the best.</li>
            <li> I love the refreshing smell, it always makes me smell like wild flowers.</li>
            <li> She loved the fresh scent of the Norwegian perfume, so I got her the matching body cream.  A little seems to go a long way, but is not heavy.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. Soft, light and it is my favorite of all time.</li>
