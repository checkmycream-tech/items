            <li>There the best shears I own</li>
            <li>Great scissors.</li>
            <li>I would suggest a good 7&amp;#34; pair of scissors over these but</li>
            <li>and they fit perfectly after that.  </li>
            <li>Amazing Shears, great price, over all a good buy :)</li>
            <li>Comes in a nice carrying case.</li>
            <li>Amazing sissor absolutely amazing highly recomemded very good price</li>
            <li>They also seem to work better with finer hair, and they are quite nice looking.</li>
            <li>This is a very fine pair of scissors.</li>
            <li>Pretty good quality, nothing amazing, but perfect for back ups.</li>
            <li>Great Product and was delivered as promised very prompt</li>
            <li>I love these</li>
            <li>I have large hands and they feel good</li>
            <li>I would not recommend these for every day use, but as a backup pair, they are fine.</li>
            <li>Look and sound cheap.  </li>
            <li>Im sure they will cut much nicer after getting them sharpend</li>
            <li>Good for smaller hands, too.</li>
            <li>Seriously the best pair of scissors I&#x27;ve ever owned</li>
            <li>but  one of the great cutting sissors I had ... very nice</li>
            <li>they are my new favorite go to shear</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I found these scissors to be very sharp and effective, even when using on myself!</li>
            <li>Not only do I love these</li>
            <li>Absolute worth the 5stars</li>
            <li>BUT you better have tiny fingers to use them</li>
            <li>When I first saw this.</li>
            <li>A little on the heavier side for a woman&#x27;s hand, nice appearance.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll still be using them years down the road.</li>
            <li>They are decent not for large hands can be a bit sharper</li>
            <li>I have big fingers and they fit comfortably enough.</li>
            <li>Be careful they really work;)</li>
            <li>Thwy hardly even were able to cut hair.</li>
            <li>Not for the professional stylist.</li>
            <li>Super sharp!</li>
            <li>Well made, very tight and precise.</li>
            <li>For what they are, they actually cut pretty well (they obviously don&#x27;t cut as well as $200 plus shears).</li>
            <li>These little blades are pretty straight despite the appearance- and are perfect for little dogs, and cutting around their eyes.</li>
            <li>these are worth buying if they are an alternative to your everyday pair</li>
            <li>this is the first time in 47 years I got new shears that are dull.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a guy with average size hands and they seemed small for my fingers at first.  </li>
            <li> So sharp you dont even hear them open and close.</li>
            <li> I am a stylist and was curious to see for myself just how well a pair of bargain shears would cut.</li>
            <li> but they are good enough for casual cutting...</li>
            <li> They were chipped and could tell they were previously sharpened , was expecting atleast unknicked shears.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at the price change, and that it only had one review, but I decided to purchase these shears anyway.</li>
            <li> They were very dull.</li>
            <li> They push hair away from the blades and are uncomfortable in my hand as well.</li>
            <li> Ive been cutting hair for 9 years bought these to add to the collection...</li>
            <li> Worst haircutting scissors ever used.</li>

            <li> This is a very fine pair of scissors. Comes in a nice carrying case. Would definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> A little on the heavier side for a woman&#x27;s hand, nice appearance.  Could have been sharper.  Im sure they will cut much nicer after getting them sharpend</li>

            <li> Pretty good quality, nothing amazing, but perfect for back ups.</li>
            <li> this is the first time in 47 years I got new shears that are dull. I like the feel, weight, looks. don&#x27;t like that I now have to pay to have them sharpened.</li>
            <li> My scissors looked and felt used. They were very dull. Thwy hardly even were able to cut hair.</li>
            <li> These little blades are pretty straight despite the appearance- and are perfect for little dogs, and cutting around their eyes.</li>
            <li> I took a chance on the price...and oh to my surprise these are great!!!! I have large hands and they feel good</li>
            <li> Ive been cutting hair for 9 years bought these to add to the collection... They are decent not for large hands can be a bit sharper but they are good enough for casual cutting... I would suggest a good 7&amp;#34; pair of scissors over these but these are worth buying if they are an alternative to your everyday pair</li>
            <li> Not only do I love these but so do my clients ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Absolute worth the 5stars</li>
            <li> Amazing sissor absolutely amazing highly recomemded very good price but  one of the great cutting sissors I had ... very nice</li>
            <li> Excellent cut!  I&#x27;m a guy with average size hands and they seemed small for my fingers at first.  I took out the rubber ring insert and they fit perfectly after that.  Now I hope my wife or kids don&#x27;t use them on ANYTHING else.  Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Nice cutting scissors BUT you better have tiny fingers to use them</li>
            <li> Great Product and was delivered as promised very prompt</li>
            <li> So sharp you dont even hear them open and close. I love these they are my new favorite go to shear</li>
            <li> Amazing Shears, great price, over all a good buy :)</li>
            <li> I am a stylist and was curious to see for myself just how well a pair of bargain shears would cut. For what they are, they actually cut pretty well (they obviously don&#x27;t cut as well as $200 plus shears). They are a bit heavier than I&#x27;m used to though. I would not recommend these for every day use, but as a backup pair, they are fine. They also seem to work better with finer hair, and they are quite nice looking.</li>
            <li> When I first saw this. I was skeptical at the price change, and that it only had one review, but I decided to purchase these shears anyway. They cut like 100+ dollar scissor for a fraction of the price. There the best shears I own and everybody asks me where I bought them.</li>
            <li> I found these scissors to be very sharp and effective, even when using on myself! Good for smaller hands, too.</li>
            <li> They were chipped and could tell they were previously sharpened , was expecting atleast unknicked shears. I wouldn&#x27;t choose these.</li>
            <li> Be careful they really work;)</li>
            <li> Great scissors. Can&#x27;t believe the price. A must buy item.</li>
            <li> Look and sound cheap.  Not for the professional stylist.</li>
            <li> Super sharp! I cut my dog&#x27;s fur with these and its effortless. Makes me a bit nervous at times because of that but hey, that&#x27;s the point. Well made, very tight and precise. I have big fingers and they fit comfortably enough. Not the biggest fan of the embroidered gem but it doesn&#x27;t effect the  performance or overall construction. Seriously the best pair of scissors I&#x27;ve ever owned and I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll still be using them years down the road. Well worth the money.</li>
