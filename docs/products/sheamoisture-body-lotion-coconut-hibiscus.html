            <li>Not too sweet, but clean and delicious.</li>
            <li>However, the scent is VERY strong.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m sure i will love them as well!</li>
            <li>No bad ingredients and smells amazing!</li>
            <li>This is a lovely lotion that applies smoothly, keeps my skin hydrated, is very gentle on my very-sensitive skin, and smells like the best of summertime.</li>
            <li>Great so far so good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very strong and smells mostly like mushrooms, because it has songyi mushroom extract in it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s on my &amp;#34;never run out&amp;#34; list :)</li>
            <li>Shea Moisture is my favorite brand.</li>
            <li>I love everything they stand for, their products work amazingly, and they are free from all the toxins that I avoid in beauty products.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>But why is it being sold for more than $20 on Amazon?  </li>
            <li>My scalp looked healthy.</li>
            <li>Love this nature non greasy lotion.  </li>
            <li>I love everything about this product.</li>
            <li>I like Jergens Shea Butter better</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>I also love the creaminess and richness of the lotion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great that this product is all natural and has no parabens, phthalates, paraffin, gluten, sulfates, or synthetic colors or fragrances.</li>
            <li>It also has the most wonderful smell, light and fruity, but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>free of parabens, phthalates, paraffin, formaldehyde, mireral oil, synthetic fragrance, no animal testing, no paba,</li>
            <li>but it leaves your skin with just a light fragrance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying more Shea Moisture products lately, and have been really impressed by them!  </li>
            <li>Usually my allergies have me avoiding products with fragrance, but this is delightful.</li>
            <li>but well worth it!</li>
            <li>Smells great and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>As a moisturizer , it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li>Microwave full bottle for 20-25 seconds so the Lotion comes out with ease</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really smell coconut, but the hibiscus is lovely.  </li>
            <li>too much hibiscus wanted more coconut smell.</li>
            <li>I loved the lotion, especially it being chemical-free.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful lotion for dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and will be ordering again for my homemade sunscreen</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t at all sensitive to strong scents, you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>I love that it is natural,non toxic cand organic and has Shea Butter,Cocoa butter and coconut oil- 3 of my favorite moisturizers that my dry skin loves</li>
            <li>This lotion is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>I often have allergic reactions to skin care products, so I turned to more natural alternatives.</li>
            <li>I love anything coco-nutty and this has just the right amount of natural coconut</li>
            <li>I had to wash it off right away.</li>
            <li>had a nice smell but every time I put it on, my skin still felt dry and it made my face oily.</li>
            <li>and it wouldn&#x27;t even be half as good.</li>
            <li>I keep this by the kitchen sink and use it several times a day, love the smell and how it feels.</li>
            <li>A bit on the thick side, but otherwise, great.</li>
            <li>It is like a deep conditioner but for your skin and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy, however gives your skin a lovely glow.</li>
            <li>I tried this one on my body first, then on the face.</li>
            <li>This lotion is natural, light in fragrance and consistency.</li>
            <li>I just used the Shea Moisture Coconut &amp; Hibiscus body lotion for the first time and I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li>When you first put it on you think the scent might be over powering</li>
            <li>Much cheaper!</li>
            <li>Apart from this minor downside, it&#x27;s a very good product that delivers long lasting moisture, smells great, does not irritate my skin, and is affordable compared to some other organic brands.</li>
            <li>My 70 year old hands now look more like 45 yr old hands.</li>
            <li>This lotion feels good on my skin, but I just can&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
            <li>The scent is entirely too strong.</li>
            <li>It smells great, but it&#x27;s so strong that it gave me crazy headaches.</li>
            <li>It feels very luxurious going on and something like this could easily cost double the price if you got some carol&#x27;s daughter equivalent or whatever</li>
            <li>I needed something to really help me with this winter weather</li>
            <li>Very cool!!!!The smell</li>
            <li>My skin is much healthier when I use this lotion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a plus that this product uses ethically traded ingredients that are sustainably produced.</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even smell the coconut or hibiscus much.</li>
            <li>but the yummy smell really won me over.</li>
            <li>It seems like they really care about the ingredients and the planet.</li>
            <li>Based on everyone else&#x27;s reviews, I really wanted to try this product.</li>
            <li>This is the first lotion I&#x27;ve tried by them, and it&#x27;s replaced my Alba Botanica lotions as my new fave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>You have to squeeze the bottle very hard to get something out even when it&#x27;s full to the top.</li>
            <li>I bought the lotion under my sister&#x27;s constant nagging and i am not disappointed at all, it&#x27;s soft and creamy and melt on you skin, it smells unbelievably good and is thick enough that you don&#x27;t need to apply a lot to nourish your skin.</li>
            <li>(I have a small office and people often walk in and comment on the lovely aroma.)</li>
            <li>Yummy smell, soft skin,</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the thick luscious cream</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and spreads with just a small amount.  </li>
            <li>The first ingredient listed on the label is coconut oil, so it&#x27;s the main ingredient, not just some filler way down on the ingredients</li>
            <li>Not only do I highly recommend this lotion</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and cleanly, no greasy residue.</li>
            <li>Goes on nice and thick, but absorbs well after a little while.</li>
            <li>(I live in San Diego, and our climate is very dry here.)  </li>

            <li> This product met expectation and then some!!!It got rid of my problematic dry skin patch on my knee.</li>
            <li> but I recommend every single product of theirs that I have tried.</li>
            <li> The product was not sealed and the cap was extremely loose allowing the lotion to leak all over the inside of the package.  </li>
            <li> You only need a little because it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My skin just drinks it up and does not look or feel dry again a few hours later nor does my skin feel too oily-</li>
            <li> The small doesn&#x27;t last too long, though, so it won&#x27;t interfere with perfumes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not very greasy.</li>
            <li> Little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Anyway,I can&#x27;t wait to try some of the other products in the line and the baby products as well.  </li>
            <li> I did not feel greasy or slimy (like other lotions that stay on your skin).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now half empty and it feels like the plastic is going to crack soon from the squeezing.</li>
            <li> For dry winters, I recommend their raw shea frankinscence lotion.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s way less money.</li>
            <li> so I recommend storing it upside down and giving it a firm tap on the counter before using.</li>
            <li> My bottle sits where the sun shines on it, and maybe that little bit of warmth helps?</li>
            <li> I can see how some could have trouble.  </li>
            <li> It was quite a mess!  </li>
            <li> Not sure if some of the ingredients spoiled or not</li>
            <li> The smell was not overwhelming at all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars for its lack of a bunch of nasty chemicals &amp; the fact that I love the scent &amp; my combination skin feels moisturized but not oily.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that they still have a small business/old fashioned vibe to them</li>
            <li> It is thick though, so</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s VERY thick</li>
            <li> I get this at my local Base Exchange for $10???</li>
            <li> It is very thick and difficult to get out of bottle.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell fake or overpowering and in combo with the honeysuckle that they also put in there</li>
            <li> A bit pricy for the size and the price continually has been increasing which is a disappointment, but for now this is my go to!</li>
            <li> I just received this product and was very disappointed upon opening the package.  </li>
            <li> The smell of this was horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Definitely would recommend to everyone. It&#x27;s like heaven in a bottle on your skin. It&#x27;s on my &amp;#34;never run out&amp;#34; list :)</li>
            <li> I used it to make home-made sunscreen. Feel as though it was a rip off, I think I could have found it cheaper than $14 elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying more Shea Moisture products lately, and have been really impressed by them!  This is the first lotion I&#x27;ve tried by them, and it&#x27;s replaced my Alba Botanica lotions as my new fave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent on this is amazing -- it smells like a pina colada!  It also leaves a nice sheen to your skin, hence the \\&quot;brightening\\&quot; it mentions on the label.  The small doesn&#x27;t last too long, though, so it won&#x27;t interfere with perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really does an excellent job of moisturizing, too.  I&#x27;ve been using it daily for about a month, and have noticed that my skin is softer.  (I live in San Diego, and our climate is very dry here.)  The first ingredient listed on the label is coconut oil, so it&#x27;s the main ingredient, not just some filler way down on the ingredients list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can also use this on my legs immediately after shaving, with no burning or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this!</li>
            <li> Smells good and works great!</li>
            <li> I just received this product and was very disappointed upon opening the package.  The product was not sealed and the cap was extremely loose allowing the lotion to leak all over the inside of the package.  It was quite a mess!  After paying such a high price for this item and receiving in such poor condition, I will never order this again.</li>
            <li> I keep this by the kitchen sink and use it several times a day, love the smell and how it feels.</li>
            <li> Great, hydrating lotion. A bit on the thick side, but otherwise, great.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant soft scent, it prevents my skin from looking all ashy, the best part is that I got it at Target for $10.99 not $20! are you kidding me?! free of parabens, phthalates, paraffin, formaldehyde, mireral oil, synthetic fragrance, no animal testing, no paba, no synthetic color no DEA no animal ingredients!!!! I love love it!!!!! I needed something to really help me with this winter weather and i found my solution! I thought I would have to go with the regular store chemical induced ones but nop.</li>
            <li> Shea butter is a great moisturizer. My 70 year old hands now look more like 45 yr old hands.</li>
            <li> Shea Moisture is my favorite brand. I love everything they stand for, their products work amazingly, and they are free from all the toxins that I avoid in beauty products. Not only do I highly recommend this lotion (it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve ever tried and I have tried a million) but I recommend every single product of theirs that I have tried. I have dry, itchy skin, and sometimes eczema flare ups. This lotion is soothing and hydrating. It&#x27;s VERY thick so I recommend storing it upside down and giving it a firm tap on the counter before using.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t not smell good</li>
            <li> Excellent product for the skin..</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Not very greasy. Does the job</li>
            <li> This lotion is by far my favorite. It is like a deep conditioner but for your skin and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy, however gives your skin a lovely glow. It lasts all day (except on your hands after washing of course) and smells very good. My daughter and I always get compliments about how great we smell. A bit pricy for the size and the price continually has been increasing which is a disappointment, but for now this is my go to!</li>
            <li> The smell of this was horrible. Not sure if some of the ingredients spoiled or not but I had to give it away.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! But why is it being sold for more than $20 on Amazon?  I get this at my local Base Exchange for $10???</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the thick luscious cream</li>
            <li> This body lotion is the best I have even used.  It goes on easy and spreads with just a small amount.  My skin feels supple hours after I use it.  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product met expectation and then some!!!It got rid of my problematic dry skin patch on my knee.Very cool!!!!The smell&lt;br /&gt;is nice and my skin almost drank it up and stays moist the entire day.</li>
            <li> I just bought the same one for $9.00 in Walmart.  I have not used this yet. But I have used shea moisture shampoo and I liked it. My scalp looked healthy. Seeing all the no&#x27;s on the label and the ingredients all basically sounds botanical made me to buy this. Ordering online is convenient but if you go to the local store...check there and buy.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells so good and it makes my skin feel amazing. You only need a little because it goes a long way. I suffer from acne and use this on my face and it provides the perfect moisturizer. I love it!</li>
            <li> This is a lovely lotion that applies smoothly, keeps my skin hydrated, is very gentle on my very-sensitive skin, and smells like the best of summertime. (I have a small office and people often walk in and comment on the lovely aroma.) Usually my allergies have me avoiding products with fragrance, but this is delightful.</li>
            <li> I wish I could say I loved it, but I didn&#x27;t :(&lt;br /&gt;It had a nice smell but every time I put it on, my skin still felt dry and it made my face oily.</li>
            <li> Great so far so good my skin feels great !</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful lotion for dry, sensitive skin. I often have allergic reactions to skin care products, so I turned to more natural alternatives. I tried this one on my body first, then on the face. No problems at all. Goes on nice and thick, but absorbs well after a little while. It also has the most wonderful smell, light and fruity, but not overwhelming. My skin feels great and I will definitely buy this lotion again. I am subtracting one star for the container it comes in. You have to squeeze the bottle very hard to get something out even when it&#x27;s full to the top. It&#x27;s now half empty and it feels like the plastic is going to crack soon from the squeezing. I wish it had a pump or came in a tub instead. Apart from this minor downside, it&#x27;s a very good product that delivers long lasting moisture, smells great, does not irritate my skin, and is affordable compared to some other organic brands. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought this while vacationing in Hawaii, I have very dry skin especially in the winter but this stuff is amazing!!! I couldn&#x27;t find it locally so I had to pay the price amazon charges but well worth it! I will definitely buy again!! The smell was not overwhelming at all I loved the smell of hibiscus flowers and it didn&#x27;t have the coconut smell that I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> This lotion is natural, light in fragrance and consistency. Smells very nice and shines the skin. I did find, however, that it is not moisturizing enough in winter. For dry winters, I recommend their raw shea frankinscence lotion.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely wonderful. No bad ingredients and smells amazing! Arrived quickly and will be ordering again for my homemade sunscreen</li>
            <li> Love this nature non greasy lotion.  Microwave full bottle for 20-25 seconds so the Lotion comes out with ease, otherwise it&#x27;s a struggle to get it out.</li>
            <li> This smells great and has a very rich texture.  It absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy.  My skin is much healthier when I use this lotion.</li>
            <li> I just used the Shea Moisture Coconut &amp; Hibiscus body lotion for the first time and I&#x27;m hooked. I love everything about this product. It moisturizes your skin without being greasy and leaves it feeling wonderful. When you first put it on you think the scent might be over powering but it leaves your skin with just a light fragrance. It&#x27;s great that this product is all natural and has no parabens, phthalates, paraffin, gluten, sulfates, or synthetic colors or fragrances. It&#x27;s also a plus that this product uses ethically traded ingredients that are sustainably produced.</li>
            <li> It is very thick and difficult to get out of bottle. As a moisturizer , it&#x27;s nothing special. I like Jergens Shea Butter better and it&#x27;s way less money.</li>
            <li> I bought the lotion under my sister&#x27;s constant nagging and i am not disappointed at all, it&#x27;s soft and creamy and melt on you skin, it smells unbelievably good and is thick enough that you don&#x27;t need to apply a lot to nourish your skin. I love</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this lotion! Smells great and lasts a long time. It&#x27;s almost been 12hrs since I applied this and I still smell great. I bought mine from Target. Much cheaper!</li>
            <li> Smells likea pina colada and adds a nice sheen to my skin without being too oily.</li>
            <li> The scent is entirely too strong.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion.  I don&#x27;t really smell coconut, but the hibiscus is lovely.  I have had no problem with expelling the lotion from the bottle as others have mentioned.  It is thick though, so I can see how some could have trouble.  My bottle sits where the sun shines on it, and maybe that little bit of warmth helps?</li>
            <li> smells so good and the smell lasts for ages</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars for its lack of a bunch of nasty chemicals &amp; the fact that I love the scent &amp; my combination skin feels moisturized but not oily.</li>
            <li> Yummy smell, soft skin, what more could you ask for? Absorbs quickly and cleanly, no greasy residue.</li>
            <li> Can u guys please ship this product to Germany.i really want to buy this because of the good reviews.pleassseeee!!!</li>
            <li> This lotion feels good on my skin, but I just can&#x27;t get past the smell. I had to wash it off right away. It&#x27;s very strong and smells mostly like mushrooms, because it has songyi mushroom extract in it. I can&#x27;t even smell the coconut or hibiscus much. I am definitely returning this to the store where I bought it!</li>
            <li> Great value. Nice smell. Daughter loves it. Little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad i tried this product! I had seen it at Tar-jay and finally got myself some for my birthday. I love that it is natural,non toxic cand organic and has Shea Butter,Cocoa butter and coconut oil- 3 of my favorite moisturizers that my dry skin loves but the yummy smell really won me over. I love anything coco-nutty and this has just the right amount of natural coconut scent.&lt;br /&gt;. It doesn&#x27;t smell fake or overpowering and in combo with the honeysuckle that they also put in there, it is very appealing. I also love the creaminess and richness of the lotion. It feels very luxurious going on and something like this could easily cost double the price if you got some carol&#x27;s daughter equivalent or whatever and it wouldn&#x27;t even be half as good.My skin just drinks it up and does not look or feel dry again a few hours later nor does my skin feel too oily- it just feels and looks well hydrated.  Even though this product is carried at  chain stores .now I like the fact that they still have a small business/old fashioned vibe to them It seems like they really care about the ingredients and the planet. They do not test on animals either. Anyway,I can&#x27;t wait to try some of the other products in the line and the baby products as well.  i&#x27;m sure i will love them as well!</li>
            <li> Based on everyone else&#x27;s reviews, I really wanted to try this product. I went to ShopRite to buy it, and it cost me $10.49. Smells wonderful! Not too sweet, but clean and delicious. My skin drank it up and after literally 3 minutes I did not feel greasy or slimy (like other lotions that stay on your skin). Very, VERY happy customer!</li>
            <li> too much hibiscus wanted more coconut smell. nice moisturizer though.</li>
            <li> I loved the lotion, especially it being chemical-free. However, the scent is VERY strong. If you aren&#x27;t at all sensitive to strong scents, you&#x27;ll be fine. If you do have the sensitivity that I have, I don&#x27;t recommend it. It smells great, but it&#x27;s so strong that it gave me crazy headaches.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells wonderful. I&#x27;m going to mix it with zinc oxide to make homemade sun screen and can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
