            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I went to a Japaneese merchant here and found a better grade of Shea Butter after I explained the condtions of the butter I purchased threw Amazon.</li>
            <li>So glad I tried this product and will continue with it.  </li>
            <li>and I would have lost most if not all of it.</li>
            <li>and i love</li>
            <li>and overall I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>I bought two to be sure I always have it on hand.</li>
            <li>I simply love this one though.  </li>
            <li>I am more inclined to believe this is coco butter.</li>
            <li>I love this shea butter and use it in making moisture cream.  </li>
            <li>and I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Your skin will love it.</li>
            <li>I hope to verify the rest of the claims and find more uses for this butter.</li>
            <li>I love to use shea butter in my hair products and for my skin</li>
            <li>I have used it all and need to order more.</li>
            <li>Product seems authentic.</li>
            <li>We are able to use this for her scalp, her hair, and as a lotion.</li>
            <li>I am a licensed massage therapist who does mostly MFR.</li>
            <li>My patients also love how it makes their skin feel softer and more hydrated after a massage session.</li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>I have found that it keeps my hair better conditioned and my skin more supple.</li>
            <li>think it&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li>and although it is a softer butter, it is more grainy and in my opinion...</li>
            <li>love the purity of this product.</li>
            <li>Have used on many projects and love the results.</li>
            <li>Love this product is is everything they said it was.</li>
            <li>I wasnt sure about using on my face</li>
            <li>but I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>Sooooooo many uses.</li>
            <li>They should&lt;br /&gt;be packaged better.</li>
            <li>I love this product and I will be buying more.  </li>
            <li>Although the smell isn&#x27;t very nice, it&#x27;s very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful for those of us with dry skin!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still very good for your skin, comparable to Shea&#x27;s quality, but a different product.</li>
            <li>(primary reason why i bought it).Two birds with one stone:)</li>
            <li>, I have never purchased filtered \\&quot;raw\\&quot; Shea Butter before, I assumed because it is NATURAL, that it would be a &#x27;good thing&#x27; and make a healthy skin lotion.</li>
            <li>it.love how it melts quickly and almost \\&quot;odorless\\&quot; (VERY important for work environment).</li>
            <li>It is yellow and it is smoky, but if you read about it is simply becuase the colors vary, it is roasted over a fire, and it is unrefined, mine came in good timing, and is an excellent quality product.  </li>
            <li>We spoke and he was very nice over the phone and advised he would have a second container shipped to me for free and packaged much better.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t love the consistency, but if you rub between your hands to heat up and melt a bit before applying to your feet or body it works much better.</li>
            <li>I have also tried using it on my face after I read some reviews about it reducing the appearance of fine lines</li>
            <li>If one is creative enough, it can work successfully.</li>
            <li>Some people describe it as nutty, I think it smells more like a mild camp-fire smokey scent.  </li>
            <li>This has been super helpful for my psoriasis plaques!</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Melts in your hands and goes on smoothly providing improvement and comfort to the skin.  </li>
            <li>Almost forgot the smell is so light which is a plus.</li>
            <li>African Shea Butter work great for just about every thing.</li>
            <li>It soften your hair,takes the inch away from insect bites,leaves skin smooth on hands and feet.</li>
            <li>This is defintely a great product for the entire body.</li>
            <li>and then it is fabulous.</li>
            <li>AS SMOOTH AS BUTTER.  </li>
            <li>I thought that the yellow-gold \\&quot;raw\\&quot; Butter would be healthier than the sterilized/odor free Shea Butter</li>
            <li>so it is important to keep this product in the fridge.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>so I did some research and found that raw shea butter is the best for your skin.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty sure that I&#x27;m not buying from here again.  </li>
            <li>I ordered some and saw an amazing improvement of my overall skin tone in about 3 weeks but even better</li>
            <li>Great item to use all year round, wish it came in a better container thou mine cracked in shipment, but still usable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I was looking for a healthy product that I could scent with essential oil/s, whereby making my own lotion/s.  </li>
            <li>Great for dry skin &amp; making creams</li>
            <li>not as good for the skin as the West African variety.</li>
            <li>and it is not a bad smell either.</li>
            <li>This butter repairs skin but leaves it with an odd smell but nothing good perfume wont fix. :)</li>
            <li>Other than that it is great, but does have a smell, so I would spritz with perfume as I rubbed in my skin.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, should I choose to purchase this item again the shipping is just as quick as the 1st time.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product, a definite staple in my daily beauty regimen.</li>
            <li>You only need a tiny amount and it does great stuff!</li>
            <li>Love the texture and it was more than enough to share.</li>
            <li>MIxed it with my essential oils for a wonderful lock in moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The product description was accurate and the shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to many of my massage therapist friends.</li>
            <li>Also, it is good for any minor skin irritations.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on healthy skin, sunburned skin, skin that had a rash on it, skin that was SUPER dry and on my hair to help with friz and static.  </li>
            <li>My original shipment came in damaged however customer service was prompt and friendly and the seller not only replaced it but sent me an additional tub for free!</li>
            <li>The shea has a light oily oder that I don&#x27;t really care for, but it is mild.  </li>
            <li>I like having the large tub of it to use freely.</li>
            <li>Having said that, the product be very good as far as itself seems to the expected results go.</li>
            <li>Delivery took some time but so worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Had it been summer time when it came it would have surely melted and run completely out of the container</li>
            <li>The product was as good as i expected.</li>
            <li>Personally, I am not crazy about the smell at all, a bit too earthy for me..</li>
            <li>The moisturizing quality is nice, and I&#x27;m currently blending it with coconut oil and using it as a belly rub for my pregnancy to ward off stretch marks.</li>
            <li>So I added more oil, and more, and more..., until finally, I had added 1/2 oz of essential oil to the 2 oz of Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li>My only hope is that if you do choose to buy it, that you have better luck than I did, and that you enjoy it.</li>
            <li>This keeps it fresh.</li>
            <li>I bought this tub thinking that I would make my own facial moisturizer and hair conditioner.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s cheaper than what I normally pay, lesson learned--get what you pay for!!!</li>
            <li>Best SPF sunscreen protection there is, I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now, it has replaced other lotions I use to use, now I&#x27;m hooked on 100% African Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>Used it while I was pregnant with my first on my tummy</li>
            <li>The Nilotica is okay for creams and hair use, but as like everything else, experiment for yourself and find your own truth, I just had to comment here because I see too many people talking hot mess about a good shea butter and elevating Nilotica and other high end stuff that really ain&#x27;t even all of that.</li>
            <li>Apply it right after a shower</li>
            <li>THAT I BROUGHT MELTS RIGHT INTO MY HAIR.  </li>
            <li>THE PRICE IS RIGHT</li>
            <li>Product is soft and Easy to use started using more frequently.  </li>
            <li>and it works so much better than most of the other brands!</li>
            <li>this is great Shea Butter good price very creamy my only complaint</li>
            <li>my skin soft, great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>My only hope is that if you do choose to buy it, that you have better luck than I did, and that you enjoy it.xing so much in with the Shea Butter and using it on my skin, was not the wisest thing</li>
            <li>I have also found that if I heat the Shea gently in a double boiler, to a liquid state, then let it cool, all of the graininess is removed, and I am left with a nice smooth product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you hands are dry and skin is flaking of this will make them look nice and shiny.</li>
            <li>I let the mixture stand and cure for 72 hours, but when I opened the jar all I could smell was the Shea with a very light hint of the essential oil.</li>
            <li>I make my own lotion for my very dry skin and found this Shea Butter to be exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I bought this, didn&#x27;t know what exactly i was going to use it for.  </li>
            <li>Its a bit &#x27;grainy&#x27; feeling at first, but all of the grains melt away as soon as I start to rub it in.</li>
            <li>A pea sized amount is more than enough to thoroughly moisturize my hands and wrists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is my first time buying filtered &amp; creamy Shea butter</li>
            <li>You can also find recipes online to whip the shea butter with your favorite essential oil and make it smell better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the complainers saying that \\&quot;It&#x27;s mustard yellow\\&quot; and that \\&quot;it should be white\\&quot; and it \\&quot;smells like ashes\\&quot; please research first before commenting.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying it.</li>
            <li>The smell is nauseating, very over bearing, and does not wear off!</li>
            <li>Thus I use it for my dog now when she is damp after baths to make her coat shiney and relieve hot spots.</li>
            <li>I have found that the African shea butter to be an outstanding product to use when doing myofascial techniques.</li>
            <li>and I really do feel like it makes my skin clearer and brighter!</li>
            <li>You have to work it very smooth for a long time.</li>
            <li>is the first time I have ever tried the pure shea butter</li>
            <li>anyway, I am willing to give this product 3 stars because it seemed OK when I used on my DRY skin.</li>
            <li>anyway, I am willing to give this product 3 stars because it seemed OK when I used on my DRY skin.</li>
            <li>Looking forward seing positive results  </li>
            <li>Easy enough</li>
            <li>I purchased this large container of what I thought was Shea butter.</li>
            <li>It leaves residue in the hair once it dries out, but that may be because it doesn&#x27;t blend well with certain products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d tried shea butter and other oils before, but this particular kind almost immediately made a difference.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Later, I made a rich, easy to slather on \\&quot;cream\\&quot; by blending olive oil with big chunks of shea butter in one of the small containers that came with my Magic Bullet.  </li>
            <li>I like the ivory just fine, but prefer the yellow</li>
            <li>It has a lot of vitamin E in it, too, apparently, along with a lot of other good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love my shea butter,I use it on my whole body,and my daughter who has dry skin softens it to the touch,It also helps my swollen feet ,I recommend this product it came right on time,and the price is well worth sending off for African Shea butter.</li>
            <li>I am sure my skin and my hair would have fallen to pieces by now if so, because I basically bathe in yellow shea butter from head to toe because the yellow is my own beauty secret and favorite variety.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin moisturizers when u put it on like the real Shea butter</li>
            <li>Product is better than expected.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve have several people ask me what is different about me, that I look more radiant and comment on my smooth, clear skin.  </li>

            <li>mo1N81MOQNXG9AJ]]Here is a video review of shea butter purchased from HalalEveryday vs. real shea butter from Back2Africa.</li>
            <li>From what I could tell, the one sold by HalalEveryday is indeed real shea butter.</li>
            <li>it becomes very creamy.   </li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was fast too</li>
            <li>Anyway, my hair isn&#x27;t greasy (who wants that)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even have a smell and shea butter is very odoriferous.</li>
            <li>This has been very helpful for my eczema.  </li>
            <li>No junk in it, just the real deal 100%.  </li>
            <li>, THEY HAD FAST SERVICE (because I was scare</li>
            <li>So mixing so much in with the Shea Butter and using it on my skin, was not the wisest thing</li>
            <li>It will emulsify and become a very creamy texture.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li>I thought that melting it would make it much smoother to add the oils and essenses&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>in all, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product, the amount is generous and will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li>I used to use it in making my own lotions, but now I just use it raw and unmixed.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely mixed with something else as shea butter is not white or yellow its more of a beige/ivory and its smooth in texture.</li>
            <li>so i contacted seller prior to arrival date and got reply right away!</li>
            <li>but that I can also share with my husband, who is dark hair/eyes and more ruddy complexion.  </li>
            <li>The hype is true about African Shea butter.</li>
            <li>Even the Mayo Clinic concoctions weren&#x27;t that effective in such a short amount of time, but my Mayo doctors gave shea butter their blessing--SPF4, I believe they said it was, as a natural sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>This is a huge tub of it too, so I think I&#x27;m set for a long time!</li>
            <li>I have had other butters with more fatty sustance in it and it spread better.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this.</li>
            <li>So as far as buying this or product NOT, is up is certainly up to you.  </li>

            <li>I just love this pure Shea Butter, I use everyday, for hair and skin!</li>
            <li>I would have to warm up because it was really hard.</li>
            <li>I have been using golden or yellow shea butter off and on as well as the high end  \\&quot;Nilotica\\</li>
            <li>As a senior adult, my skin has lost elasticity and the shea butter really helps with that.</li>
            <li>but I still need a few more weeks to see results...</li>
            <li>The scent only lasts until the shea butter is absorbed into your skin.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, it keeps my hair moisturized and my skin soft and its also clearing up my dark spots.</li>
            <li>I tried so many different over the counter moisturizers and nothing worked until I went back to my old stand-by.</li>
            <li>I have tried other shea butters and they were fine.  </li>
            <li>but it is not like the natural Shea butter I normally get from Africa!</li>
            <li>I stir the mixture up really well then allow it to sit and cool off stirring occasionally over the next day or so.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like (but can live with):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Live and learn.</li>
            <li>(Very much like buying ten pounds of paprika at Costco.)  </li>
            <li>so your skin will be warm enough to melt the butter and it absolutely will fix any rough, dry, cracking skin problems.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for something natural, but long lasting and good for my skin because I was breaking out with almost every other moisturizer I used.  </li>
            <li>On its own it no good.</li>
            <li>I have a small Glad container that I put about a cup into and wrap up the rest and put it in the fridge.</li>
            <li>As far as quality I have no complaints!</li>
            <li>It stayed oily for a few minutes and gradually absorbed right in, leaving the skin soft and supple with no greasy after-feel.</li>
            <li>It can be difficult to put on if you don&#x27;t warm it up first.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s consistency is like putty, so it is very very hard to smooth into your skin unless you have very hot hands and rub them together, and even then it&#x27;s the consistency of glue</li>
            <li>The yellow color and thick texture are important, even if they don&#x27;t look as pretty because it means it is 100% pure.  </li>
            <li>The yellow color and thick texture are important, even if they don&#x27;t look as pretty because it means it is 100% pure.  </li>
            <li>In fact, you may want to mix it with cheap body cream to make it easier to apply because a tiny bit of this goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent years paying top prices - like $50 for an 8 oz jar of Kiehls intensive Treatment and Moisturizer for Dry or Callused Areas.  </li>
            <li>We add different essential oils when we make a new batch for fun.</li>
            <li>BUT this stuff has such a STRONG ODOR of its own; I was unable to find any essential oil/s, which would mask its scent.</li>
            <li>Even when my son has an occasional pressure sore, I put this mixture around the area to keep it soft and pliable and I think it heals better without that tight and drawn up look.</li>
            <li>If this recipe turns out too hard, add more carrier oil to make it softer.  </li>
            <li>This product came in one extremely hard lump and was not even able to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It sits on the shelf with all my other \\&quot;meds,\\&quot; and is easy to refill whenever I&#x27;m running low.  </li>
            <li>Has been helping tremendously so far with those unsightly spots and definately keeps the skin moisturized.</li>
            <li>and so far it keeps my skin supple.</li>
            <li>And OLD at that.</li>
            <li>So far i have used it on my face (doing wonder)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s called Golden Shea Butter or African Shea, but it&#x27;s really from a totally different tree called Kpagnan or African Tallow tree.</li>
            <li>If you want real Shea, it will be of an ivory color, not white, because that means it&#x27;s been bleached.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for natural product, you will be delected.</li>
            <li>The color is much like a daffodil yellow.</li>
            <li>I purchase African Shea Butter from Ghana and i am very please with the product.  </li>
            <li>It is soft and bouncy with curls.  </li>
            <li>It has made my feet so soft.</li>
            <li>DURING THE DAY I JUST PUT THE SHEA BUTTER DIRECTLY</li>
            <li>THE PEOPLE WHO SELL THIS SHEA BUTTER IS SELLING NATURAL PRODUCTS.  </li>
            <li>IT IS NATURAL</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and shea butter can be used with no problem.  </li>
            <li>So far, two of the claims have been verified to work on my body:</li>
            <li>So far as I can tell it is what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and wanted to find an organic non fragrance moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Very think and gritty.</li>
            <li>this will last a super long time.</li>
            <li>have used this to make lotions at home by melting, adding some essential oils and then whipping to cool, but I think that this Shea has a very distinct smoky scent (not unpleasant, just there)that makes it difficult to discern the essential oils that I added.</li>
            <li>Beside the minor and common delivery issue I&#x27;m pleased!</li>
            <li>so no mess on the packaging.</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry skin and as an african american I don&#x27;t enjoy looking like ashy larry.</li>
            <li>while it can be used as-is, most products only contain a small fraction of the stuff.  </li>
            <li>&quot; or East African variety of shea butter and the plain off-white or Ivory West African variety for the better part of 6 years I have filtered between these three butters.</li>
            <li>I have used all natural shea butter before and this is definitely it.</li>
            <li>This scent is the same even with the so called \\&quot;real\\&quot; naturally colored ivory shea butters.</li>
            <li>As for the mustard yellow color, I compared Halaleveryday&#x27;s product with real imported African shea butter from different online websites (one of them is in this video), and they are all of that same color.</li>
            <li>raw shea butter (don&#x27;t get the whipped kind or mixed with other stuff) is natural, very emollient and a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>Naturally ivory colored shea butter and yellow ones do exist and it doesn&#x27;t have to be white.</li>
            <li>Last year I nearly passed away from what I later learned is the mother of all allergic reactions:  </li>
            <li>Shortly after receiving the product I was looking for different recipes online to make my own body butter and sadly discovered that what I had bought wasn&#x27;t Shea butter at all.</li>
            <li>Now I have a whole tub of this \\&quot;Shea\\&quot; butter that seems to have been diluted down or just processed whichever it is</li>
            <li>There were splinters on the surface of the shea butter due to the damaged container but carefully taking off a little off the top took care of that.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and dry skin and need the Shea Butter to keep my skin moisted.</li>
            <li>I use this for everything from dry skin, skin irritations, diaper rash for my babies (7 month old)</li>
            <li>I was luckier than most, because it is very often fatal, and can leave you blind and with other internal issues as well.  </li>
            <li>Real Shea butter will be a little more expensive than this stuff.</li>
            <li>You can make hard body butter with this recipe or a soft intense moisturizer depending on your needs.</li>

            <li> I went to a Japaneese merchant here and found a better grade of Shea Butter after I explained the condtions of the butter I purchased threw Amazon.</li>
            <li> So glad I tried this product and will continue with it.  </li>
            <li> and I would have lost most if not all of it.</li>
            <li> and i love</li>
            <li> and overall I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I bought two to be sure I always have it on hand.</li>
            <li> I simply love this one though.  </li>
            <li> I am more inclined to believe this is coco butter.</li>
            <li> I love this shea butter and use it in making moisture cream.  </li>
            <li> and I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Your skin will love it.</li>
            <li> I hope to verify the rest of the claims and find more uses for this butter.</li>
            <li> I love to use shea butter in my hair products and for my skin</li>
            <li> I have used it all and need to order more.</li>
            <li> Product seems authentic.</li>
            <li> We are able to use this for her scalp, her hair, and as a lotion.</li>
            <li> I am a licensed massage therapist who does mostly MFR.</li>
            <li> My patients also love how it makes their skin feel softer and more hydrated after a massage session.</li>
            <li> Okay.</li>
            <li> I have found that it keeps my hair better conditioned and my skin more supple.</li>
            <li> think it&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li> and although it is a softer butter, it is more grainy and in my opinion...</li>
            <li> love the purity of this product.</li>
            <li> Have used on many projects and love the results.</li>
            <li> Love this product is is everything they said it was.</li>
            <li> I wasnt sure about using on my face</li>
            <li> but I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> Sooooooo many uses.</li>
            <li> They should&lt;br /&gt;be packaged better.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I will be buying more.  </li>
            <li> Although the smell isn&#x27;t very nice, it&#x27;s very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful for those of us with dry skin!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still very good for your skin, comparable to Shea&#x27;s quality, but a different product.</li>
            <li> (primary reason why i bought it).Two birds with one stone:)</li>
            <li> , I have never purchased filtered \\&quot;raw\\&quot; Shea Butter before, I assumed because it is NATURAL, that it would be a &#x27;good thing&#x27; and make a healthy skin lotion.</li>
            <li> it.love how it melts quickly and almost \\&quot;odorless\\&quot; (VERY important for work environment).</li>
            <li> It is yellow and it is smoky, but if you read about it is simply becuase the colors vary, it is roasted over a fire, and it is unrefined, mine came in good timing, and is an excellent quality product.  </li>
            <li> We spoke and he was very nice over the phone and advised he would have a second container shipped to me for free and packaged much better.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t love the consistency, but if you rub between your hands to heat up and melt a bit before applying to your feet or body it works much better.</li>
            <li> I have also tried using it on my face after I read some reviews about it reducing the appearance of fine lines</li>
            <li> If one is creative enough, it can work successfully.</li>
            <li> Some people describe it as nutty, I think it smells more like a mild camp-fire smokey scent.  </li>
            <li> This has been super helpful for my psoriasis plaques!</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Melts in your hands and goes on smoothly providing improvement and comfort to the skin.  </li>
            <li> Almost forgot the smell is so light which is a plus.</li>
            <li> African Shea Butter work great for just about every thing.</li>
            <li> It soften your hair,takes the inch away from insect bites,leaves skin smooth on hands and feet.</li>
            <li> This is defintely a great product for the entire body.</li>
            <li> and then it is fabulous.</li>
            <li> AS SMOOTH AS BUTTER.  </li>
            <li> I thought that the yellow-gold \\&quot;raw\\&quot; Butter would be healthier than the sterilized/odor free Shea Butter</li>
            <li> so it is important to keep this product in the fridge.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> so I did some research and found that raw shea butter is the best for your skin.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty sure that I&#x27;m not buying from here again.  </li>
            <li> I ordered some and saw an amazing improvement of my overall skin tone in about 3 weeks but even better</li>
            <li> Great item to use all year round, wish it came in a better container thou mine cracked in shipment, but still usable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I was looking for a healthy product that I could scent with essential oil/s, whereby making my own lotion/s.  </li>
            <li> Great for dry skin &amp; making creams</li>
            <li> not as good for the skin as the West African variety.</li>
            <li> and it is not a bad smell either.</li>
            <li> This butter repairs skin but leaves it with an odd smell but nothing good perfume wont fix. :)</li>
            <li> Other than that it is great, but does have a smell, so I would spritz with perfume as I rubbed in my skin.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, should I choose to purchase this item again the shipping is just as quick as the 1st time.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, a definite staple in my daily beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> You only need a tiny amount and it does great stuff!</li>
            <li> Love the texture and it was more than enough to share.</li>
            <li> MIxed it with my essential oils for a wonderful lock in moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The product description was accurate and the shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to many of my massage therapist friends.</li>
            <li> Also, it is good for any minor skin irritations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on healthy skin, sunburned skin, skin that had a rash on it, skin that was SUPER dry and on my hair to help with friz and static.  </li>
            <li> My original shipment came in damaged however customer service was prompt and friendly and the seller not only replaced it but sent me an additional tub for free!</li>
            <li> The shea has a light oily oder that I don&#x27;t really care for, but it is mild.  </li>
            <li> I like having the large tub of it to use freely.</li>
            <li> Having said that, the product be very good as far as itself seems to the expected results go.</li>
            <li> Delivery took some time but so worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Had it been summer time when it came it would have surely melted and run completely out of the container</li>
            <li> The product was as good as i expected.</li>
            <li> Personally, I am not crazy about the smell at all, a bit too earthy for me..</li>
            <li> The moisturizing quality is nice, and I&#x27;m currently blending it with coconut oil and using it as a belly rub for my pregnancy to ward off stretch marks.</li>
            <li> So I added more oil, and more, and more..., until finally, I had added 1/2 oz of essential oil to the 2 oz of Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li> My only hope is that if you do choose to buy it, that you have better luck than I did, and that you enjoy it.</li>
            <li> This keeps it fresh.</li>
            <li> I bought this tub thinking that I would make my own facial moisturizer and hair conditioner.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s cheaper than what I normally pay, lesson learned--get what you pay for!!!</li>
            <li> Best SPF sunscreen protection there is, I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now, it has replaced other lotions I use to use, now I&#x27;m hooked on 100% African Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> Used it while I was pregnant with my first on my tummy</li>
            <li> The Nilotica is okay for creams and hair use, but as like everything else, experiment for yourself and find your own truth, I just had to comment here because I see too many people talking hot mess about a good shea butter and elevating Nilotica and other high end stuff that really ain&#x27;t even all of that.</li>
            <li> Apply it right after a shower</li>
            <li> THAT I BROUGHT MELTS RIGHT INTO MY HAIR.  </li>
            <li> THE PRICE IS RIGHT</li>
            <li> Product is soft and Easy to use started using more frequently.  </li>
            <li> and it works so much better than most of the other brands!</li>
            <li> this is great Shea Butter good price very creamy my only complaint</li>
            <li> my skin soft, great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> My only hope is that if you do choose to buy it, that you have better luck than I did, and that you enjoy it.xing so much in with the Shea Butter and using it on my skin, was not the wisest thing</li>
            <li> I have also found that if I heat the Shea gently in a double boiler, to a liquid state, then let it cool, all of the graininess is removed, and I am left with a nice smooth product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you hands are dry and skin is flaking of this will make them look nice and shiny.</li>
            <li> I let the mixture stand and cure for 72 hours, but when I opened the jar all I could smell was the Shea with a very light hint of the essential oil.</li>
            <li> I make my own lotion for my very dry skin and found this Shea Butter to be exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I bought this, didn&#x27;t know what exactly i was going to use it for.  </li>
            <li> Its a bit &#x27;grainy&#x27; feeling at first, but all of the grains melt away as soon as I start to rub it in.</li>
            <li> A pea sized amount is more than enough to thoroughly moisturize my hands and wrists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying filtered &amp; creamy Shea butter</li>
            <li> You can also find recipes online to whip the shea butter with your favorite essential oil and make it smell better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the complainers saying that \\&quot;It&#x27;s mustard yellow\\&quot; and that \\&quot;it should be white\\&quot; and it \\&quot;smells like ashes\\&quot; please research first before commenting.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying it.</li>
            <li> The smell is nauseating, very over bearing, and does not wear off!</li>
            <li> Thus I use it for my dog now when she is damp after baths to make her coat shiney and relieve hot spots.</li>
            <li> I have found that the African shea butter to be an outstanding product to use when doing myofascial techniques.</li>
            <li> and I really do feel like it makes my skin clearer and brighter!</li>
            <li> You have to work it very smooth for a long time.</li>
            <li> is the first time I have ever tried the pure shea butter</li>
            <li> anyway, I am willing to give this product 3 stars because it seemed OK when I used on my DRY skin.</li>
            <li> anyway, I am willing to give this product 3 stars because it seemed OK when I used on my DRY skin.</li>
            <li> Looking forward seing positive results  </li>
            <li> Easy enough</li>
            <li> I purchased this large container of what I thought was Shea butter.</li>
            <li> It leaves residue in the hair once it dries out, but that may be because it doesn&#x27;t blend well with certain products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried shea butter and other oils before, but this particular kind almost immediately made a difference.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Later, I made a rich, easy to slather on \\&quot;cream\\&quot; by blending olive oil with big chunks of shea butter in one of the small containers that came with my Magic Bullet.  </li>
            <li> I like the ivory just fine, but prefer the yellow</li>
            <li> It has a lot of vitamin E in it, too, apparently, along with a lot of other good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love my shea butter,I use it on my whole body,and my daughter who has dry skin softens it to the touch,It also helps my swollen feet ,I recommend this product it came right on time,and the price is well worth sending off for African Shea butter.</li>
            <li> I am sure my skin and my hair would have fallen to pieces by now if so, because I basically bathe in yellow shea butter from head to toe because the yellow is my own beauty secret and favorite variety.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin moisturizers when u put it on like the real Shea butter</li>
            <li> Product is better than expected.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve have several people ask me what is different about me, that I look more radiant and comment on my smooth, clear skin.  </li>

            <li> mo1N81MOQNXG9AJ]]Here is a video review of shea butter purchased from HalalEveryday vs. real shea butter from Back2Africa.</li>
            <li> From what I could tell, the one sold by HalalEveryday is indeed real shea butter.</li>
            <li> it becomes very creamy.   </li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was fast too</li>
            <li> Anyway, my hair isn&#x27;t greasy (who wants that)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even have a smell and shea butter is very odoriferous.</li>
            <li> This has been very helpful for my eczema.  </li>
            <li> No junk in it, just the real deal 100%.  </li>
            <li> , THEY HAD FAST SERVICE (because I was scare</li>
            <li> So mixing so much in with the Shea Butter and using it on my skin, was not the wisest thing</li>
            <li> It will emulsify and become a very creamy texture.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> I thought that melting it would make it much smoother to add the oils and essenses&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> in all, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product, the amount is generous and will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I used to use it in making my own lotions, but now I just use it raw and unmixed.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely mixed with something else as shea butter is not white or yellow its more of a beige/ivory and its smooth in texture.</li>
            <li> so i contacted seller prior to arrival date and got reply right away!</li>
            <li> but that I can also share with my husband, who is dark hair/eyes and more ruddy complexion.  </li>
            <li> The hype is true about African Shea butter.</li>
            <li> Even the Mayo Clinic concoctions weren&#x27;t that effective in such a short amount of time, but my Mayo doctors gave shea butter their blessing--SPF4, I believe they said it was, as a natural sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> This is a huge tub of it too, so I think I&#x27;m set for a long time!</li>
            <li> I have had other butters with more fatty sustance in it and it spread better.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this.</li>
            <li> So as far as buying this or product NOT, is up is certainly up to you.  </li>
            <li> So as far as buying this or product NOT, is up is certainly up to you.  </li>
            <li> I just love this pure Shea Butter, I use everyday, for hair and skin!</li>
            <li> I would have to warm up because it was really hard.</li>
            <li> I have been using golden or yellow shea butter off and on as well as the high end  \\&quot;Nilotica\\</li>
            <li> As a senior adult, my skin has lost elasticity and the shea butter really helps with that.</li>
            <li> but I still need a few more weeks to see results...</li>
            <li> The scent only lasts until the shea butter is absorbed into your skin.  </li>
            <li> I love this product, it keeps my hair moisturized and my skin soft and its also clearing up my dark spots.</li>
            <li> I tried so many different over the counter moisturizers and nothing worked until I went back to my old stand-by.</li>
            <li> I have tried other shea butters and they were fine.  </li>
            <li> but it is not like the natural Shea butter I normally get from Africa!</li>
            <li> I stir the mixture up really well then allow it to sit and cool off stirring occasionally over the next day or so.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like (but can live with):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Live and learn.</li>
            <li> (Very much like buying ten pounds of paprika at Costco.)  </li>
            <li> so your skin will be warm enough to melt the butter and it absolutely will fix any rough, dry, cracking skin problems.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for something natural, but long lasting and good for my skin because I was breaking out with almost every other moisturizer I used.  </li>
            <li> On its own it no good.</li>
            <li> I have a small Glad container that I put about a cup into and wrap up the rest and put it in the fridge.</li>
            <li> As far as quality I have no complaints!</li>
            <li> It stayed oily for a few minutes and gradually absorbed right in, leaving the skin soft and supple with no greasy after-feel.</li>
            <li> It can be difficult to put on if you don&#x27;t warm it up first.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s consistency is like putty, so it is very very hard to smooth into your skin unless you have very hot hands and rub them together, and even then it&#x27;s the consistency of glue</li>
            <li> The yellow color and thick texture are important, even if they don&#x27;t look as pretty because it means it is 100% pure.  </li>
            <li> The yellow color and thick texture are important, even if they don&#x27;t look as pretty because it means it is 100% pure.  </li>
            <li> In fact, you may want to mix it with cheap body cream to make it easier to apply because a tiny bit of this goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent years paying top prices - like $50 for an 8 oz jar of Kiehls intensive Treatment and Moisturizer for Dry or Callused Areas.  </li>
            <li> We add different essential oils when we make a new batch for fun.</li>
            <li> BUT this stuff has such a STRONG ODOR of its own; I was unable to find any essential oil/s, which would mask its scent.</li>
            <li> Even when my son has an occasional pressure sore, I put this mixture around the area to keep it soft and pliable and I think it heals better without that tight and drawn up look.</li>
            <li> If this recipe turns out too hard, add more carrier oil to make it softer.  </li>
            <li> This product came in one extremely hard lump and was not even able to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It sits on the shelf with all my other \\&quot;meds,\\&quot; and is easy to refill whenever I&#x27;m running low.  </li>
            <li> Has been helping tremendously so far with those unsightly spots and definately keeps the skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> and so far it keeps my skin supple.</li>
            <li> And OLD at that.</li>
            <li> So far i have used it on my face (doing wonder)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s called Golden Shea Butter or African Shea, but it&#x27;s really from a totally different tree called Kpagnan or African Tallow tree.</li>
            <li> If you want real Shea, it will be of an ivory color, not white, because that means it&#x27;s been bleached.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for natural product, you will be delected.</li>
            <li> The color is much like a daffodil yellow.</li>
            <li> I purchase African Shea Butter from Ghana and i am very please with the product.  </li>
            <li> It is soft and bouncy with curls.  </li>
            <li> It has made my feet so soft.</li>
            <li> DURING THE DAY I JUST PUT THE SHEA BUTTER DIRECTLY</li>
            <li> THE PEOPLE WHO SELL THIS SHEA BUTTER IS SELLING NATURAL PRODUCTS.  </li>
            <li> IT IS NATURAL</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and shea butter can be used with no problem.  </li>
            <li> So far, two of the claims have been verified to work on my body:</li>
            <li> So far as I can tell it is what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and wanted to find an organic non fragrance moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Very think and gritty.</li>
            <li> this will last a super long time.</li>
            <li> have used this to make lotions at home by melting, adding some essential oils and then whipping to cool, but I think that this Shea has a very distinct smoky scent (not unpleasant, just there)that makes it difficult to discern the essential oils that I added.</li>
            <li> Beside the minor and common delivery issue I&#x27;m pleased!</li>
            <li> so no mess on the packaging.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and as an african american I don&#x27;t enjoy looking like ashy larry.</li>
            <li> while it can be used as-is, most products only contain a small fraction of the stuff.  </li>
            <li> &quot; or East African variety of shea butter and the plain off-white or Ivory West African variety for the better part of 6 years I have filtered between these three butters.</li>
            <li> I have used all natural shea butter before and this is definitely it.</li>
            <li> This scent is the same even with the so called \\&quot;real\\&quot; naturally colored ivory shea butters.</li>
            <li> As for the mustard yellow color, I compared Halaleveryday&#x27;s product with real imported African shea butter from different online websites (one of them is in this video), and they are all of that same color.</li>
            <li> raw shea butter (don&#x27;t get the whipped kind or mixed with other stuff) is natural, very emollient and a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Naturally ivory colored shea butter and yellow ones do exist and it doesn&#x27;t have to be white.</li>
            <li> Last year I nearly passed away from what I later learned is the mother of all allergic reactions:  </li>
            <li> Shortly after receiving the product I was looking for different recipes online to make my own body butter and sadly discovered that what I had bought wasn&#x27;t Shea butter at all.</li>
            <li> Now I have a whole tub of this \\&quot;Shea\\&quot; butter that seems to have been diluted down or just processed whichever it is</li>
            <li> There were splinters on the surface of the shea butter due to the damaged container but carefully taking off a little off the top took care of that.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and dry skin and need the Shea Butter to keep my skin moisted.</li>
            <li> I use this for everything from dry skin, skin irritations, diaper rash for my babies (7 month old)</li>
            <li> I was luckier than most, because it is very often fatal, and can leave you blind and with other internal issues as well.  </li>
            <li> Real Shea butter will be a little more expensive than this stuff.</li>
            <li> You can make hard body butter with this recipe or a soft intense moisturizer depending on your needs.</li>
            <li> This yellow butter is the real deal in my opinion, but if you will do a little research, you will find that some village processors add to the butter the roots of the shea tree which impart the color and additional healing properties to the butter as well (to clear dark spot, treat blemishes, tone skin)</li>
            <li> This is a hard substance &amp; not easy to apply,  it&#x27;s old, at least mine was not soft at all,I bought diff kind of shea &amp; all kinds were oily &amp; soft</li>
            <li> , I personally find that just putting a small ball in my palms and rubbing them back and forth really fast warms it up enough to spread.  </li>
            <li> 32oz is a lot and in my opinion, a little goes a long way, so it will take quite a while to use up this much Shea Butter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> a tiny bit of this goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> I had trouble handling delicate fabrics without shredding them and now they are amazingly smooth.  </li>
            <li> may, or may NOT be bothered by the scent of this stuff; your only concern may be if it helps with DRY SKIN, which I think that it does.</li>

            <li> The white shea butter you see around is mixed with other things and won&#x27;t give you</li>
            <li> The white shea butter you see around is mixed with other things and won&#x27;t give you</li>
            <li> I have been using shea butter, white and yellow, for the past 6-7 years and have always gotten it the same consistency from local african shops.</li>
            <li> I tried SIX different oils, some alone and several I mixed together to get the right scent for me; sadly it did not accomplish what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This you have to really work hard to get it to start melting on your skin.</li>
            <li> (I was afraid to add much more because of the possibility of a skin reaction.)</li>
            <li> I received this a day earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> It will take you a long time to use it even if you slather yourself in it every day.  </li>
            <li> I will buy it again when this giant tub is empty.</li>
            <li> I prefer the yellow shea that is not as stiff and a bit creamier and this fit the bill, however, the container came and it was broken all to bits and cracked everywhere.</li>
            <li> Also a few other disadvantages: it gives my fair skin an ugly yellow jaundice tint, because it is a very yellow butter.</li>
            <li> Although this product is creamier than the originally hard natural Shea butter chunks, it&#x27;s still not creamy enough for me.</li>
            <li> So it must be doing something!a very long time.  </li>
            <li> That means that the 32oz size will go a very long way.  </li>
            <li> Since moving to Colorado my skin has been so dry</li>
            <li> For anyone with chronic dry skin, this is a must-have.</li>
            <li> , I shower and put this on my ends and let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who has dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> My son has MS and some of his medications dry out his skin.  </li>
            <li> I am a diabetic and it helps keep my feet and skin from being so dry.  </li>
            <li> Coconut oil mixed w/ facial moisturizer, jojoba oil, cocoa butter, just to name a few.</li>
            <li> I CAN NOT LIVE WITHOUT IT.  </li>
            <li> I use it especially on my legs and feet and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> (A little essential oil can go a long way.  </li>
            <li> The only issue I had with this product was the bottom was busted and this Texas heat melted the product slightly.</li>
            <li> And while the skin damage, which sometimes requires grafts as if you&#x27;d been burned by fire, was also less severe for me, there are some patches of skin still going through a series of symptoms that keep them irritated, itchy and constantly shedding and scabbing.  </li>
            <li> And some are quite strong and can cause skin issues, even be dangerous to use in excess.</li>
            <li> last one I bought came in a plastic bag which was very messy  from different vendor)</li>
            <li> My hands used to be so rough</li>
            <li> The nuts are cooked, crushed, and toasted (making ashes) which is why you&#x27;re smelling the ash scent.</li>
            <li> The African Shea Butter is one of the few creams that helps with my eczema.  </li>
            <li> but this product was not smooth enough for my liking.  </li>
            <li> I add a few drops of essential oil</li>
            <li> My rough patches began to soften and the strange almost vitiligo-like areas began to fill with pigment faster than they had previously.  </li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I use it as soon as I get out of the shower and on me it seems to sit on the surface of my skin for a few minutes because its thick but absorbs very well thereafter.</li>
            <li> I have been using shea butter for years and this is not pure 100% shea butter.</li>
            <li> In just one day after receiving and using my Shea Butter, the dark skin-color on my forearms have brightened; and my, somewhat, dry skin around my ankles have moistened.</li>
            <li> One, treatment of dry skin; two, treats dark spots, skin discolorations.    </li>
            <li> I gave this product 5 stars because it has no additives or preservatives and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This also has a lot of medicinal purposes for the skin, when using it,a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Remember it only takes a small quarter sized lump to cover face and neck and arms.</li>
            <li> You would need to cook something up with other oils etc.</li>
            <li> I thought that if I wore a small amount, the warmth of my skin might bring out the essential oil/s; it did NOT.</li>
            <li> and you can only do small areas at a time.</li>
            <li> But, the large package size is difficult to store and share with other family members.  </li>
            <li> I have stopped using conventional soaps and lotions.</li>
            <li> Not a liquid or a hard solid...</li>
            <li> You can see the flakes falling off when I try to scoop it out and rub it in my hand to melt it down.</li>
            <li> And the shea butter took care of it and no more dry spots.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t even apply it without making a mess.</li>
            <li> I dab a little around my eyes and mouth...</li>
            <li> Not only did my package come late and cracked, it&#x27;s cocoa butter and not shea butter!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews here, and was a little leery about ordering this product</li>
            <li> This company has poor shipping practices and do not send you a replacement if your container or product is damaged prior to you getting it.</li>
            <li> and I have not had to reapply after a few hours either.</li>
            <li> The product was shipped in a broken container and not fit for human use.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it is a bit stiff and flaky, but put a splotch of it on your hand, put your hands together and in a few seconds it is liquid luxury.  </li>
            <li> I use this and black soap from Ghana!</li>
            <li> The smell of raw shea butter is something you have to grow to tolerate or appreciate.  </li>
            <li> Bear in mind that this is the raw ingredient and</li>
            <li> I use both the raw unfiltered as well.</li>
            <li> This Shea Butter was a little on the hard side to get out of the container.</li>
            <li> I was too anxious to get my order</li>
            <li> so there is nothing sinister going on here just &#x27;cause the butter is yellow.</li>
            <li> But at least it was the correct product in the package.</li>
            <li> She is allergic to all artificial red dyes which are found in almost everything.</li>
            <li> I did opt to keep it as I was desperately in need of the Shea Butter for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> We have tried everything over the counter and from our dermatologist including steroidal creams, which are not good for you.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with it, and its not the company&#x27;s fault, is that shea butter really stinks!</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I do like the product, but both of the containers it came in were broken.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the consistency of it (real thick), so I pop it in the mircowave for a couple of seconds</li>
            <li> Someone failed to correct the problem before shipping it out.</li>
            <li> So difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> The shea butter is very tough, so I suggest melting it in a coffee mug for about a minute and making it a liquid.</li>
            <li> I should have purchased the ivory raw butter for the base of my hair products I make at home.  </li>
            <li> My skin is drier than the Sahara, and the soles of my feet have always been a cracked, painful nightmare.  </li>
            <li> This Shea Butter STINKS!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Some of the reviewers stated they were disappointed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to getting, completely disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very, very disappointed!!!!</li>
            <li> it was so nasty!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what this is but it is NOT Shea Butter.  I buy 100% Shea butter all the time from amazon and decided to change sellers because of this price.  You get what you pay for!!</li>
            <li> I bought this, didn&#x27;t know what exactly i was going to use it for.  Now I mix it with coconut oil and some Lavender Oil and put it all over my body.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and as an african american I don&#x27;t enjoy looking like ashy larry. This butter repairs skin but leaves it with an odd smell but nothing good perfume wont fix. :)</li>
            <li> Bought this product for use during my pregnancy. Has been helping tremendously so far with those unsightly spots and definately keeps the skin moisturized. May be too greasy for daytime, but excellent for bedtime use. Love it.</li>
            <li> This Shea Butter was a little on the hard side to get out of the container. I have had other butters with more fatty sustance in it and it spread better. This you have to really work hard to get it to start melting on your skin. I was not happy with this product. I went to a Japaneese merchant here and found a better grade of Shea Butter after I explained the condtions of the butter I purchased threw Amazon. I have sensitive skin and dry skin and need the Shea Butter to keep my skin moisted.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this product. Its a bit &#x27;grainy&#x27; feeling at first, but all of the grains melt away as soon as I start to rub it in. I have also found that if I heat the Shea gently in a double boiler, to a liquid state, then let it cool, all of the graininess is removed, and I am left with a nice smooth product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a tiny bit of this goes a very long way. A pea sized amount is more than enough to thoroughly moisturize my hands and wrists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this to make lotions at home by melting, adding some essential oils and then whipping to cool, but I think that this Shea has a very distinct smoky scent (not unpleasant, just there)that makes it difficult to discern the essential oils that I added.</li>
            <li> So glad I tried this product and will continue with it.  Melts in your hands and goes on smoothly providing improvement and comfort to the skin.  Relieves itching, provides moisture and promotes healing. No scent or fragrance added is a definite enjoyment.</li>
            <li> This is truly a great product. Its look like the picture. The texture is moist and creamy. I purchase this sheabutter because it came in a container last one I bought came in a plastic bag which was very messy  from different vendor) this will last a super long time. Great price dont know why shipping cost more than product. Package is good no cracks in container. Super happy with this product will buy again. Delivery took some time but so worth the wait. If your thinking about buying sheabutter please try this one. Almost forgot the smell is so light which is a plus. Try it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I received this a day earlier than expected. I opened the package and used this solid product by rubbing between my hands. Remember it only takes a small quarter sized lump to cover face and neck and arms. Use your judgement as to the rest of your body.  I recommend using this product undiluted for African American hair.  I also recommend making a salve with any carrier oil, organic beeswax and shea butter. You can make hard body butter with this recipe or a soft intense moisturizer depending on your needs. If this recipe turns out too hard, add more carrier oil to make it softer.  As to the smell, it smells just like cocoa butter so, like me, if you&#x27;re used to the smell of cocoa butter and like it, the smell is no problem. The smell goes away in about five minutes.  I gave this product 5 stars because it has no additives or preservatives and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Idk what&#x27;s in this product  but it is not like the natural Shea butter I normally get from Africa! It smells like vegetable oil and petroleum! When u scoop the product up to put it on it crumbles! You can&#x27;t even apply it without making a mess. The product isn&#x27;t unrefined, it&#x27;s been filtered and processed! It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin moisturizers when u put it on like the real Shea butter I&#x27;m used to getting, completely disappointed! Now I have a whole tub of this \\&quot;Shea\\&quot; butter that seems to have been diluted down or just processed whichever it is, it&#x27;s cheaper than what I normally pay, lesson learned--get what you pay for!!!</li>
            <li> I was sent a defective, rancid product and paid for it.  This merchant should not be allowed to sell their shea butter product.  Forget this merchant; it is a scam!  The product was shipped in a broken container and not fit for human use.  Very, very disappointed!!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this item for the 1st time on a Saturday and had it by Monday. Hopefully, should I choose to purchase this item again the shipping is just as quick as the 1st time. I&#x27;ve been using this shea butter for about a week and so far it keeps my skin supple. Like other reviewers, I use it as soon as I get out of the shower and on me it seems to sit on the surface of my skin for a few minutes because its thick but absorbs very well thereafter. Purpose of this buy was to even out blotchy skin areas but I still need a few more weeks to see results...</li>
            <li> I bought this product as a last effort to hydrate my skin. Since moving to Colorado my skin has been so dry and I needed to suppliment my beauty routine by adding additional moisturizers . I had tried everything, Coconut oil mixed w/ facial moisturizer, jojoba oil, cocoa butter, just to name a few. And the shea butter took care of it and no more dry spots. Also great to use as nipple butter for nursing moms!! Totally recommend!!</li>
            <li> The product itself was good. I prefer the yellow shea that is not as stiff and a bit creamier and this fit the bill, however, the container came and it was broken all to bits and cracked everywhere. Had it been summer time when it came it would have surely melted and run completely out of the container and I would have lost most if not all of it. I contacted the seller and was given his number to call him about it. We spoke and he was very nice over the phone and advised he would have a second container shipped to me for free and packaged much better. Well I got refund but NEVER got a replacement. I contacted him over a week after his promise and he claimed it was sent and I would get it soon. Almost 3 weeks have gone by and nothing. He is a liar and does not make good on his promises. I only got a refund because I went through Amazon and requested one. This company has poor shipping practices and do not send you a replacement if your container or product is damaged prior to you getting it. Won&#x27;t ever purchase from him again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what this stuff is but if I had to guess????  It smells like strained grease from frying. And OLD at that. This is NOT Shea butter. I threw it away it was so nasty!!!!</li>
            <li> The product was as good as i expected. I have used all natural shea butter before and this is definitely it.</li>
            <li> I was too anxious to get my order (African Shea Butter Filtered &amp; creamy)cuz felt like it took forever so i contacted seller prior to arrival date and got reply right away! weekend made the shipping longer.Item arrived next day as stated. Happy customer.who? me:)Product is AMAZING! 32oz packed nicely and in good condition(Hard &amp; cold-freezed in the way to MN) so no mess on the packaging. This is my first time buying filtered &amp; creamy Shea butter and i love it.love how it melts quickly and almost \\&quot;odorless\\&quot; (VERY important for work environment). So far i have used it on my face (doing wonder) soon I shall use to condition my hair (primary reason why i bought it).Two birds with one stone:) Committed customer I shall be my African sister/brother.Good business-Much luv &amp; success!!</li>
            <li> Shortly after receiving the product I was looking for different recipes online to make my own body butter and sadly discovered that what I had bought wasn&#x27;t Shea butter at all. It&#x27;s called Golden Shea Butter or African Shea, but it&#x27;s really from a totally different tree called Kpagnan or African Tallow tree. Real Shea butter will be a little more expensive than this stuff. It&#x27;s still very good for your skin, comparable to Shea&#x27;s quality, but a different product. Personally, I am not crazy about the smell at all, a bit too earthy for me..so I&#x27;m masking it with essential oils. So, I will not be purchasing this product again, because of the smell. The moisturizing quality is nice, and I&#x27;m currently blending it with coconut oil and using it as a belly rub for my pregnancy to ward off stretch marks. If you want real Shea, it will be of an ivory color, not white, because that means it&#x27;s been bleached.</li>
            <li> Product is better than expected.  Product is soft and Easy to use started using more frequently.  Looking forward seing positive results  Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I only learned of the value of shea butter last summer.  I was looking for something natural, but long lasting and good for my skin because I was breaking out with almost every other moisturizer I used.  My niece told me about shea butter so I did some research and found that raw shea butter is the best for your skin.  I ordered some and saw an amazing improvement of my overall skin tone in about 3 weeks but even better, I didn&#x27;t break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I like it:  raw shea butter (don&#x27;t get the whipped kind or mixed with other stuff) is natural, very emollient and a little bit goes a long way.  I&#x27;ve used it on healthy skin, sunburned skin, skin that had a rash on it, skin that was SUPER dry and on my hair to help with friz and static.  I&#x27;m a fair fair skinned red-head so you can imagine how thankful I am to have finally found something that works but that I can also share with my husband, who is dark hair/eyes and more ruddy complexion.  Our two daughters are bi-racial and shea butter does AMAZING things for their skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like (but can live with):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The smell of raw shea butter is something you have to grow to tolerate or appreciate.  Some people describe it as nutty, I think it smells more like a mild camp-fire smokey scent.  The scent only lasts until the shea butter is absorbed into your skin.  You can also find recipes online to whip the shea butter with your favorite essential oil and make it smell better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It can be difficult to put on if you don&#x27;t warm it up first.  The texture is similar to the wax pomade that you put on your hair to style it.  Some people microwave a bit before they rub it in, I personally find that just putting a small ball in my palms and rubbing them back and forth really fast warms it up enough to spread.  Again, if you whip it and keep it in a sealed, airtight container, it is easier to put on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product, the amount is generous and will last a very long time.  The yellow color and thick texture are important, even if they don&#x27;t look as pretty because it means it is 100% pure.  The white shea butter you see around is mixed with other things and won&#x27;t give you the same benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product, no matter what your skin type.  I&#x27;ve have several people ask me what is different about me, that I look more radiant and comment on my smooth, clear skin.  So it must be doing something!a very long time.

            <li> It is yellow and it is smoky, but if you read about it is simply becuase the colors vary, it is roasted over a fire, and it is unrefined, mine came in good timing, and is an excellent quality product.  I use shea butter in home made cosmetic recipes.. love it !!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product. This is the second tub I&#x27;ve ordered and it has arrived melted. The lid is not leak proof and it didn&#x27;t help that the tub was laying on it&#x27;s side. Shea Butter melts at 89 - 85 degrees.</li>
            <li> African Shea Butter work great for just about every thing. It soften your hair,takes the inch away from insect bites,leaves skin smooth on hands and feet.</li>
            <li> This is the fundamental ingredient in all the \\&quot;with Shea Butter\\&quot; products on the market.  Bear in mind that this is the raw ingredient and while it can be used as-is, most products only contain a small fraction of the stuff.  In fact, you may want to mix it with cheap body cream to make it easier to apply because a tiny bit of this goes a very long way.  That means that the 32oz size will go a very long way.  (Very much like buying ten pounds of paprika at Costco.)  It will take you a long time to use it even if you slather yourself in it every day.  The product works marvelously well.  Apply it right after a shower so your skin will be warm enough to melt the butter and it absolutely will fix any rough, dry, cracking skin problems.  My hands used to be so rough I had trouble handling delicate fabrics without shredding them and now they are amazingly smooth.  For anyone with chronic dry skin, this is a must-have.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1N81MOQNXG9AJ]]Here is a video review of shea butter purchased from HalalEveryday vs. real shea butter from Back2Africa. From what I could tell, the one sold by HalalEveryday is indeed real shea butter. For the complainers saying that \\&quot;It&#x27;s mustard yellow\\&quot; and that \\&quot;it should be white\\&quot; and it \\&quot;smells like ashes\\&quot; please research first before commenting. White shea butter is refined, meaning it has been stripped of its color and scent (along with its healing nutrients) with steam and bleaching chemicals. Naturally ivory colored shea butter and yellow ones do exist and it doesn&#x27;t have to be white. As for it smelling like ashes, if you go to L&#x27;Occitane&#x27;s website for Shea Butter, there&#x27;s a video there you can watch showing you how shea butter is made from the nuts. The nuts are cooked, crushed, and toasted (making ashes) which is why you&#x27;re smelling the ash scent. This scent is the same even with the so called \\&quot;real\\&quot; naturally colored ivory shea butters. As for the mustard yellow color, I compared Halaleveryday&#x27;s product with real imported African shea butter from different online websites (one of them is in this video), and they are all of that same color.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my wife and she was very satisfied. If you are looking for natural product, you will be delected. The product description was accurate and the shipping was very fast. I had no issue with the service.</li>
            <li> The African Shea Butter is one of the few creams that helps with my eczema.  Rub in very well and you good to go!  Twice a day, whether you feel like it or not.  Helps prevent future problems and helps keep my skin in one piece!</li>
            <li> Grab a handful and rub your palms together-- it becomes very creamy.   Wonderful for those of us with dry skin!</li>
            <li> I like the product a lot.  I use it on my face and I believe it helps reduce the effects of fine lines around the eyes and lips!! It heals blemishes as well.</li>
            <li> Great item to use all year round, wish it came in a better container thou mine cracked in shipment, but still usable.</li>
            <li> This has been super helpful for my psoriasis plaques! I HIGHLY recommend this. I have stopped using conventional soaps and lotions. I use this and black soap from Ghana! I got my sister on it as well who has eczema! It is AWESOME for sunburns too! I dab a little around my eyes and mouth...wrinkles gone! Of course this is with a diet change, but I recommend it for sure!!!</li>
            <li> The container was damaged in two places like it was dropped on the floor but there were no damages to the box it was shipped in. Someone failed to correct the problem before shipping it out. I did opt to keep it as I was desperately in need of the Shea Butter for my dry skin. There were splinters on the surface of the shea butter due to the damaged container but carefully taking off a little off the top took care of that.&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I have ever tried the pure shea butter so I do not have anything to compare it to. Having said that, the product be very good as far as itself seems to the expected results go. There is a nutty smell that goes away after a while once applied but it&#x27;s not an over-powering smell and it is not a bad smell either. The color is much like a daffodil yellow. It is solidified like playdoh but once I rubbed it between my palms it warmed up and softened/melted nicely making for easy application. It seemeds to be very effective as soon as I applied it on my skin. I don&#x27;t feel that dryness as with store bought lotions that I have been using and I have not had to reapply after a few hours either.It stayed oily for a few minutes and gradually absorbed right in, leaving the skin soft and supple with no greasy after-feel. 32oz is a lot and in my opinion, a little goes a long way, so it will take quite a while to use up this much Shea Butter.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast too and overall I am very happy with the product. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> As a senior adult, my skin has lost elasticity and the shea butter really helps with that. Also, it is good for any minor skin irritations. I like having the large tub of it to use freely. I bought two to be sure I always have it on hand.</li>
            <li> I purchase African Shea Butter from Ghana and i am very please with the product.  I was so impress with it that I sent some to my mother.      I apply it to my hair, scalpand , as to my body.  i have received several compliments about my hair.  They thought I had gone to the beauty salon, but it was the shea butter.  My hair even holds the style a lot longer with having to roll my hair everynight.  This is defintely a great product for the entire body.</li>
            <li> Yay for this.  I have tried other shea butters and they were fine.  I simply love this one though.  I don&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s the texture or the smell.  Anyway, my hair isn&#x27;t greasy (who wants that) It is soft and bouncy with curls.  That simply complements my routine.  Easy enough, I shower and put this on my ends and let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!! IT IS NOT SHEA BUTTER I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE HELL IT IS BUT IT LOOKS NOTHING LIKE SHEA BUTTER IT SMELLS GROSS ...LIKE... CHEMICALS AND IT&#x27;S JUST A BIG NO-NO! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT PEOPLE PLEASE I THREW MINE AWAY AND ORDERED SOME FROM TONYA TKOSKIN WHICH DOES WONDERS FOR YOU</li>
            <li> The package was labelled 32 oz. but the package was a 16oz. container.  Therefore I paid for 32 oz and got 16 oz.  But at least it was the correct product in the package.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I discovered this butter for my skin.  It is a must have and I will definately keep this in stock!</li>
            <li> I have been using shea butter for years and this is not pure 100% shea butter. It is definitely mixed with something else as shea butter is not white or yellow its more of a beige/ivory and its smooth in texture. When I take this out is like clay dough and it actually flakes!! You can see the flakes falling off when I try to scoop it out and rub it in my hand to melt it down. It might be 100% some type of butter but its not just shea butter. Definitely refined. It doesn&#x27;t even have a smell and shea butter is very odoriferous. Do your research and know what you are buying. sheainstitute check it out</li>
            <li> This stuff really is amazing. It has made my feet so soft. At first I didn&#x27;t love the consistency, but if you rub between your hands to heat up and melt a bit before applying to your feet or body it works much better.</li>
            <li> I purchased this large container of what I thought was Shea butter. I am more inclined to believe this is coco butter. I will continue to use it because I like coco butter also.</li>
            <li> This has been very helpful for my eczema.  It absorbs well without being greasy.  I used to use it in making my own lotions, but now I just use it raw and unmixed.  Great product</li>
            <li> Helped cure my keratosis pilaris when Eczema Helper essential oil by Plant Therapy was added into it. Also helped my husbands eczema when nothing else did the trick</li>
            <li> I love this shea butter and use it in making moisture cream.  My family loves it too.  It mixes well with cocoa butter and essential oils.  I would recommend this to anyone who has dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using shea butter for my hair and body for 3 years now and I love this product. I don&#x27;t care for the consistency of it (real thick), so I pop it in the mircowave for a couple of seconds and then it is fabulous. Not a liquid or a hard solid...perfect. I will be ordering this product again.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use both the raw unfiltered as well. This one will melt quicker so you can apply and go. Your skin will love it. Excellect value and great quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this from Amazon many months ago (2012) and it is awesome.  No junk in it, just the real deal 100%.  Yes, it is a bit stiff and flaky, but put a splotch of it on your hand, put your hands together and in a few seconds it is liquid luxury.  I will buy it again when this giant tub is empty.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shea butter! I am at a point where I can&#x27;t do without it. I have dry skin and this is the only moisturizer I use and it lasts all day. I use it especially on my legs and feet and a little goes a long way. It keeps my skin supple and smooth and I love wearing skirts without pantyhose because my legs look so good. This is a wonderful product, a definite staple in my daily beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item in hopes of using it on my hair, this was a mistake.  It just didn&#x27;t work out for me. Now I am stuck with all of this butter and don&#x27;t know what to do with it. I should have purchased the ivory raw butter for the base of my hair products I make at home.  So this product is NOT for hair in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I BROUGHT THIS SHEA BUTTER AND IT IS WONDERFUL.  IT KEEPS MY SKIN AS SMOOTH AS BUTTER.  PEOPLE ALWAYS TELL ME I HAVE BEAUTIFUL SKIN.  I AM OVER 60 AND THEY THINK I AM LYING.  THIS SHEAS BUTTER GOES ON NICE AND EASY.  I HAVE LOCS AND THE SHEA BUTTER THAT I BROUGHT MELTS RIGHT INTO MY HAIR.  AT NIGHT I MIX THE SHEA BUTTER WITH BABY OIL FOR EXTRA MOISTURE. DURING THE DAY I JUST PUT THE SHEA BUTTER DIRECTLY ON MY SKIN AND IT IS WONDERFUL.  WHOEVER SAYS THIS SHEA BUTTER IS NOT  WORKING.  I CAN NOT AGREE.  I CAN NOT LIVE WITHOUT IT.  THE PEOPLE WHO SELL THIS SHEA BUTTER IS SELLING NATURAL PRODUCTS.  THE PRICE IS RIGHT, THEY HAD FAST SERVICE (because I was scare I was going to run out but they delivered the product faster than I thought) IT IS NATURAL WHO EVER DOES NOT AGREE DOES NOT KNOW WHAT SHEA BUTTER IS.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it keeps my hair moisturized and my skin soft and its also clearing up my dark spots.</li>
            <li> If you want your hands to be greasy, this will do the job. If you hands are dry and skin is flaking of this will make them look nice and shiny. However, this product does not have healing properties. You would need to cook something up with other oils etc. On its own it no good.</li>
            <li> I used to put on my skin after shower. I would have to warm up because it was really hard. Other than that it is great, but does have a smell, so I would spritz with perfume as I rubbed in my skin.</li>
            <li> Not only did my package come late and cracked, it&#x27;s cocoa butter and not shea butter! I have been using shea butter, white and yellow, for the past 6-7 years and have always gotten it the same consistency from local african shops. This stuff smells like Palmer&#x27;s!! It should have an unfamiliar nutty scent to it, no traces of chocolate. I didn&#x27;t even bother using it, this is being returned!</li>
            <li> I love this Shea Butter! I use it in soap, massage oil, scrubs, and will be doing more soon! You only need a tiny amount and it does great stuff! This is a huge tub of it too, so I think I&#x27;m set for a long time!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and shea butter can be used with no problem.  It&#x27;s a great moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;keeps my skin soft, great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Quality product. Used it while I was pregnant with my first on my tummy and I have no stretch marks today. You get a lot for the price</li>
            <li> This Shea Butter STINKS!  My error, I have never purchased filtered \\&quot;raw\\&quot; Shea Butter before, I assumed because it is NATURAL, that it would be a &#x27;good thing&#x27; and make a healthy skin lotion. I thought that the yellow-gold \\&quot;raw\\&quot; Butter would be healthier than the sterilized/odor free Shea Butter so that is what I bought. In retrospect, I probably should have bought the white Shea Butter because the odor is removed.  My understanding was that this yellow-gold product would have kind of nutty scent, but it does not smell NUTTY to me, it just stinks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I was looking for a healthy product that I could scent with essential oil/s, whereby making my own lotion/s.  BUT this stuff has such a STRONG ODOR of its own; I was unable to find any essential oil/s, which would mask its scent. It has such an overpowering odor, that it overpowered any essential oil that I mixed with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In total I tried SIX different oils, some alone and several I mixed together to get the right scent for me; sadly it did not accomplish what I wanted. My recipe called for 6-10 drops of essential oil/s per each 1 oz of Shea Butter.  I started by adding 20 drops of essential oil into 2 oz of Shea Butter; but even with the maximum oil mixture as suggested by the recipe, all I could smell was the scent of the Shea Butter. So I added more oil, and more, and more..., until finally, I had added 1/2 oz of essential oil to the 2 oz of Shea Butter.  (I was afraid to add much more because of the possibility of a skin reaction.) I let the mixture stand and cure for 72 hours, but when I opened the jar all I could smell was the Shea with a very light hint of the essential oil. I thought that if I wore a small amount, the warmth of my skin might bring out the essential oil/s; it did NOT. In fact, it made my skin itch because of the excess essential oil.  (A little essential oil can go a long way.  And some are quite strong and can cause skin issues, even be dangerous to use in excess. So mixing so much in with the Shea Butter and using it on my skin, was not the wisest thing I ever done.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So anyway, I am willing to give this product 3 stars because it seemed OK when I used on my DRY skin. BUT would I use it again? NO!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may, or may NOT be bothered by the scent of this stuff; your only concern may be if it helps with DRY SKIN, which I think that it does. So as far as buying this or product NOT, is up is certainly up to you.  My only hope is that if you do choose to buy it, that you have better luck than I did, and that you enjoy it.xing so much in with the Shea Butter and using it on my skin, was not the wisest thing I ever done.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So anyway, I am willing to give this product 3 stars because it seemed OK when I used on my DRY skin.

            <li> I love my shea butter,I use it on my whole body,and my daughter who has dry skin softens it to the touch,It also helps my swollen feet ,I recommend this product it came right on time,and the price is well worth sending off for African Shea butter. Thanks,I reccomend buying from this seller again.</li>
            <li> 32OZ. AFRICAN SHEA BUTTER FROM GHANA FILTERED &amp; CREAMY&lt;br /&gt;Very nice skin product. Exactly what I was looking for. Great.</li>
            <li> The hype is true about African Shea butter. In just one day after receiving and using my Shea Butter, the dark skin-color on my forearms have brightened; and my, somewhat, dry skin around my ankles have moistened. So far, two of the claims have been verified to work on my body: One, treatment of dry skin; two, treats dark spots, skin discolorations.    I hope to verify the rest of the claims and find more uses for this butter. Who knows, maybe I can cook with it.</li>
            <li> This also has a lot of medicinal purposes for the skin, when using it,a little goes a long way. Best SPF sunscreen protection there is, I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now, it has replaced other lotions I use to use, now I&#x27;m hooked on 100% African Shea Butter. I also have used 100% Shea Butter Soap, also by DuDu Osun, it&#x27;s great also!!</li>
            <li> This product was way too gritty for me.  I love to use shea butter in my hair products and for my skin but this product was not smooth enough for my liking.  I would not purchase this again.  If you don&#x27;t mind gritty,then go for it.</li>
            <li> I use this for making homemade soap. This is a great product! I have used it all and need to order more.</li>
            <li> The product is good and does what it is supposed to do.  But, the large package size is difficult to store and share with other family members.  I have switched to the same suppliers pack of 3-16oz version - easier to store and share.</li>
            <li> Product seems authentic. Came undamaged, and putty like. The only problem I have with it, and its not the company&#x27;s fault, is that shea butter really stinks! This is my first time trying it. The smell is nauseating, very over bearing, and does not wear off! People in public notice! Its like a burnt roadkill smell, &amp; bothers my asthma. Also a few other disadvantages: it gives my fair skin an ugly yellow jaundice tint, because it is a very yellow butter. It&#x27;s consistency is like putty, so it is very very hard to smooth into your skin unless you have very hot hands and rub them together, and even then it&#x27;s the consistency of glue and you can only do small areas at a time. As for my hair, it was a disaster on my hair, like glue! Thus I use it for my dog now when she is damp after baths to make her coat shiney and relieve hot spots.</li>
            <li> I make my own lotion for my very dry skin and found this Shea Butter to be exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I have been making a skin cream from shea butter, olive oil, tea tree oil and grapeseed oil for my daughter with psoriasis. We add different essential oils when we make a new batch for fun. She is allergic to all artificial red dyes which are found in almost everything.This is the ONLY thing that has helped her. We have tried everything over the counter and from our dermatologist including steroidal creams, which are not good for you.We are able to use this for her scalp, her hair, and as a lotion.I have even used it for my face and it actually lessened the wrinkles around my eyes and my mouth! Shea butter is a Godsend.</li>
            <li> I am a licensed massage therapist who does mostly MFR. I have found that the African shea butter to be an outstanding product to use when doing myofascial techniques. My patients also love how it makes their skin feel softer and more hydrated after a massage session.I highly recommend this to many of my massage therapist friends.</li>
            <li> I just love this pure Shea Butter, I use everyday, for hair and skin! The only issue I had with this product was the bottom was busted and this Texas heat melted the product slightly. Beside the minor and common delivery issue I&#x27;m pleased!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even want to think about what my skin would look like if I did not use this. My son has MS and some of his medications dry out his skin.  I tried so many different over the counter moisturizers and nothing worked until I went back to my old stand-by. I made a mixture of equal parts by weight of shea butter, almond oil and apricot oil. I heat all three up in the microwave just until the shea butter melts. I stir the mixture up really well then allow it to sit and cool off stirring occasionally over the next day or so. It will emulsify and become a very creamy texture. This mixture has my son&#x27;s skin looking so wonderful that his doctors have asked what I put on his skin because his skin looks so healthy. Even when my son has an occasional pressure sore, I put this mixture around the area to keep it soft and pliable and I think it heals better without that tight and drawn up look. You can also put this mixture on your scalp it helps stop itching and flaking. Shea butter will go rancid so it is important to keep this product in the fridge. I have a small Glad container that I put about a cup into and wrap up the rest and put it in the fridge. This keeps it fresh.</li>
            <li> Okay. I have been using golden or yellow shea butter off and on as well as the high end  \\&quot;Nilotica\\&quot; or East African variety of shea butter and the plain off-white or Ivory West African variety for the better part of 6 years I have filtered between these three butters. This yellow butter is the real deal in my opinion, but if you will do a little research, you will find that some village processors add to the butter the roots of the shea tree which impart the color and additional healing properties to the butter as well (to clear dark spot, treat blemishes, tone skin) so there is nothing sinister going on here just &#x27;cause the butter is yellow. I am sure my skin and my hair would have fallen to pieces by now if so, because I basically bathe in yellow shea butter from head to toe because the yellow is my own beauty secret and favorite variety. I have found that it keeps my hair better conditioned and my skin more supple. I like the ivory just fine, but prefer the yellow because *I* think it&#x27;s better. I bought the Nilotica (East African) butter and although it is a softer butter, it is more grainy and in my opinion...not as good for the skin as the West African variety. The Nilotica is okay for creams and hair use, but as like everything else, experiment for yourself and find your own truth, I just had to comment here because I see too many people talking hot mess about a good shea butter and elevating Nilotica and other high end stuff that really ain&#x27;t even all of that. Live and learn. Gotta question the motives of some folks...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and unrefined shea butter has a distinctive smoky, nutty scent and this HAS it. It&#x27;s undeniably shea butter.</li>
            <li> this is great Shea Butter good price very creamy my only complaint I would like to know how its sourced, is it from a co-op that&#x27;s fair trade ect. These are things I care about. As far as quality I have no complaints!</li>
            <li> My skin is drier than the Sahara, and the soles of my feet have always been a cracked, painful nightmare.  I&#x27;ve spent years paying top prices - like $50 for an 8 oz jar of Kiehls intensive Treatment and Moisturizer for Dry or Callused Areas.  Nothing can beat this for effectiveness of price.  I add a few drops of essential oil (I prefer ylang ylang) to a tablespoon on this shea butter, microwave it for 1 minute, and slather it on head to toe.  My massage therapist now uses this same preparation for our session.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I bought this tub thinking that I would make my own facial moisturizer and hair conditioner.  So far as I can tell it is what I was looking for.  The shea has a light oily oder that I don&#x27;t really care for, but it is mild.  It seems to be a great value for the amount of shea I got and for the amount of  body products I can make with it. So far so good.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and wanted to find an organic non fragrance moisturizer. This works wonders for eczema as well! Beats any steroid cream or whatever prescribed by the Doctors! I have also tried using it on my face after I read some reviews about it reducing the appearance of fine lines and I really do feel like it makes my skin clearer and brighter! I use this for everything from dry skin, skin irritations, diaper rash for my babies (7 month old) and it works so much better than most of the other brands! I even got my husband to put it on the bottom of his feet and it has done an amazing job smoothing and moisturizing his feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLUS this HUGE 32 oz tub was so inexpensive! What a great deal! My original shipment came in damaged however customer service was prompt and friendly and the seller not only replaced it but sent me an additional tub for free! That sure made my week! Highly recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> I use this shea butter to make a cream for my hair that I use on a daily basis.  I haven&#x27;t found shea butter anywhere else for this price.</li>
            <li> This product came in one extremely hard lump and was not even able to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definetly would not suggest buying.</li>
            <li> this did not melt like Shea butter  or melt like Shea butter. I made the whip any way thinking that I  was just tripping,  but I&#x27;m pretty sure that I&#x27;m not buying from here again.  this was greasy and did not melt well at all.  I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> love the purity of this product. Have used on many projects and love the results. Great for dry skin &amp; making creams</li>
            <li> Love this product is is everything they said it was. Love the texture and it was more than enough to share. It makes my skin feel great I wasnt sure about using on my face but I did and it didnt clog any pores this is the bomb. Will order again</li>
            <li> Its a steal just what I ordered. Received the Shea butter &amp; started using it from head to toe.will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Although the smell isn&#x27;t very nice, it&#x27;s very moisturizing.  It&#x27;s fading my stretch marks and helping out my eczema.  The shea butter is very tough, so I suggest melting it in a coffee mug for about a minute and making it a liquid.</li>
            <li> This was so gritty, wished I knew before I added ingredients. You have to work it very smooth for a long time. So difficult to work with. I thought that melting it would make it much smoother to add the oils and essenses&#x27;s. Very think and gritty. Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Last year I nearly passed away from what I later learned is the mother of all allergic reactions:  Stevens Johnson syndrome.  I was luckier than most, because it is very often fatal, and can leave you blind and with other internal issues as well.  And while the skin damage, which sometimes requires grafts as if you&#x27;d been burned by fire, was also less severe for me, there are some patches of skin still going through a series of symptoms that keep them irritated, itchy and constantly shedding and scabbing.  I&#x27;d tried shea butter and other oils before, but this particular kind almost immediately made a difference.  My rough patches began to soften and the strange almost vitiligo-like areas began to fill with pigment faster than they had previously.  Even the Mayo Clinic concoctions weren&#x27;t that effective in such a short amount of time, but my Mayo doctors gave shea butter their blessing--SPF4, I believe they said it was, as a natural sunscreen.  It has a lot of vitamin E in it, too, apparently, along with a lot of other good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later, I made a rich, easy to slather on \\&quot;cream\\&quot; by blending olive oil with big chunks of shea butter in one of the small containers that came with my Magic Bullet.  It sits on the shelf with all my other \\&quot;meds,\\&quot; and is easy to refill whenever I&#x27;m running low.  But creamy or chunky...this is a miracle balm that I recommend with the utmost sincerity.  It has made a huge difference in my life!</li>
            <li> The shea butter that I always use was out of stock.  I read the reviews here, and was a little leery about ordering this product but I am glad I did. Some of the reviewers stated they were disappointed but I was not.  It is creamy and worked great in my body butter that I make. It has a short melt time over low heat which helps retain all it&#x27;s great qualities.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t leave without it.  It clears blemishes on my face, i use it when I&#x27;m tanning, as a hair oil etc. Sooooooo many uses.</li>
            <li> MIxed it with my essential oils for a wonderful lock in moisturizer. A bit grainy but rubs in well and the grain melts and disappears.</li>
            <li> I do like the product, but both of the containers it came in were broken. They should&lt;br /&gt;be packaged better.</li>
            <li> This is a hard substance &amp; not easy to apply,  it&#x27;s old, at least mine was not soft at all,I bought diff kind of shea &amp; all kinds were oily &amp; soft but this wasn&#x27;t, I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> When I received my package in the mail and opened my box I was in shock. It was nicely package. They gave you what you seen in the picture on-line. I was happy I will order this product again.</li>
            <li> Although this product is creamier than the originally hard natural Shea butter chunks, it&#x27;s still not creamy enough for me. It leaves residue in the hair once it dries out, but that may be because it doesn&#x27;t blend well with certain products. I can make great use of it by re-mixing it myself, then I believe it would work better for me. I haven&#x27;t tried it yet but when I do, may do another review on how that mixture works. Sometimes when on a budget, got to work with what you got. If one is creative enough, it can work successfully. I paid the money for this to work and work is what it&#x27;s gong to do.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I will be buying more.  I am a diabetic and it helps keep my feet and skin from being so dry.  I also mix it with almond oil and the argan oil for my hand and face.</li>
