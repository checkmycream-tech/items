            <li>lol  </li>
            <li>All I know is that people including my dermatologist, say I have great skin.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>This product is very nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product did come in good condition.</li>
            <li>Feels good on skin but no wrinkle reduction.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so much better!</li>
            <li>I may order a few more, wonderful ingredients makes skin feel so good !</li>
            <li>Neither were effective and the device is cheaply made and does not turn off unless the battery is removed.</li>
            <li>It Also works with another machine Ive purchased which costvmuch more, but it works on both.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Love how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li>The serum is easy to apply, and the quality is there.</li>
            <li>This pairs well with the Zeno line reducing light, it makes it glide easier and absorbs quite well.</li>
            <li>I use the serum with the Zeno machine and it makes the skin feel so smooth.  </li>
            <li>This stuff isn&#x27;t anything special</li>
            <li>Good basic skin care serum, at a steal of a price.  </li>
            <li>Really helps to relax fine lines on your face.</li>
            <li>and you will see the huge benefits that red light has on wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I think you can do a lot better for skin care with Oil of Olay or similar product.</li>
            <li>But it certainly has improved my skin from what it had been.</li>
            <li>Red Light &amp; heat to absorb this serum from the device is the main ingredient!</li>
            <li>Google \\&quot;RED LIGHT for anti-aging\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The warmth of the heat is very soothing around the eyes &amp; sinus areas.</li>
            <li>Does not work very well, but</li>
            <li>This product works very well with the Zeno machine.</li>
            <li>The cream itself is light and moisturizes well enough.</li>
            <li>Really like the Zeno.  </li>
            <li>The ZENO is the main cure for the wrinkles.</li>
            <li>as stated about red light, that is how long it takes to work.  </li>
            <li>My Zeno Line Rewind Never functioned properly but the serum worked very well moisturizing, softening and plumping my skin.</li>
            <li>i have sensitive skin and product dose not seem to cause break outs,</li>
            <li>As for the getting rid of wrinkles I am not sure, wrinkles are a part of who we are! :)</li>
            <li>I am not sure if it really helps the lines as I don&#x27;t have many, but what I do like about it is the soothing heat that it gives off when my eyes are tired and</li>

            <li> Unless you use the hand held ZENO device, don&#x27;t expect just the serum ALONE to work lol  The ZENO is the main cure for the wrinkles. Red Light &amp; heat to absorb this serum from the device is the main ingredient! I use the serum and my ZENO everyday for a half hour. Google \\&quot;RED LIGHT for anti-aging\\&quot; and you will see the huge benefits that red light has on wrinkles. I haven&#x27;t used mine long enuff to tell you my results but patience and consistancy is key! There is no overnight miracle for wrinkles!  i&#x27;m giving this at LEAST 3 months to see results, as stated about red light, that is how long it takes to work.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> Not sure it removes wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I saw this on the Dr. Oz show and thought it to be something I would like to try for lines around the eyes. I am not sure if it really helps the lines as I don&#x27;t have many, but what I do like about it is the soothing heat that it gives off when my eyes are tired and or I have sinus headaches. The warmth of the heat is very soothing around the eyes &amp; sinus areas. As for the getting rid of wrinkles I am not sure, wrinkles are a part of who we are! :)&lt;br /&gt;The product did come in good condition.</li>
            <li> I like this product. I am allergic to the sun and did not get the proper diagnosis  for several years. This product has helped to repair some of the damage to my skin from the sun. It&#x27;s not a miracle product. It can&#x27;t erase everything. But it certainly has improved my skin from what it had been.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom. She loves it! I ordered a second one so she can use it with the wrinkle reduction kit.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Zeno Line Rewind Wrinkle Reduction Treatment Serum 03/20/2011, and I have not seen any inprovement in the texture of my skin.  I will not purchase the product again.</li>
            <li> Does not work very well, but I guess you get what you pay for.  I&#x27;ll stick with Oil of Olay.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product about 6 months now along with my regular skincare routine. All I know is that people including my dermatologist, say I have great skin.</li>
            <li> This product is very nice. It does not take up a lot of time at night to use. My skin feels so much better!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now and haven&#x27;t seen any diffrence yet. Will keep using it since it does not make any harm to my face.</li>
            <li> Good basic skin care serum, at a steal of a price.  I may order a few more, wonderful ingredients makes skin feel so good !</li>
            <li> Purchased this with the LED device meant to improve the performance of the serum.  Neither were effective and the device is cheaply made and does not turn off unless the battery is removed.</li>
            <li> You never really know if a product works or not, especially when it comes to wrinkle reduction. The serum is easy to apply, and the quality is there. It&#x27;s an individual decision.</li>
            <li> I use this every day. Really helps to relax fine lines on your face. Love how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li> This pairs well with the Zeno line reducing light, it makes it glide easier and absorbs quite well. Are the changes dramatic? I wouldn&#x27;t say so, but this is not surgery and the price does not brake your budget.</li>
            <li> This product works very well with the Zeno machine. It Also works with another machine Ive purchased which costvmuch more, but it works on both.</li>
            <li> Feels good on skin but no wrinkle reduction.</li>
            <li> My Zeno Line Rewind Never functioned properly but the serum worked very well moisturizing, softening and plumping my skin. I&#x27;ve repurchased the serum a few times. It comes in a tube that travels well. I still have wrinkles though.</li>
            <li> Zeno Line Rewind goes with the little machine that promises to reduce your wrinkles. It doesn&#x27;t. The cream itself is light and moisturizes well enough. I think you can do a lot better for skin care with Oil of Olay or similar product. This stuff isn&#x27;t anything special</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Zeno for a few months now, and I definetly see improvement in my skin.  The skin around my jawline is tighter now than when I first began using the small masager with the cream.  I&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> skin dose feel tighter and small lines have disappeared. i have sensitive skin and product dose not seem to cause break outs,</li>
            <li> I use the serum with the Zeno machine and it makes the skin feel so smooth.  Combined with the machine it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Really like the Zeno.  Worked well to reduce wrinkles.  Would buy again.</li>
