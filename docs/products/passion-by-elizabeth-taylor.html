            <li>This has been by favorite for a long time, Amazon has great prices.  </li>

            <li>A fabulous product.</li>
            <li>Why use anything else when I get such great comments when I wear Passion.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>The product that my wife uses at a fantastic price.</li>
            <li>but hey its the same great perfume.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume and the price was right.</li>
            <li>This is one of my very favorite perfume scents I also love White Diamonds as well.</li>
            <li>As a teacher, my elementary students would tell me that they always knew when I was there because they could smell me---I asked if it was too strong but they assured me that it was a light smell they could follow.</li>
            <li>I have worn this for years and it works great with my body chemistry and lasts a long time on me.</li>
            <li>Other than that, a good product!</li>
            <li>Fabulous and the price is super.  </li>
            <li>Not too strong - to cause a headache - just the right fragrance to wear all day.</li>
            <li>I am very picky about fragrances, but have been using Passion by Elizabeth Taylor for more than 25 years.</li>
            <li>Elizabeth is always sweet her touch to anything she touches becomes a star studded event.</li>
            <li>My favorite scent -- delivered fast.  </li>
            <li>The same botttle that was fine to ship to me is classified as hazardous material when I try to return it</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the price as the last time they bought it they paid more.</li>
            <li>Quick ship as well.</li>
            <li>i was very pleased with product and service and would recomend to a friend i would  purchase again,this is second purchase of this perfume</li>
            <li>- - - it&#x27;s more than a wow scent!  </li>
            <li>very nice, slightly musky.</li>
            <li>It is the large bottle which is good because I wear it daily.</li>
            <li>This is the only kind I could wear or use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Price was right, shipping was timely.</li>
            <li>She just loves it and it does smell good as long as you don&#x27;t use to much.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much for continued production of Passion.</li>
            <li>luv this very fast delivery thank you</li>
            <li>Exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing Passion daily for about 15 years and have had many favorable comments.</li>
            <li>I have been buying this since it first came out</li>
            <li>and she really likes that !</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many years, the only one that doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze.</li>
            <li>the price on Amazon is always better than what I can get it for in local stores</li>
            <li>Every since I first tried it, Passion has just been My Scent.</li>
            <li>and you have to find something that works for you, but this is a good scent if you don&#x27;t want anything too heavy.</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly and was just as described, new in the box.  </li>
            <li>It has a lasting effect and that is good because I don&#x27;t have to go back and use it over and over again in a day.</li>
            <li>I love it and as with long time fragrance wearers it begins to identify you.  </li>
            <li>I have worn this particular fragrance for about 25 years, so it is obvious that I love it.</li>
            <li>The larger size arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li>This one is a real bargain.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Thanks..</li>
            <li>I would absolutely order again.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Packed very well.&lt;br /&gt;Passion</li>
            <li>As usual I was very pleased -</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>thanks so much.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>No problems got it in a reasonable time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of the other Elizabeth Taylor scents, but Passion has become my favorite cologne and the one I wear anytime</li>
            <li>This is a classic scent that my grandma has worn almost her whole life.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the purchase of the product purchase online on this store, recommend and hopefully make future purchases in the same, because they are really acceptable.</li>
            <li>My husband first bought this for me in the early 80&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Nothing smells like this classic..</li>
            <li>perfume is terrific!&lt;br /&gt;Especially for the mature woman, but also for the woman who is very self-confident, but also gentle.</li>
            <li>Most scents change on me, but Passion and White Diamonds last all day and evening.  </li>
            <li>I have always used this scent and love it even though more expensive ones have come along.  </li>
            <li>I use to order the cologne when they sold it at the better department stores, so I definitely would know the different .&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am glad JCP doesn&#x27;t carry this anymore as it was half the normal price I always paid.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I think may have been exposed too high heat</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>My significant other loves this perfume and it&#x27;s becoming harder to find.  </li>
            <li>I have loved this fragrance since Elizabeth Taylor marketed, just hard to find at a decent price, but with the internet anything is possible.</li>
            <li>One of my old favorites, cannot live without.!</li>
            <li>Bought this for my sister for Christmas, her late husband always bought it for her,  she loved it and said the size of the bottle was bigger than she thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Mainly because she used to wear this perfume when i was a child (i am now 22 years old).</li>
            <li>Like the small pure perfume with tiny stopper better though as it lasts much longer.</li>
            <li>Right size at the right price... Can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase for someone special.  </li>
            <li>Like my Gramma&amp;#34; said my 6 year old grandson.  </li>
            <li>Stays on all day and is a soft unoffensive fragrance.</li>
            <li>she thought it might be old stock, but to ber surprise it was just like she had before.</li>
            <li>I use Passion and its fragance compliment my natural body ordor.</li>
            <li>It smelled like it had gone bad--perhaps an old bottle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a soft scent that I&#x27;ve worn for years and still get compliments.</li>
            <li>Without fail, I always get someone remarking about its beautiful scent every single week - in elevators, in stores, wherever I go.</li>
            <li>A little bit sweet smelling so use sparingly.</li>
            <li>Smells so good and the smell lasts the longest out of all the perfumes I have used so far...even the very expensive designer ones.</li>
            <li>i love it; it&#x27;s hard to find in this area (i live in a really small town) -</li>

            <li> It stays on through the day without being overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> I have been wearing Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s Passion for many years.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been many years</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have always love this perfume.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I gave my wife her first bottle of Passion on our wedding day and she loved it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful soft scent.  </li>
            <li> I am glad that it is still available.  </li>
            <li> Women are very loyal to this perfume, and will make this their signature scent.</li>
            <li> There is a special essence and sort of magic to this lingering scent.  </li>
            <li> This is Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s first and best perfume ever along with white diamonds.  </li>
            <li> This has been by favorite for a long time, Amazon has great prices.  </li>
            <li> Best perfume ever made and half the price of what you get in the department stores.</li>
            <li> Glad to find exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased &amp; highly recommend this company.</li>
            <li> Plus free shipping</li>
            <li> A fabulous product.</li>
            <li> Why use anything else when I get such great comments when I wear Passion.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> The product that my wife uses at a fantastic price.</li>
            <li> but hey its the same great perfume.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume and the price was right.</li>
            <li> This is one of my very favorite perfume scents I also love White Diamonds as well.</li>
            <li> As a teacher, my elementary students would tell me that they always knew when I was there because they could smell me---I asked if it was too strong but they assured me that it was a light smell they could follow.</li>
            <li> I have worn this for years and it works great with my body chemistry and lasts a long time on me.</li>
            <li> Other than that, a good product!</li>
            <li> Fabulous and the price is super.  </li>
            <li> Not too strong - to cause a headache - just the right fragrance to wear all day.</li>
            <li> I am very picky about fragrances, but have been using Passion by Elizabeth Taylor for more than 25 years.</li>
            <li> Elizabeth is always sweet her touch to anything she touches becomes a star studded event.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent -- delivered fast.  </li>
            <li> The same botttle that was fine to ship to me is classified as hazardous material when I try to return it</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the price as the last time they bought it they paid more.</li>
            <li> Quick ship as well.</li>
            <li> i was very pleased with product and service and would recomend to a friend i would  purchase again,this is second purchase of this perfume</li>
            <li> - - - it&#x27;s more than a wow scent!  </li>
            <li> very nice, slightly musky.</li>
            <li> It is the large bottle which is good because I wear it daily.</li>
            <li> This is the only kind I could wear or use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Price was right, shipping was timely.</li>
            <li> She just loves it and it does smell good as long as you don&#x27;t use to much.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much for continued production of Passion.</li>
            <li> luv this very fast delivery thank you</li>
            <li> Exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Passion daily for about 15 years and have had many favorable comments.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this since it first came out</li>
            <li> and she really likes that !</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years, the only one that doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze.</li>
            <li> the price on Amazon is always better than what I can get it for in local stores</li>
            <li> Every since I first tried it, Passion has just been My Scent.</li>
            <li> and you have to find something that works for you, but this is a good scent if you don&#x27;t want anything too heavy.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and was just as described, new in the box.  </li>
            <li> It has a lasting effect and that is good because I don&#x27;t have to go back and use it over and over again in a day.</li>
            <li> I love it and as with long time fragrance wearers it begins to identify you.  </li>
            <li> I have worn this particular fragrance for about 25 years, so it is obvious that I love it.</li>
            <li> The larger size arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li> This one is a real bargain.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Thanks..</li>
            <li> I would absolutely order again.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Packed very well.&lt;br /&gt;Passion</li>
            <li> As usual I was very pleased -</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> thanks so much.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> No problems got it in a reasonable time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the other Elizabeth Taylor scents, but Passion has become my favorite cologne and the one I wear anytime</li>
            <li> This is a classic scent that my grandma has worn almost her whole life.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the purchase of the product purchase online on this store, recommend and hopefully make future purchases in the same, because they are really acceptable.</li>
            <li> My husband first bought this for me in the early 80&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Nothing smells like this classic..</li>
            <li> perfume is terrific!&lt;br /&gt;Especially for the mature woman, but also for the woman who is very self-confident, but also gentle.</li>
            <li> Most scents change on me, but Passion and White Diamonds last all day and evening.  </li>
            <li> I have always used this scent and love it even though more expensive ones have come along.  </li>
            <li> I use to order the cologne when they sold it at the better department stores, so I definitely would know the different .&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am glad JCP doesn&#x27;t carry this anymore as it was half the normal price I always paid.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I think may have been exposed too high heat</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> My significant other loves this perfume and it&#x27;s becoming harder to find.  </li>
            <li> I have loved this fragrance since Elizabeth Taylor marketed, just hard to find at a decent price, but with the internet anything is possible.</li>
            <li> One of my old favorites, cannot live without.!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister for Christmas, her late husband always bought it for her,  she loved it and said the size of the bottle was bigger than she thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Mainly because she used to wear this perfume when i was a child (i am now 22 years old).</li>
            <li> Like the small pure perfume with tiny stopper better though as it lasts much longer.</li>
            <li> Right size at the right price... Can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase for someone special.  </li>
            <li> Like my Gramma&amp;#34; said my 6 year old grandson.  </li>
            <li> Stays on all day and is a soft unoffensive fragrance.</li>
            <li> she thought it might be old stock, but to ber surprise it was just like she had before.</li>
            <li> I use Passion and its fragance compliment my natural body ordor.</li>
            <li> It smelled like it had gone bad--perhaps an old bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a soft scent that I&#x27;ve worn for years and still get compliments.</li>
            <li> Without fail, I always get someone remarking about its beautiful scent every single week - in elevators, in stores, wherever I go.</li>
            <li> A little bit sweet smelling so use sparingly.</li>
            <li> Smells so good and the smell lasts the longest out of all the perfumes I have used so far...even the very expensive designer ones.</li>
            <li> i love it; it&#x27;s hard to find in this area (i live in a really small town) -</li>
            <li> and it usually costs almost twice as much for a much smaller 1.5 oz bottle !</li>
            <li> It does not last long after sprayed.  </li>
            <li> The scent continues to enthrall, long after Liz has left us.</li>
            <li> Passion has been discontinued long ago.</li>
            <li> and we know how long ago that was.  </li>
            <li> I got a larger bottle than I expected.</li>
            <li> Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s Passion scent stays with you all day long!</li>
            <li> I have used this fragrance (Passion) for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> smell to it that lasted all day - even with trying to rub it off with a wet towel.  </li>
            <li> Received as expected.</li>
            <li> I even did a test and put a spray of my Passion (almost used up now) on one arm, and a spray of this on the other.  </li>
            <li> I have not read if there are any other posts like that other person&#x27;s and mine, but let me tell you folks,</li>
            <li> reason is, I don&#x27;t smell it myself but other people does,and I got alot of compliment&lt;</li>
            <li> The name says it all, and I wouldn&#x27;t have expected anything less from Elizabeth Taylor.</li>
            <li> The cheapest imitation of Passion.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to review a fragrance because everyone has different tastes</li>
            <li> IF I can find it locally which is hard.  </li>
            <li> I blew it off as sour grapes and that something else was in play.  </li>
            <li> It almost has a slight rancid aura about it.</li>
            <li> There are few places that I can still find this scent.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s on the market is old and stale.</li>
            <li> the scent was a little dull......</li>
            <li> want mote there is none in our town which is small....</li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time finding this scent in some of the stores, so</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding it elsewhere</li>
            <li> and it is hard to find in my area.</li>
            <li> , I ordered this from Amazon, in spite of someone else&#x27;s bad review saying the stuff must be old and stank.  </li>
            <li> I have never worn another perfume, cologne or any other scent (expensive or otherwise)</li>
            <li> My wife has worn Passion for years and we both agree this bottle was no good - did not smell like Passion.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it has become increasingly hard to find in the store</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wprn Passion for years and  never get tired of it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s virtually impossible to register a complaint for being stuck with a non-returnable item.</li>
            <li> The fragrance very weak.</li>
            <li> If they quit making this I will be so sad.</li>
            <li> Although it arrived ahead of schedule, the product itself is disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s return policy stinks, too.</li>
            <li> So please don&#x27;t take it out of the market,I don&#x27;t get sick of my stomach with this&lt;br</li>

            <li> and it affected smell in transit :(</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed that the fragrance was not as I remembered.</li>
            <li> It was rank!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this perfume, my favorite, have used it for many years and get compliments all the time. Smells so good and the smell lasts the longest out of all the perfumes I have used so far...even the very expensive designer ones.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne.  I have had a hard time finding this scent in some of the stores, so I thought I&#x27;d try Amazon.  I was delighted when I saw you not only had it, but it was cheaper than I had been paying before.</li>
            <li> Perfect... Just what I wanted</li>
            <li> Very pleased with purchase...</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume.  This one is a real bargain.  I will buy again, and again.&lt;br /&gt;Very nice fragrance.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great product and arrived on time. I would recommend this site to my friends.</li>
            <li> This product arrived as described. This is my wifeâ€™s favorite perfume and she have been using for many years. Great product, fast delivery and good price made this purchase a great deal. I definitively recommend this product and seller.</li>
            <li> This is one of my very favorite perfume scents I also love White Diamonds as well.</li>
            <li> A great cologne, at a great price.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t opened either bottle yet, but an excellent value.  Best price I&#x27;ve ever found.  Use this fragrance all the time, and get compliments ALL the time.</li>
            <li> Best price anywhere.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume and the price was right. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have used this fragrance (Passion) for a very long time.  I love it and as with long time fragrance wearers it begins to identify you.  &amp;#34;Gramma!  You always smell so good! Like my Gramma&amp;#34; said my 6 year old grandson.  Made me feel good.  The larger size arrived very quickly.  The smaller travel size took about 2 weeks from OxCom.</li>
            <li> Buyer beware - Amazon DOES NOT ALLOW RETURNS for perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;I have worn Passion ever since it came out 25 years ago and have gotten so many compliments on it, that it became &amp;#34;my fragrance&amp;#34; several years ago.  Nothing else compares for me.  I buy it about every 18 months or so, in the 1.5 or 2.0 bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I ordered this from Amazon, in spite of someone else&#x27;s bad review saying the stuff must be old and stank.  I blew it off as sour grapes and that something else was in play.  (My apologies to that person, btw) Well, they pinned it!  I even did a test and put a spray of my Passion (almost used up now) on one arm, and a spray of this on the other.  It was rank!  It had a peutrid (sp?) smell to it that lasted all day - even with trying to rub it off with a wet towel.  I have not read if there are any other posts like that other person&#x27;s and mine, but let me tell you folks, heed the warning and get it someplace else.  The price here for it IS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE!!!  I paid $19 for 2 oz and priced it at Walmart yesterday for $27 for 1.5 oz.  I will gladly pay more and get what I&#x27;m after.  I surely hope Amazon reads this.  It&#x27;s virtually impossible to register a complaint for being stuck with a non-returnable item. I&#x27;ve tried to no avail, as of yet.</li>
            <li> Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s Passion scent stays with you all day long! As a teacher, my elementary students would tell me that they always knew when I was there because they could smell me---I asked if it was too strong but they assured me that it was a light smell they could follow. I&#x27;ve had descriptions from yummy and delicious to sexy with this one...Why would I want to change?! I&#x27;m not a fan of the other Elizabeth Taylor scents, but Passion has become my favorite cologne and the one I wear anytime I leave the house. Buying it through Amazon&#x27;s seller saved me enough money that I could buy 2 bottles, instead of just one, for the price of one bottle locally. Check this cologne out and compare local store prices---you&#x27;ll be running back to order online from amazon! I definitely have a passion for Passion!</li>
            <li> I smell like Liz ...wonderful</li>
            <li> Perfect!  Exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li> I have worn this for years and it works great with my body chemistry and lasts a long time on me. Price was right, shipping was timely.</li>
            <li> Surprise gift for Gma! She loved it</li>
            <li> Very good buy, love this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love it. Husband agrees!! Thanks..</li>
            <li> Packaging was excellent and arrived on time. Beautiful scent; 100% happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> very nice, slightly musky.</li>
            <li> Nothing smells like this classic.. I also love the color purple, I think this was a great buy! Plus free shipping</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my wife for Christmas.  It did not smell anything like the passion that she has been wearing for many years. We are very much disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Passion daily for about 15 years and have had many favorable comments.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister for Christmas, her late husband always bought it for her,  she loved it and said the size of the bottle was bigger than she thought it would be.</li>
            <li> There are few places that I can still find this scent.  I am glad that it is still available.  I hope that you continue to carry it.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Passion for years because I always receive compliments on it.  Amazon has the best price anywhere.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Passion&amp;#34; what a great name for this Eau De Toilette Spray.  I have never worn another perfume, cologne or any other scent (expensive or otherwise) that gets the attention and response from men and women that &amp;#34;Passion&amp;#34; does. There is a special essence and sort of magic to this lingering scent.  I will buy again and again!</li>
            <li> Magic passion, it is very good for special occasions.</li>
            <li> My wife loved it.  Perrrrrfect!  I would absolutely order again.</li>
            <li> Great cologne  I&#x27;ve worn this for years</li>
            <li> I brought this as a present for my mom and she loves it.</li>
            <li> One of my old favorites, cannot live without.! Have used for years and I hope they never stop making this</li>
            <li> My wife didn&#x27;t care for it , i like it that&#x27;s why i bought It, so i gave it to my daughter and she loves it and wears it alot.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume - and Amazon offers the best deal.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne. Has a great scent and have received many compliments when I wear it.&lt;br /&gt;Try it you will like it.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume --I love it and good price too.</li>
            <li> I am very picky about fragrances, but have been using Passion by Elizabeth Taylor for more than 25 years. I was happy to find it on Amazon.com and it arrived so quickly. I am happy &amp;#34;to have Passion in my life again&amp;#34; !!</li>
            <li> Glad to find exactly what I was looking for!  Had choice of sizes and strengths.  Would order again.  What else can I say?</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grandma as a Christmas present and she loved it! Mainly because she used to wear this perfume when i was a child (i am now 22 years old). Beautiful smell for my grandma!</li>
            <li> This is a classic scent that my grandma has worn almost her whole life. Women are very loyal to this perfume, and will make this their signature scent.</li>
            <li> Love  passion.  I always get asked what I am wearing.</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS PERFUME!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT IS THE BEST!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells like flowers, candy and aromatic woods.  Just amazing!</li>
            <li> 5 stars for the escellent service &amp; transaction! Would buy from this seller again.&lt;br /&gt;The perfume is terrific!&lt;br /&gt;Especially for the mature woman, but also for the woman who is very self-confident, but also gentle.</li>
            <li> Although it arrived ahead of schedule, the product itself is disappointing.  It does not last long after sprayed.  I&#x27;ve been buying \\&quot;Passion\\&quot; for years and have never had this problem.</li>
            <li> My Husband had bought me this every year for Christmas.I have carried on the condition and I buy it every year and wrap it from him.</li>
            <li> Received as expected.</li>
            <li> It was a great deal on my favorite cologne!! I have a hard time finding it elsewhere and it usually costs almost twice as much for a much smaller 1.5 oz bottle !</li>
            <li> I bought Passion as a gift for my mom for Christmas since it is one of her favorite fragrances and she loved it! I would definitely buy this for her again.</li>
            <li> This is the gift that I give to my sister (who loves it!!) every year.  I have started using it myself.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> The perfume is great.  The price was good and the service was fantastic.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Great top quality product!  An elegant bottle and a sensuous scent.  I have purchased this product for years - it smells SOOOoooo good!!  I have used many others, but Passion is my favorite</li>
            <li> This arrived in a timely manner and my wife loves this brand of perfume.  What else is there to say</li>
            <li> If they quit making this I will be so sad. I get compliments every time I go out! Med especially like the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Price was good and we received it quickly. My wife has been buying Passion for years. She likes the fragrance.it.</li>
            <li> I am glad JCP doesn&#x27;t carry this anymore as it was half the normal price I always paid. I always get compliments when I where it. it almost smells like lavender powder. nice to spray on your pillowcase b4 bed too.</li>
            <li> Everything was just great  and so glad I was introduced to Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been using this perfume for years and years. Without fail, I always get someone remarking about its beautiful scent every single week - in elevators, in stores, wherever I go. So since I constantly get compliments ever since I started wear it - why change?</li>
            <li> Passion is my one and only cologne.....I am always asked  by co-workers and strangers alike&amp;#34;what are you wearing you smell so good!&amp;#34;  when you find a sent that you love and it works with your body chemistry it&#x27;s a great find!.  But add that it is so pleasing to everyone around you. that&#x27;s a bonus!!!</li>
            <li> Fabulous and the price is super.  Great for gifts for birthdays or Christmas etc.  A fabulous product. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> An awesome perfume !!</li>
            <li> Best perfume ever, discovered it in America.Loved it ever since.Great smell not overpowering get lots of compliments.Dusting powder and body lotion is also great.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance and I have worn it for years. Unfortunately, it has become increasingly hard to find in the store so I was very pleased to see I can buy it at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like Passion because it is a mellow type of spice scent. I receive compliments when I wear it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to review a fragrance because everyone has different tastes and you have to find something that works for you, but this is a good scent if you don&#x27;t want anything too heavy.</li>
            <li> Excellent seller and products and very nice</li>
            <li> Good for a Christmas Gift. My sister always has loved this fragrance.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for someone and they are pleased with it.  I am pleased with the price as the last time they bought it they paid more.</li>
            <li> Of course I&#x27;ll give this fragrance 5 Stars - - - after all - - - it&#x27;s more than a wow scent!  The name says it all, and I wouldn&#x27;t have expected anything less from Elizabeth Taylor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wprn Passion for years and  never get tired of it.</li>
            <li> I love Passion and have use it for many years.  Gets lots of compliments from everyone.  It is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Get numerous compliments when I wear this cologne.. Stays on all day and is a soft unoffensive fragrance. The price here was very good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased &amp; highly recommend this company.</li>
            <li> My favorite for many years - so nice just to click and it comes my way - no need to travel to the store.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for someone.</li>
            <li> Delivery was 1 day!!!! Packed very well.&lt;br /&gt;Passion - it&#x27;s lovely.</li>
            <li> MY FAVORITE PERFUME...BEEN WEARING IT FOR YEARS. PERFECT FOR ME. GOT A GREAT PRICE ON AMAZON.COM MY FAVORITE ONLINE SHOPPING SITE.</li>
            <li> Friends and strangers always comment on how good I smell. I have worn this for over twenty years and still get comments.</li>
            <li> Passion has been discontinued long ago. What&#x27;s on the market is old and stale. The fragrance very weak. It should be taken off the market. It saddens me because that was my favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this since it first came out and we know how long ago that was.  This is Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s first and best perfume ever along with white diamonds.  I must have them both.</li>
            <li> My girl loves it and so do I ! Makes me want to eat her up and she really likes that !</li>
            <li> Awesome fragrance. My mom has loved this perfume for years. Not too strong - to cause a headache - just the right fragrance to wear all day.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my mother in law, is here favorite perfume and an exceptional value for the money!</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my mother for Christmas, and she loved it.  I could not find this size at this price anywhere :)</li>
            <li> I get compliments on the way I smell, every day!</li>
            <li> I gave my wife her first bottle of Passion on our wedding day and she loved it. To my delight, she continues to wear Passion daily, 10 years later!</li>
            <li> I was highly pleased with the size and the price!!</li>
            <li> In my 40s and wearing this for 20 years. I ALWAYS get compliments.  I just hope it doesn&#x27;t go out of production.</li>
            <li> I have worn this particular fragrance for about 25 years, so it is obvious that I love it. The smell is not over powering, but stays with me as the day wears on.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it. This all she uses.</li>
            <li> Passion always smells great and was a good price. Like the small pure perfume with tiny stopper better though as it lasts much longer.</li>
            <li> ESTE PERFUME ES MUY RICO, Y LLEGO EN LA FECHA ESTIMADA EL VENDEDOR ES MUY RESPONSABLE, LO RECOMIENDO 100% Y LE VOLVER&amp;Iacute;A A COMPRAR OTRO DE SUS PRODUCTOS&lt;br /&gt;GRACIAS</li>
            <li> This Perfume stays on all day and evening.  It is Great.  Most scents change on me, but Passion and White Diamonds last all day and evening.  I just wish they&#x27;d bring back the Body Wash!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only perfume I wear.  Why use anything else when I get such great comments when I wear Passion.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for many years.</li>
            <li> My favorite!  Will be buying again!</li>
            <li> Right size at the right price... Can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase for someone special.  Love the fragrance as well.</li>
            <li> This has been by favorite for a long time, Amazon has great prices.  I keep one on my dressing table and one in the car.</li>
            <li> Oh my all time favorites</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the purchase of the product purchase online on this store, recommend and hopefully make future purchases in the same, because they are really acceptable.</li>
            <li> As usual I was very pleased -</li>
            <li> I have always used this scent and love it even though more expensive ones have come along.  This was a great price for something I always want to have on hand.  Vendor shipped out immediately.  Very happy</li>
            <li> It was a good value for the price.  It can cost more and nice to have it delivered.  This perfume always makes me feel good and is a beautiful sent.  It is the large bottle which is good because I wear it daily.</li>
            <li> I love the product. I have used it for many years and will continue to do so. No complaints at all.</li>
            <li> No problems ! arrived in perfect condition !</li>
            <li> This has been my  favorite fragrance for years. So glad to be able to get it again. I get SO many compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s signature perfume, she always smells great with it on.</li>
            <li> Good but not the best.....the scent was a little dull......like it was sitting on the shelf forever! Other than that, a good product!</li>
            <li> Have worn it on and off since it was introduced, and it&#x27;s the only scent that I&#x27;m ALWAYS complimented on when I wear it.  Was thrilled to find gift set here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have loved this fragrance since Elizabeth Taylor marketed, just hard to find at a decent price, but with the internet anything is possible.</li>
            <li> My wife has loved this perfume for 50 years.</li>
            <li> i love it; it&#x27;s hard to find in this area (i live in a really small town) - everything went great, ordering, shipping, all around very happy!</li>
            <li> she thought it might be old stock, but to ber surprise it was just like she had before. So we reorder 2 more bottles.&lt;br /&gt;great find and very nice price!!!</li>
            <li> My fave and only perfume. Amazon has the best price</li>
            <li> Elizabeth is always sweet her touch to anything she touches becomes a star studded event.</li>
            <li> Proven product delivered on time.  Packaged as well as store-offered product.</li>
            <li> i was very pleased with product and service and would recomend to a friend i would  purchase again,this is second purchase of this perfume</li>
            <li> have been using passion ever since it came out</li>
            <li> Item as advertised; great price as well.</li>
            <li> I use Passion and its fragance compliment my natural body ordor. It has a lasting effect and that is good because I don&#x27;t have to go back and use it over and over again in a day.</li>
            <li> The scent continues to enthrall, long after Liz has left us.</li>
            <li> Nicely priced. A little bit sweet smelling so use sparingly.</li>
            <li> Wife is happy with this so I&#x27;m happy too...</li>
            <li> came, smelling a bit &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; from same I buy at store. I think may have been exposed too high heat and it affected smell in transit :(</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years, the only one that doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze.</li>
            <li> The product that my wife uses at a fantastic price.</li>
            <li> My wife has worn Passion for years and we both agree this bottle was no good - did not smell like Passion. Amazon&#x27;s return policy stinks, too. The same botttle that was fine to ship to me is classified as hazardous material when I try to return it and I can&#x27;t get a replacement or my $$ back.</li>
            <li> I only use this Passion by Elizabeth Taylor - I love it and the price on Amazon is always better than what I can get it for in local stores IF I can find it locally which is hard.  Very nice perfume</li>
            <li> My significant other loves this perfume and it&#x27;s becoming harder to find.  The product arrived quickly and was just as described, new in the box.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> So so nice wearing this</li>
            <li> It smells good. Thank you.</li>
            <li> What can I say...love Liz. Been using her Passion spray for 20 years and hope to for the next 20.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good seller. Recomended.</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for Mom.  Her fave!!</li>
            <li> Love it, great price will be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed that the fragrance was not as I remembered. It smelled like it had gone bad--perhaps an old bottle.</li>
            <li> my sister turned me onto this perfume about 18 years ago. I have never bought anything else. and the price was and has been so good off Amazon.. thanks so much. I now have 3 bottles . Christmas 2 people gave me 2 smaller bottles than this one. but hey its the same great perfume. love love love it</li>
            <li> She love this perfume. I can&#x27;t say anymore about than that. She just loves it and it does smell good as long as you don&#x27;t use to much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this perfume before. I bought it in Tobago and search for it in Sweden but havn&#x27;t found it here. And it is just lovely.</li>
            <li> do you want to smell like a middle aged old lady? THEN THIS PERFUME IS FOR YOU! my mom and MEMAW! cant get enough of this. I don&#x27;t know if it has some type of secrete powers but they go threw some bottles of it. Now that ive shown them the inter-web they freaked and oder 2 bottles every 6 months.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance and the price is very good.</li>
            <li> ESTE PEDIDO LO HICE DESDE EL 30 DE NOVIEMBRE Y TODAV&amp;Iacute;A NO LO RECIBIDO  ESTOY EN ESPERA DEL MISMO DIOS QUIERA Y LLEGUE PRONTO</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  My husband is allergic to most scents, but not this one.  It&#x27;s a soft scent that I&#x27;ve worn for years and still get compliments.</li>
            <li> I have worn this product for over twenty years and I still get compliments each time i have it on.</li>
            <li> The cheapest imitation of Passion.  I use to order the cologne when they sold it at the better department stores, so I definitely would know the different .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A.L.</li>
            <li> Violet Eyes by Elizabeth Taylor. Good price for a nice scent and it is hard to find in my area.</li>
            <li> I have been using Passion for decades, and I love it!!.</li>
            <li> I really, really love this perfume or colongne. This is the only kind I could wear or use.&lt;br /&gt;The reason is, I don&#x27;t smell it myself but other people does,and I got alot of compliment&lt;br /&gt;about it.So please don&#x27;t take it out of the market,I don&#x27;t get sick of my stomach with this&lt;br /&gt;perfume and I don&#x27;t get dizzy.Thank you very much for continued production of Passion.</li>
            <li> want mote there is none in our town which is small....</li>
            <li> Love it!  It stays on through the day without being overwhelming.  I get compliments all the time.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent -- delivered fast.  thanks</li>
            <li> Beautiful soft scent.  My husband first bought this for me in the early 80&#x27;s.  I loved it then and after all the years gone by it&#x27;s scent is as I remembered it. Great price and great product.  Quick ship as well.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s Passion for many years.  Every since I first tried it, Passion has just been My Scent.</li>
            <li> purchased as a gift. recipient loved it</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my Mom-in-Law.  She loves it.  It was a good price for the siae of the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to some perfumes so when I find one whose fragrance is great on me, I stick to it. This is one I&#x27;ll continue to use.</li>
            <li> I used to wear nothing but PASSION by Elizabeth Taylor. It&#x27;s been many years and so I thgouth I&#x27;d try it again. I remember loving it. It&#x27;s not as I remember it at all. It almost has a slight rancid aura about it. Or perhaps it&#x27;s just me. I realize that scents render differently on everyone and perhaps my body chemistry has changed. Not sure. Either way, it&#x27;s not what I anticipated. But I&#x27;ll keep it.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this product for years and is very happy with it.</li>
