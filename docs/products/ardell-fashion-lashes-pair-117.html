            <li>These lashes are pretty good.</li>
            <li>These ones are great because they brighten your eyes and look somewhat natural.</li>
            <li>Not too long, but full and the perfect width.</li>
            <li>I really loved how realistic the lashes looked.</li>

            <li>They arrived in perfect condition (not all crushed) and we&#x27;re shipped and received quickly.</li>
            <li>to all those reading this review right now, try these now!</li>
            <li>They look natural when they are one and the length is amazing.</li>
            <li>Therefore they don&#x27;t look as full.</li>
            <li>But both are good for regular use.</li>
            <li>My first time tried them on, I was so thrilled and came back to amazon to get more.</li>
            <li>These are very easy to put on and almost too natural looking.</li>
            <li>They look natural and apply very easily.</li>
            <li>If you want a little daytime drama, these are great without being overstated.</li>
            <li>Loved my eyelashes a good size for casual events</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this number , they are good for both day and evening wear with a little bit more mascara , and you can reuse them numerous times if you take them off properly</li>
            <li>If the inner and outer corners were shorter then they might have been okay.</li>
            <li>Great lashes that you can use at least 3 times if you do not use too much glue!</li>
            <li>I prefer 105, which I wear daily.&lt;br /&gt;They are similar, but the 117 has a littler more space in between each lash.</li>
            <li>I always get these lashes because theyre easy to use and the glue dries clear and they come off when you&#x27;re ready to take them off no problem.</li>
            <li>Full natural look</li>
            <li>If you use oil free eye make up remover to clean it every night, and put it back to the container to keep its nice shape, each set last for a very long time.</li>
            <li>they are very thick and drastic but overall very beautiful</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive and got a bunch.</li>
            <li>It does work great as a practice tool for those who want to learn how to apply false lashes on people.</li>
            <li>I wear false lashes daily and have found these to be the best.</li>
            <li>I think i like other numbers better</li>
            <li>looks pretty natural too!</li>
            <li>Absolutely beautiful dramatic but natural looking lashes</li>
            <li>They are too light and not dark enough.  </li>
            <li>It clearly says Pack of 4</li>
            <li>Looks natural.  </li>
            <li>But I got the natural lashes instead of the fashion lashes.</li>
            <li>I like the length and the natural look but the white glue stands out.</li>
            <li>I may try something more dramatic when going out</li>
            <li>A little too much for the day though</li>
            <li>Other than being a teeny bit overlong, these lashes look very natural and hold up for weeks (if you remove them properly) before you have to toss them.</li>

            <li> These are really beautiful and excellent quality. My first time tried them on, I was so thrilled and came back to amazon to get more. If you use oil free eye make up remover to clean it every night, and put it back to the container to keep its nice shape, each set last for a very long time.</li>

            <li> Easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t look fake. I used these for a dance show production and they made my eyes look fabulous!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re perfect for a night out or even just dinner!! Noticeable, but not too long!! A little too much for the day though</li>
            <li> These are good lashes. I wanted to give these a try and see how they compare to 105. I prefer 105, which I wear daily.&lt;br /&gt;They are similar, but the 117 has a littler more space in between each lash. Therefore they don&#x27;t look as full. But both are good for regular use. You can&#x27;t go wrong with either! I LOVE Ardell lashes!</li>
            <li> I liked them very much but prefer  their Glamour ones.</li>
            <li> Absolutely beautiful dramatic but natural looking lashes</li>
            <li> My sister has been wearing these lashes for more than 5 years and she loves them. Not too long, but full and the perfect width. I bought these as a gift for her, that is why I&#x27;m writing the review. She would definitely recommend this product. P.S. if you use a toothpick to apply the glue to the lashes, you get a perfect line and no globs.</li>
            <li> I am subscribed to these lashes , I have nothing bad to say about them . They are the perfect size , I never have to had to cut them down . I absolutely love this number , they are good for both day and evening wear with a little bit more mascara , and you can reuse them numerous times if you take them off properly</li>
            <li> Other than being a teeny bit overlong, these lashes look very natural and hold up for weeks (if you remove them properly) before you have to toss them. If you want a little daytime drama, these are great without being overstated.</li>
            <li> These are fabulous they fit well, and you will need your own glue but the value is great for this product. Arrived on time and I am greatly pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I really loved how realistic the lashes looked. They fit wonderfully and were very comfortable. I would recommend and I might buy them again if I need too.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite lashes. I couldnt find them at the drugstore or anywhere else. Very inexpensive and got a bunch. Loved them</li>
            <li> I like the length and the natural look but the white glue stands out. I had to put black mascara over the glue.</li>
