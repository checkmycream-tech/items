            <li>it&#x27;s great product and it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing stuff!</li>
            <li>It does come off when you wash your hair, but it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>I have alopecia at the top of my head and this covers my bald spot perfectly.</li>
            <li>Excellent product and better priced than another good product i.e Toppik...</li>
            <li>Now my hair seems stronger and keeps looking good for about 5 days without washing.  </li>
            <li>this powder is good, but not as good as Toppik.</li>
            <li>#34;It looks good,  </li>
            <li>Thank you X-fusion for making the good products.</li>
            <li>work good</li>
            <li>I gave this one as a gift and the recipient is very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I gain my confident!</li>
            <li>It has been an amazing find, and I honestly don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.</li>
            <li>result is amazing .</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any of the fancy accessories either, and just use my own hairspray.</li>
            <li>It blends perfectly in with your real hair.  </li>
            <li>If there are any African-Americans on the fence on how effective this would be to them here&#x27;s your support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>and when I shake it on my hair,  Toppik immediately gives that nice coverage without hassle</li>
            <li>Great product,  works best on short hair.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very fine also.</li>
            <li>my hair is very important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am also thinning on top.  </li>
            <li>, i have been on minoxidil for more than 2 years</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect magic here...</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t regrow your hair instantaneously, but this is better than anything I have tried yet.</li>
            <li>Would recommend for sure.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this product that I would give it 6 stars if I could.</li>
            <li>and I can say I am not losing any more hair.  </li>
            <li>and they love it :-)</li>
            <li>and costs me precious time.</li>
            <li>Safe to use.</li>
            <li>It fills in and is one of the most miraculous hair care products I&#x27;ve ever come across, for hair</li>
            <li>and on top of that I also model, so</li>
            <li>I love it and will be buying it going forward</li>
            <li>Many people have commented that my hair has been looking thicker.</li>
            <li>this works and doesn&#x27;t require too many touchups.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I was using eye shadow to cover up my  hair loss and this works much better.  </li>
            <li>the price is better than purchasing at a salon.</li>
            <li>This stuff really fluffs up your hair and was great when my hair fell out after my two pregnancies.</li>
            <li>PERFECT FOR THAT EXTRA BOOST OF CONFIDENCE.  </li>
            <li>It is OK for use.</li>
            <li>Was also impressed with the reasonable price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Its amazing how much this makes my hair look better, and my hair could use some more, well, hair.</li>
            <li>You can use a light spray of any kind of hair spray to lock the fibers in place, and on days when I don&#x27;t wash my hair, I just do a quick touch up and spray again.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper than other brands like Toppik, but it works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li>It washes out easily when I shampoo and doesnt rub off on pillows or anywhere else.</li>
            <li>(but this can be easily cleaned as it doesn&#x27;t harden or get sticky).</li>
            <li>Contents inside seems clumped up; it was not coming out easily.</li>
            <li>Trying special vitamins and colloidal minerals to get myself and hair healthy.  </li>
            <li>I do notice that the tiny particles have a tendency to clog my pores and I get more breakouts, so I don&#x27;t use it all the time, but when I do the change is astounding!</li>
            <li>It worked fine for me.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>and when I wash it off it is a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>Once you put on  Xfusion and comb and hair spray, it will not come off while sleeping or with the wind or even brushing your hair lightly.  </li>
            <li>so I always reluctant to put my hair up in those fabulous sock buns.</li>
            <li>It stays on when I sweat, or if I get caught in light rain.  </li>
            <li>I then went to work on a very hot sweaty day, got exposed to some wind, enough to normally really screw up my do, but my hair was still perfect when I checked it with 2 mirrors.  </li>
            <li>It does however Rub off on Pillows at night, so you May want to wash it out or wear a head covering before going to bed, It Does However wash right out without issue!</li>
            <li>Just shake it on the bald spot and it fills it right in !</li>
            <li>Item came in within the expected time frame and in great condition.</li>
            <li>I have bought a second can because the first can worked great.</li>
            <li>and I can be out with my sock bun with full confidence!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall is good, but stick after a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>long as you get the right color to match your hair color, you&#x27;ll look great and no one will ever be the wiser.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t clean the bathroom any more often than I normally would with this product.  </li>
            <li>Now if my hair gets messed up, it still looks great in the back even upon really close inspection it looks like full head of hair.  </li>
            <li>it totaly covered the bold area</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s a main concern for many.</li>
            <li>This product is cheaper and much better than the highly advertised Caboki.</li>
            <li>It looks pretty original (even my wife hasn&#x27;t noticed) and stays on until you wash your hair.</li>
            <li>My hair looks fuller and my confidence level is much higher!  </li>
            <li>EXACTLY!  </li>
            <li>Once i put it in, It automatically matches my hair wonderfully, and my natural hair color is jet black</li>
            <li>I shake some on the top of my head far away from hair line.  </li>
            <li>Before you say anything I work in the restaurant Biz and everyone I know is brutally honest, they are not about holding back!</li>
            <li>If adds body and fills in thin areas perfectly.  </li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t describe how it was useful for me .</li>
            <li>As long as my hair is dry this goes on perfectly.</li>
            <li>You cannot see anything, it blends right in with the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li>and i can&#x27;t believe it it blends in in your hair and looks exactly like it</li>
            <li>It really does make her hair look fuller!</li>
            <li>well done...when he did that he grabbed my head exactly where I put the Keratin fibers.  </li>
            <li>The fibers will come out with consistent combing, brushing, and of course soap and water.</li>
            <li>Fill in powder with a brush is easier to control and put it on really lightly and far from the hair line.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to hair spray many times daily.  </li>
            <li>Just today for the first time she asked if I tint my hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never forget how I felt the first time a stylist used this on me.</li>
            <li>My head looked like I had more hair, literally instantly.</li>
            <li>The second thing that sets it apart is, it stays on your head better than its competition.  </li>
            <li>Yes this is the first time I have used XFusion , the product works,</li>
            <li>X-Fusion and Toppik make the best fake hair</li>
            <li>Before you leave the house make sure you have brushed or wiped it all off.</li>
            <li>I first purchased this from a hair salon and paid $50.  </li>
            <li>when I told them, I&#x27;ve become an unpaid spokesman, I do Keep my hair in a very short, &amp;#34;Crew Cut&amp;#34; and I think this product works best with short styles and minor patches.</li>
            <li>There are two things I don&#x27;t like about the product: First, it rubs off onto my pillow at night and second, it leaves a fine dusting of product all over the bathroom each time you use it.  </li>
            <li>Now that I have more serious hair loss issues, I have to use a lot more.  </li>
            <li>, I always make sure I never run out, and it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li>The sprayer is unpredictable and does not work as good as just using Xfusion direct.</li>
            <li>And now she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>When keeping up with that became too much of a hassle, I searched the internet and found this product.  </li>
            <li>So much so, that no one has ever noticed or questioned if I had \\&quot;something\\&quot; in my head, not even close friends or family members.  </li>
            <li>It stays put threw the whole day.</li>
            <li>Modern medicine?  </li>
            <li>YES, AND IT REALLY WORKS</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see anyone (except one gentleman) who listed their ethnicity.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair look so much fuller.</li>
            <li>Toppik layers on really well</li>
            <li>it is nice, i like it but turns green when i sweat.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if most of this is from my eyes getting used to seeing myself with full hair</li>
            <li>Also if you dont have thick hair its not as good</li>
            <li>This covers my bald spot better than any other spray or dye ever has.</li>
            <li>Sure it may take 15 minutes to put Xfusion on just right, once on, no worries for 5 days.&lt;br /&gt;Learning how to do very little on my front for a fuller look.  </li>
            <li>With X-Fusion, you really notice little, if any buildup on bathroom surfaces for a week or more.  </li>
            <li>I quickly went to Rogaine hoping that my hair would grow back.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend for both females and males.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going the hair fiber route, I highly recommend you go with X-Fusion.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
            <li>This product works really well and looks natural on me.</li>
            <li>The fibers blend in very well and it looks natural to cover the bald spot.</li>
            <li>they all said pretty much the same thing, &amp;</li>
            <li>Sprinkle it on lightly, pat it down gently, then hair spray.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried about four other powder fibers, and you needed to clean the bathroom after every use, to stay on top of the mess.  </li>
            <li>These things are only minor annoyances, that I am more than willing to deal with in exchange for a product that hides a really big insecurity of mine.  </li>
            <li>Will update this review with new info if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;BTW  </li>
            <li>You have to be extra careful when you apply it to the hair line, as it is easy to apply too much there.  </li>
            <li>I am so self conscious about my thinning hair!  </li>
            <li>Im a loyal Toppik user and recommend the product to every woman I meet with fine, thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not sure why, but this stuff looks a lot more natural than Nanogen or Toppik.</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t clean it regularly you&#x27;ll start to see it compiling on your sink, floors, toilet, etc.</li>
            <li>That said if your head is even a little moist it just sticks to your scalp in more obvious patches.</li>
            <li>i realized I don&#x27;t have a lot left up top, thick in some spots and just wisps in others, but this Certainly fills the bill.</li>
            <li>right:(&lt;br /&gt;Xfusion will bridge the gap until modern medicine can actually do something about hair loss.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Xfusion even fixed that for me, 5 days no problem.  </li>
            <li>It does look natural, and works well all the way around.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a powder so you should be conscious that it might fall on your face and clothes when you apply it.</li>
            <li>It surprised me how well</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for inventing a product that actually works and is affordable!!</li>
            <li>AS I BEGAN THINNING AT A YOUNG AGE.</li>
            <li>I like to dab it on then rub it in with a manoxadil foam until the texture is natural.  </li>
            <li>just make sure your head is dry because i put some minoxidil after i put this and not very cool</li>
            <li>Pain stakingly using 2 mirrors and combing my hair just right and hair spray, only to have it loosen up an hour later or even worse with any kind of wind,</li>
            <li>saw this product for half  the price of Toppik and figured to give it a go as I have pretty much tried all Fiber products (Kabuki, Oscar Blondi, Toppik).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If it rains or I sweat, there is no mess.</li>
            <li>front is fine, but there is a small spot thinning.  </li>
            <li>In fact I can just comb my hair like normal without using an extra mirror, then check it</li>
            <li>Very natural, I look 10 years younger, feels great.&lt;br /&gt;Btw</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinning badly at the top of my head and just a few taps of this little bottle, makes my head look like it is full of my own hair.</li>
            <li>Previously I would wash my hair every day, if not it just did not look right.  </li>
            <li>This particular batch des not hold as well or as long as my purchase from the salon.</li>
            <li>you are not careful.</li>
            <li>Wow, I feel 10 years younger.  </li>
            <li>That sets it far above its competition.  </li>
            <li>But I am a guy who is not bald, but who feels that my hair is thinner than it once was (only 30 years old).  </li>
            <li>I can run my fingers through my hair and the fibers barely even show on my hands.  </li>
            <li>I have to be careful how much I put on or it will stain the scalp</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally black and when xfusion is applied correctly it blends very well with my natural hair.  </li>
            <li>Then rub it down with my fingers towards hair line, then for a more even look I brush my front scalp until it is not noticeable at all but blends in very slightly.  </li>
            <li>This product covers my thinning areas so well, and it looks very natural, as long as you don&#x27;t over-apply.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell much difference between this and other brands.</li>
            <li>It is a little dulling for African American hair, so I have to add a little oil sheen after to reduce the dullness, but that is far better than shiny scalp and see through hair.  </li>
            <li>The final thing, that was huge for me is, it leaves far less of a mess on pillows, couches, etc.  </li>
            <li>Looked at minoxidol, but odds of success are low and odds of making it worse in 48 weeks time are almost certain.  </li>
            <li>I have some serious thinning around the crown area, and as a female, this is a huge problem for me.  </li>
            <li>Seriously, the back of my head has not looked this good for at least 5 years.  </li>
            <li>I can decide how much to use or how little.</li>
            <li>The first is, it is far less of a mess in the bathroom.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Excellent product and better priced than another good product i.e Toppik...</li>
            <li> Now my hair seems stronger and keeps looking good for about 5 days without washing.  </li>
            <li> this powder is good, but not as good as Toppik.</li>
            <li> #34;It looks good,  </li>
            <li> Thank you X-fusion for making the good products.</li>
            <li> work good</li>
            <li> I gave this one as a gift and the recipient is very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I gain my confident!</li>
            <li> It has been an amazing find, and I honestly don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.</li>
            <li> result is amazing .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any of the fancy accessories either, and just use my own hairspray.</li>
            <li> It blends perfectly in with your real hair.  </li>
            <li> If there are any African-Americans on the fence on how effective this would be to them here&#x27;s your support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> and when I shake it on my hair,  Toppik immediately gives that nice coverage without hassle</li>
            <li> Great product,  works best on short hair.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very fine also.</li>
            <li> my hair is very important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am also thinning on top.  </li>
            <li> , i have been on minoxidil for more than 2 years</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect magic here...</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t regrow your hair instantaneously, but this is better than anything I have tried yet.</li>
            <li> Would recommend for sure.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this product that I would give it 6 stars if I could.</li>
            <li> and I can say I am not losing any more hair.  </li>
            <li> and they love it :-)</li>
            <li> and costs me precious time.</li>
            <li> Safe to use.</li>
            <li> It fills in and is one of the most miraculous hair care products I&#x27;ve ever come across, for hair</li>
            <li> and on top of that I also model, so</li>
            <li> I love it and will be buying it going forward</li>
            <li> Many people have commented that my hair has been looking thicker.</li>
            <li> this works and doesn&#x27;t require too many touchups.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I was using eye shadow to cover up my  hair loss and this works much better.  </li>
            <li> the price is better than purchasing at a salon.</li>
            <li> This stuff really fluffs up your hair and was great when my hair fell out after my two pregnancies.</li>
            <li> PERFECT FOR THAT EXTRA BOOST OF CONFIDENCE.  </li>
            <li> It is OK for use.</li>
            <li> Was also impressed with the reasonable price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Its amazing how much this makes my hair look better, and my hair could use some more, well, hair.</li>
            <li> You can use a light spray of any kind of hair spray to lock the fibers in place, and on days when I don&#x27;t wash my hair, I just do a quick touch up and spray again.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper than other brands like Toppik, but it works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li> It washes out easily when I shampoo and doesnt rub off on pillows or anywhere else.</li>
            <li> (but this can be easily cleaned as it doesn&#x27;t harden or get sticky).</li>
            <li> Contents inside seems clumped up; it was not coming out easily.</li>
            <li> Trying special vitamins and colloidal minerals to get myself and hair healthy.  </li>
            <li> I do notice that the tiny particles have a tendency to clog my pores and I get more breakouts, so I don&#x27;t use it all the time, but when I do the change is astounding!</li>
            <li> It worked fine for me.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> and when I wash it off it is a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> Once you put on  Xfusion and comb and hair spray, it will not come off while sleeping or with the wind or even brushing your hair lightly.  </li>
            <li> so I always reluctant to put my hair up in those fabulous sock buns.</li>
            <li> It stays on when I sweat, or if I get caught in light rain.  </li>
            <li> I then went to work on a very hot sweaty day, got exposed to some wind, enough to normally really screw up my do, but my hair was still perfect when I checked it with 2 mirrors.  </li>
            <li> It does however Rub off on Pillows at night, so you May want to wash it out or wear a head covering before going to bed, It Does However wash right out without issue!</li>
            <li> Just shake it on the bald spot and it fills it right in !</li>
            <li> Item came in within the expected time frame and in great condition.</li>
            <li> I have bought a second can because the first can worked great.</li>
            <li> and I can be out with my sock bun with full confidence!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall is good, but stick after a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> long as you get the right color to match your hair color, you&#x27;ll look great and no one will ever be the wiser.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t clean the bathroom any more often than I normally would with this product.  </li>
            <li> Now if my hair gets messed up, it still looks great in the back even upon really close inspection it looks like full head of hair.  </li>
            <li> it totaly covered the bold area</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s a main concern for many.</li>
            <li> This product is cheaper and much better than the highly advertised Caboki.</li>
            <li> It looks pretty original (even my wife hasn&#x27;t noticed) and stays on until you wash your hair.</li>
            <li> My hair looks fuller and my confidence level is much higher!  </li>
            <li> EXACTLY!  </li>
            <li> Once i put it in, It automatically matches my hair wonderfully, and my natural hair color is jet black</li>
            <li> I shake some on the top of my head far away from hair line.  </li>
            <li> Before you say anything I work in the restaurant Biz and everyone I know is brutally honest, they are not about holding back!</li>
            <li> If adds body and fills in thin areas perfectly.  </li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t describe how it was useful for me .</li>
            <li> As long as my hair is dry this goes on perfectly.</li>
            <li> You cannot see anything, it blends right in with the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li> and i can&#x27;t believe it it blends in in your hair and looks exactly like it</li>
            <li> It really does make her hair look fuller!</li>
            <li> well done...when he did that he grabbed my head exactly where I put the Keratin fibers.  </li>
            <li> The fibers will come out with consistent combing, brushing, and of course soap and water.</li>
            <li> Fill in powder with a brush is easier to control and put it on really lightly and far from the hair line.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to hair spray many times daily.  </li>
            <li> Just today for the first time she asked if I tint my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never forget how I felt the first time a stylist used this on me.</li>
            <li> My head looked like I had more hair, literally instantly.</li>
            <li> The second thing that sets it apart is, it stays on your head better than its competition.  </li>
            <li> Yes this is the first time I have used XFusion , the product works,</li>
            <li> X-Fusion and Toppik make the best fake hair</li>
            <li> Before you leave the house make sure you have brushed or wiped it all off.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this from a hair salon and paid $50.  </li>
            <li> when I told them, I&#x27;ve become an unpaid spokesman, I do Keep my hair in a very short, &amp;#34;Crew Cut&amp;#34; and I think this product works best with short styles and minor patches.</li>
            <li> There are two things I don&#x27;t like about the product: First, it rubs off onto my pillow at night and second, it leaves a fine dusting of product all over the bathroom each time you use it.  </li>
            <li> Now that I have more serious hair loss issues, I have to use a lot more.  </li>
            <li> , I always make sure I never run out, and it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> The sprayer is unpredictable and does not work as good as just using Xfusion direct.</li>
            <li> And now she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> When keeping up with that became too much of a hassle, I searched the internet and found this product.  </li>
            <li> So much so, that no one has ever noticed or questioned if I had \\&quot;something\\&quot; in my head, not even close friends or family members.  </li>
            <li> It stays put threw the whole day.</li>
            <li> Modern medicine?  </li>
            <li> YES, AND IT REALLY WORKS</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see anyone (except one gentleman) who listed their ethnicity.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair look so much fuller.</li>
            <li> Toppik layers on really well</li>
            <li> it is nice, i like it but turns green when i sweat.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if most of this is from my eyes getting used to seeing myself with full hair</li>
            <li> Also if you dont have thick hair its not as good</li>
            <li> This covers my bald spot better than any other spray or dye ever has.</li>
            <li> Sure it may take 15 minutes to put Xfusion on just right, once on, no worries for 5 days.&lt;br /&gt;Learning how to do very little on my front for a fuller look.  </li>
            <li> With X-Fusion, you really notice little, if any buildup on bathroom surfaces for a week or more.  </li>
            <li> I quickly went to Rogaine hoping that my hair would grow back.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend for both females and males.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going the hair fiber route, I highly recommend you go with X-Fusion.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product works really well and looks natural on me.</li>
            <li> The fibers blend in very well and it looks natural to cover the bald spot.</li>
            <li> they all said pretty much the same thing, &amp;</li>
            <li> Sprinkle it on lightly, pat it down gently, then hair spray.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried about four other powder fibers, and you needed to clean the bathroom after every use, to stay on top of the mess.  </li>
            <li> These things are only minor annoyances, that I am more than willing to deal with in exchange for a product that hides a really big insecurity of mine.  </li>
            <li> Will update this review with new info if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;BTW  </li>
            <li> You have to be extra careful when you apply it to the hair line, as it is easy to apply too much there.  </li>
            <li> I am so self conscious about my thinning hair!  </li>
            <li> Im a loyal Toppik user and recommend the product to every woman I meet with fine, thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not sure why, but this stuff looks a lot more natural than Nanogen or Toppik.</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t clean it regularly you&#x27;ll start to see it compiling on your sink, floors, toilet, etc.</li>
            <li> That said if your head is even a little moist it just sticks to your scalp in more obvious patches.</li>
            <li> i realized I don&#x27;t have a lot left up top, thick in some spots and just wisps in others, but this Certainly fills the bill.</li>
            <li> right:(&lt;br /&gt;Xfusion will bridge the gap until modern medicine can actually do something about hair loss.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Xfusion even fixed that for me, 5 days no problem.  </li>
            <li> It does look natural, and works well all the way around.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a powder so you should be conscious that it might fall on your face and clothes when you apply it.</li>
            <li> It surprised me how well</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for inventing a product that actually works and is affordable!!</li>
            <li> AS I BEGAN THINNING AT A YOUNG AGE.</li>
            <li> I like to dab it on then rub it in with a manoxadil foam until the texture is natural.  </li>
            <li> just make sure your head is dry because i put some minoxidil after i put this and not very cool</li>
            <li> Pain stakingly using 2 mirrors and combing my hair just right and hair spray, only to have it loosen up an hour later or even worse with any kind of wind,</li>
            <li> saw this product for half  the price of Toppik and figured to give it a go as I have pretty much tried all Fiber products (Kabuki, Oscar Blondi, Toppik).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If it rains or I sweat, there is no mess.</li>
            <li> front is fine, but there is a small spot thinning.  </li>
            <li> In fact I can just comb my hair like normal without using an extra mirror, then check it</li>
            <li> Very natural, I look 10 years younger, feels great.&lt;br /&gt;Btw</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinning badly at the top of my head and just a few taps of this little bottle, makes my head look like it is full of my own hair.</li>
            <li> Previously I would wash my hair every day, if not it just did not look right.  </li>
            <li> This particular batch des not hold as well or as long as my purchase from the salon.</li>
            <li> you are not careful.</li>
            <li> Wow, I feel 10 years younger.  </li>
            <li> That sets it far above its competition.  </li>
            <li> But I am a guy who is not bald, but who feels that my hair is thinner than it once was (only 30 years old).  </li>
            <li> I can run my fingers through my hair and the fibers barely even show on my hands.  </li>
            <li> I have to be careful how much I put on or it will stain the scalp</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally black and when xfusion is applied correctly it blends very well with my natural hair.  </li>
            <li> Then rub it down with my fingers towards hair line, then for a more even look I brush my front scalp until it is not noticeable at all but blends in very slightly.  </li>
            <li> This product covers my thinning areas so well, and it looks very natural, as long as you don&#x27;t over-apply.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell much difference between this and other brands.</li>
            <li> It is a little dulling for African American hair, so I have to add a little oil sheen after to reduce the dullness, but that is far better than shiny scalp and see through hair.  </li>
            <li> The final thing, that was huge for me is, it leaves far less of a mess on pillows, couches, etc.  </li>
            <li> Looked at minoxidol, but odds of success are low and odds of making it worse in 48 weeks time are almost certain.  </li>
            <li> I have some serious thinning around the crown area, and as a female, this is a huge problem for me.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, the back of my head has not looked this good for at least 5 years.  </li>
            <li> I can decide how much to use or how little.</li>
            <li> The first is, it is far less of a mess in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> The big deal was not one single person neither female or male realized it was an &amp;#34;enhancement.&amp;#34; and thought it was my actual</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no mess for me, unlike some of the videos I&#x27;ve seen on youtube about other products.</li>
            <li> It really makes my hair look fuller no more embarrassing bald spots showing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who needs to cover some thin areas and still look as if they have a full head of hair.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair on top, black, and lots of grey.  </li>
            <li> The five stars here is a relative rating, as I&#x27;m looking at this relative to other hair loss concealers in the same category.  </li>
            <li> Instant thick hair, no thin spots and</li>
            <li> As with any of these products, a natural hair line in front can be tricky, but is doable with a little practice.  </li>
            <li> You obviously can&#x27;t get your hair too wet</li>
            <li> Be aware of that, especially if you use a darker color, as you may have a few dark beads of water running down your forehead.  </li>
            <li> When I&#x27;ve used other hair fibers, they all end up on the back of the couch when I lean my head against it, or on my pillow at night.  </li>
            <li> Xfusion goes on dry</li>
            <li> When I wash my hair and dry it, it does look thinner.  </li>
            <li> The trick is you have to sprinkle it on slow and steady until it looks like what you want.</li>
            <li> I am able to completely cover up a small bald spot and make thin hair look amazingly thick.</li>
            <li> I have short black and thinning hair all around my scalp.</li>
            <li> to apply, and only a little is needed.  </li>
            <li> Just a little work and very tiny bit of Xfusion does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If your scalp gets wet enough, it will start to run a little bit.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful when sprinkling it because it will go all over your face</li>
            <li> Front hair line was even harder.  </li>
            <li> I use my fingers to align the fibers throughout my thin hair area and gently move into area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not certain, but I think it may have been &amp;#34;watered down&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> If you are abroad I would recommend to chose an other store.</li>
            <li> Not too powdery like the other hair fibers being sold in the market.</li>
            <li> Has possibly ordered from this merchant in the past.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it takes a longer than usual to arrive.</li>
            <li> We are still in the dark ages here.  </li>
            <li> once played a full game of basketball, and when the game was over one of my teammates came over to me and gave me a \\&quot;teammate hug\\&quot; for a job</li>
            <li> I wasted my money trying to buy the other cheaper brand.</li>
            <li> Previously if I did not wash my hair for 2-3 days the dandruff would set in.  </li>
            <li> I like the black color of X-fusion brand.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dark brown, so I switch between black and dark brown.</li>
            <li> not good if you have a big bald.</li>
            <li> It stays put with a little spray</li>
            <li> So I need to work 10 minutes every day to cover it, and then with just a little wind, on goes the hat.  </li>
            <li> A little rain does not bother it either.  </li>
            <li> , I just sprinkle it on, spray a little hair spray to set</li>
            <li> but this product needs a little help.  </li>
            <li> This product is part of my everyday grooming.</li>
            <li> I have waited for this product for a few weeks now and still have not received this item.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday, and will probably use it for the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> or it will fall out, but do not worry about going about your everyday routine with this in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and then when I go back it appears worse.  </li>
            <li> I sweat heavily at work on the line and have not had any issues with it running</li>
            <li> There are a few things that set X-Fusion apart from the competition.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that after showering the product doesn&#x27;t spread as well and looks like it&#x27;s clumping, so just shower a few hours before you plan using Xfusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Something is missing and I can&#x27;t put my finger on it yet.</li>
            <li> If you have thin hair and need coverage, look no further.</li>
            <li> Stays put even after sweating at the gym due to heavy workout!!</li>
            <li> I was shocked when I open the package to find that this product is put out by the same company that makes TOPPIK.</li>
            <li> These little keratin fibers have changed my life!</li>
            <li> Very little of this stuff ever comes off on anything until I shower in the morning.  </li>

            <li> it is nice, i like it but turns green when i sweat. Also if you dont have thick hair its not as good</li>
            <li> Serves its purpose well.</li>
            <li> This product is part of my everyday grooming. I have several crowns at the back of my head and the hair lays so that part of my scalp shows at times. I am also thinning on top.  This product makes both situations disappear.</li>
            <li> I have waited for this product for a few weeks now and still have not received this item. Hopefully somebody can help me with this!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> I was shocked when I open the package to find that this product is put out by the same company that makes TOPPIK. It is just cheaper in price. Dang, I wish I knew this years ago.</li>
            <li> OMG OMG....i wish i knew about this a while ago ... i&#x27;m 23 my hair is thinning big time on the front part of my head , i have been on minoxidil for more than 2 years and it&#x27;s not doing that great i ordered this last week and i can&#x27;t believe it it blends in in your hair and looks exactly like it it totaly covered the bold area and i look like i&#x27;m 10 years younger.... just make sure your head is dry because i put some minoxidil after i put this and not very cool</li>
            <li> I placed the over &amp;agrave; month ago, still havent got the item. If you are abroad I would recommend to chose an other store.</li>
            <li> My mom was referred to this product by her sister. And now she absolutely loves it. It really does make her hair look fuller! She doesn&#x27;t go a day without using it. Item came in within the expected time frame and in great condition.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect magic here...it doesn&#x27;t regrow your hair instantaneously, but this is better than anything I have tried yet. I am able to completely cover up a small bald spot and make thin hair look amazingly thick. It looks pretty original (even my wife hasn&#x27;t noticed) and stays on until you wash your hair. Would recommend for sure. I don&#x27;t have any of the fancy accessories either, and just use my own hairspray.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 5 years now, and have tried countless competitors (Hair topper,Toppik, etc.) but none of them compare to the texture, versatility and overall value of Xfusion. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone. It&#x27;s so good, my barber can&#x27;t even tell the difference!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;ve used it for the last 2 years. It&#x27;s a great addition to any hair restoration treatment. I use it with Rogain, Propecia and the Laser comb. Nobody can tell my hair is thinning.</li>
            <li> When my hair started thinning, I panicked.  I quickly went to Rogaine hoping that my hair would grow back.  My hair loss was starting on the crown of my head.  When keeping up with that became too much of a hassle, I searched the internet and found this product.  I use it everyday, and will probably use it for the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply, and only a little is needed.  It blends perfectly in with your real hair.  So much so, that no one has ever noticed or questioned if I had \\&quot;something\\&quot; in my head, not even close friends or family members.  I exercise, play basketball, and even shower with keratin fibers in my head.  You obviously can&#x27;t get your hair too wet or it will fall out, but do not worry about going about your everyday routine with this in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I once played a full game of basketball, and when the game was over one of my teammates came over to me and gave me a \\&quot;teammate hug\\&quot; for a job well done...when he did that he grabbed my head exactly where I put the Keratin fibers.  Nothing was on his hand, and nothing came out of my head.  This occurred about one week after I started using it, so this ended up being the the moment that totally sold me on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this should work well with all hair types; I&#x27;m African-American with short hair. If there are any African-Americans on the fence on how effective this would be to them here&#x27;s your support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  Do not scratch your head in the spot you have the fibers because it will get under your fingernails.  The fibers will come out with consistent combing, brushing, and of course soap and water.</li>
            <li> temporary solution to cover up your bald in small places...not good if you have a big bald. Recommending the product</li>
            <li> Its amazing how much this makes my hair look better, and my hair could use some more, well, hair. As long as my hair is dry this goes on perfectly. That said if your head is even a little moist it just sticks to your scalp in more obvious patches.</li>
            <li> works as well as twice expensive product.</li>
            <li> For those debating, as I did, will this work, I shout to you, YES IT DOES! I&#x27;m thinning badly at the top of my head and just a few taps of this little bottle, makes my head look like it is full of my own hair. It&#x27;s amazing stuff! It does come off when you wash your hair, but it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t for this, I might never leave home with confidence.  I am so self conscious about my thinning hair!  But since they haven&#x27;t found a product that will grow it back yet (I have tried them all!) this makes things bearable.  It stays put with a little spray and then I go about my days with confidence.  It is a little dulling for African American hair, so I have to add a little oil sheen after to reduce the dullness, but that is far better than shiny scalp and see through hair.  Until they can grow hair, this is a great alternative!</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this product that I would give it 6 stars if I could. It really makes my hair look fuller no more embarrassing bald spots showing. Just be careful when sprinkling it because it will go all over your face it you are not careful.</li>
            <li> awesome product. color matched perfectly. order arrived before projected delivery date, which was great!</li>
            <li> I can decide how much to use or how little. It washes out easily when I shampoo and doesnt rub off on pillows or anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair on top, black, and lots of grey.  This works so well, I always make sure I never run out, and it lasts a long time! It stays put threw the whole day.</li>
            <li> Works great! I had never used hair fibers before but my temple area has been shedding like crazy from being on medication so this has helped to hide the thinness I have in that area while I try out some cures for my hair loss.</li>
            <li> Wow, I feel 10 years younger.  Seriously, the back of my head has not looked this good for at least 5 years.  I have been working a comb over for 3 years.  Pain stakingly using 2 mirrors and combing my hair just right and hair spray, only to have it loosen up an hour later or even worse with any kind of wind, even just a drop of wind would expose the spot, about 3 inches diameter.  I still have hair there but not enough to cover the white scalp.  So I need to work 10 minutes every day to cover it, and then with just a little wind, on goes the hat.  You know what I am talking about.&lt;br /&gt;Well, with Xfusion, I just part my hair after blow drying.  Apply Xfusion to all exposed white area.  Then I do my comb over.  Guess what?  My comb over is immediate.  No need to work at it.  Looks great.  In fact I can just comb my hair like normal without using an extra mirror, then check it and it is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I put it on to test it, then went to bed, woke up and it was still perfect.  I just combed my hair and sprayed it with regular aerosol hair spray.  I then went to work on a very hot sweaty day, got exposed to some wind, enough to normally really screw up my do, but my hair was still perfect when I checked it with 2 mirrors.  Nice.&lt;br /&gt;My front is fine, but there is a small spot thinning.  I have not tried it there yet.  Waiting to get the pump to try that.  Will update this review with new info if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;BTW  Trying special vitamins and colloidal minerals to get myself and hair healthy.  Looked at minoxidol, but odds of success are low and odds of making it worse in 48 weeks time are almost certain.  Does not seem like a plan to me.  We are still in the dark ages here.  Modern medicine?  Yeah right:(&lt;br /&gt;Xfusion will bridge the gap until modern medicine can actually do something about hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;Update 8/27/2013, I tried the pump sprayer attachment.  It did not work out.  The sprayer is unpredictable and does not work as good as just using Xfusion direct.Front hair line was even harder.  I find for the front, Fill in powder with a brush is easier to control and put it on really lightly and far from the hair line.&lt;br /&gt;So there you go, Xfusion in the back, and Fill in powder for improving the front a bit.  Very natural, I look 10 years younger, feels great.&lt;br /&gt;Btw Once you put on  Xfusion and comb and hair spray, it will not come off while sleeping or with the wind or even brushing your hair lightly.  In fact once on, I don&#x27;t even need hair spray anymore, maybe once a day.  I used to hair spray many times daily.  Now if my hair gets messed up, it still looks great in the back even upon really close inspection it looks like full head of hair.  I just comb it back when I get a chance and back to perfection.  A little rain does not bother it either.  I went 4 days between hair wash, and still looked great.  I put it through a lot of extremes and it surpassed my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;9/11/2013 Update:  I found Xfusion to strengthen my hair.  Previously I would wash my hair every day, if not it just did not look right.  Now my hair seems stronger and keeps looking good for about 5 days without washing.  Xfusion goes on dry so it seems like it absorbs oil on the scalp, and also no flaking either.  Previously if I did not wash my hair for 2-3 days the dandruff would set in.  Xfusion even fixed that for me, 5 days no problem.  Sure it may take 15 minutes to put Xfusion on just right, once on, no worries for 5 days.&lt;br /&gt;Learning how to do very little on my front for a fuller look.  I shake some on the top of my head far away from hair line.  Then rub it down with my fingers towards hair line, then for a more even look I brush my front scalp until it is not noticeable at all but blends in very slightly.  Front is hard, I can go without, but why not.  Just a little work and very tiny bit of Xfusion does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;I also gave Xfusion a stress test, I drove my Ninja motorcycle around my area at speeds up to 35 mph with nohelmet.  My hair was blowing but still looked great, lady in the back seat did not suspect a thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12/16/2013 Update:  I am not completely sure, but I thought this made me lose some hair at first.  When I wash my hair and dry it, it does look thinner.  I am not sure if most of this is from my eyes getting used to seeing myself with full hair and then when I go back it appears worse.  Now I have been using this for 4 months and I can say I am not losing any more hair.  Just initially it seemed to be thinner when I washed my hair.  It has not changed anymore since.  Even when I wash my hair I do not see any hairs falling out.  I am starting to think it is just a perception thing, I get accustomed to having all my hair and when I wash it off it is a huge difference.  Even when I look at my drivers license photo from last year I get shocked.&lt;br /&gt;I have not even had to put a hat on in 4 months.  This should help my hair breathe without needing a hat.  Wife does not suspect a thing.  Just today for the first time she asked if I tint my hair.  I said no,I have some grays here and there.  One thing I will tell you, this is very addictive.  Once you have your hair back, you can never leave the house again without it.</li>
            <li> excellent product!!!!!!!!!!!!! I bought it for my mom and for my husband and they love it :-)</li>
            <li> This product is cheaper and much better than the highly advertised Caboki. This is my 2nd order and its a miracle fiber. I use my fingers to align the fibers throughout my thin hair area and gently move into area. Its a great product!</li>
            <li> Great product! Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> So here is the deal. this powder is good, but not as good as Toppik. My big problem is the applicator spray. It sucks. It will retract VERY slowly after pushing the bubble to spray the fiber. I mean it takes 2 min between sprays. This means 10 min for me to get hair done in the morning. at a minimum. and costs me precious time.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Not too powdery like the other hair fibers being sold in the market.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best cover for thinning hair that I&#x27;ve found. My hair is naturally black and when xfusion is applied correctly it blends very well with my natural hair.  I use the term &#x27;correctly&#x27; because as with the application of any product you purchase there is a correct and an incorrect way to apply it to achieve the best result. Apart from my wife and my hair stylist no one else can tell the difference.</li>
            <li> YES, AND IT REALLY WORKS</li>
            <li> The keratin fiber worked wonders on my thinning hair.  My hair looks fuller and my confidence level is much higher!  I highly recommend for both females and males.</li>
            <li> I had been shaving my head for years, but when I decided to let it grow back i realized I don&#x27;t have a lot left up top, thick in some spots and just wisps in others, but this Certainly fills the bill. I tried it on a whim it then had every female I knew , from the family, girl friends and work friends take a look and feel it. they all said pretty much the same thing, &amp;#34;It looks good,  whats the big deal?&amp;#34;. EXACTLY!  The big deal was not one single person neither female or male realized it was an &amp;#34;enhancement.&amp;#34; and thought it was my actual hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Before you say anything I work in the restaurant Biz and everyone I know is brutally honest, they are not about holding back! They too were shocked and amazed when I told them, I&#x27;ve become an unpaid spokesman, I do Keep my hair in a very short, &amp;#34;Crew Cut&amp;#34; and I think this product works best with short styles and minor patches. I sweat heavily at work on the line and have not had any issues with it running, I just sprinkle it on, spray a little hair spray to set and I&#x27;m Done. It does however Rub off on Pillows at night, so you May want to wash it out or wear a head covering before going to bed, It Does However wash right out without issue!</li>
            <li> I have bought a second can because the first can worked great. It&#x27;s just enough to cover up spots. It doesn&#x27;t fall out on your clothes at least you can&#x27;t see if it does so that&#x27;s a main concern for many. Safe to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never forget how I felt the first time a stylist used this on me. One moment, the rather startling part in my hair was visible, after a few shakes of the XFusion, it was gone. My head looked like I had more hair, literally instantly. I was sold!&lt;br /&gt;As long as you get the right color to match your hair color, you&#x27;ll look great and no one will ever be the wiser. It fills in and is one of the most miraculous hair care products I&#x27;ve ever come across, for hair that&#x27;s thin in places, or a hairline that needs some help.</li>
            <li> The five stars here is a relative rating, as I&#x27;m looking at this relative to other hair loss concealers in the same category.  There are a few things that set X-Fusion apart from the competition.  The first is, it is far less of a mess in the bathroom.  I&#x27;ve tried about four other powder fibers, and you needed to clean the bathroom after every use, to stay on top of the mess.  With X-Fusion, you really notice little, if any buildup on bathroom surfaces for a week or more.  I really don&#x27;t clean the bathroom any more often than I normally would with this product.  The second thing that sets it apart is, it stays on your head better than its competition.  It&#x27;s not perfect here.  If your scalp gets wet enough, it will start to run a little bit.  Be aware of that, especially if you use a darker color, as you may have a few dark beads of water running down your forehead.  It&#x27;s still above the others in its class this way though.  I&#x27;ve had miserable experiences with those.  The final thing, that was huge for me is, it leaves far less of a mess on pillows, couches, etc.  When I&#x27;ve used other hair fibers, they all end up on the back of the couch when I lean my head against it, or on my pillow at night.  Very little of this stuff ever comes off on anything until I shower in the morning.  That sets it far above its competition.  It does look natural, and works well all the way around.  As with any of these products, a natural hair line in front can be tricky, but is doable with a little practice.  If you&#x27;re going the hair fiber route, I highly recommend you go with X-Fusion.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of these reviews trying to determine whether or not to buy this product because I was uncertain if it would work for Men of Color.  I didn&#x27;t really see anyone (except one gentleman) who listed their ethnicity.  But I am a guy who is not bald, but who feels that my hair is thinner than it once was (only 30 years old).  I still like to wear longer grown hairstyles (Afro&#x27;s, bobs, mohawks etc.) and on top of that I also model, so my hair is very important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is UNBELIEVABLY GREAT!  Once i put it in, It automatically matches my hair wonderfully, and my natural hair color is jet black and it&#x27;s very fine also. I can run my fingers through my hair and the fibers barely even show on my hands.  I love it and will be buying it going forward and it&#x27;s not as expensive as Caboki, which I though was a God sent.  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who needs to cover some thin areas and still look as if they have a full head of hair.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and works great. I gave this one as a gift and the recipient is very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not certain, but I think it may have been &amp;#34;watered down&amp;#34;. This particular batch des not hold as well or as long as my purchase from the salon.</li>
            <li> Works soooooo well!!  Stays put even after sweating at the gym due to heavy workout!!</li>
            <li> Yes this is the first time I have used XFusion , the product works,have tried others  which are messy ...will use  XFusion  again and again!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and better priced than another good product i.e Toppik...</li>
            <li> Totally recommend this product for those of us with thinning hair.  Covers up those bald spots that make us all cry.</li>
            <li> Product works great. I have short black and thinning hair all around my scalp. This product works really well and looks natural on me. Many people have commented that my hair has been looking thicker. It will only work if you have some hair because the fibers attach to your existing hair. I&#x27;ve noticed that after showering the product doesn&#x27;t spread as well and looks like it&#x27;s clumping, so just shower a few hours before you plan using Xfusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the fibers get all over your bathroom and if you don&#x27;t clean it regularly you&#x27;ll start to see it compiling on your sink, floors, toilet, etc. (but this can be easily cleaned as it doesn&#x27;t harden or get sticky).</li>
            <li> My hairdresser turned me on to this stuff and all I can say is it&#x27;s miraculous!  Instant thick hair, no thin spots and it lasts and lasts.  I do notice that the tiny particles have a tendency to clog my pores and I get more breakouts, so I don&#x27;t use it all the time, but when I do the change is astounding!</li>
            <li> Ordered 2 bottles this time. Has possibly ordered from this merchant in the past. Started recently using the them. Contents inside seems clumped up; it was not coming out easily. I had to toss it to the ground, or bang it against some hard surfaces to loosen the contents. I never had problems in past. There is not an issue in concealing my thinning areas, but simply getting the contents out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> X-Fusion and Toppik make the best fake hair (Toppik review here http://www.amazon.com/review/R35558HOTTNMZM ).  I get the .87 oz for about $25.  My hair is very dark brown, so I switch between black and dark brown.</li>
            <li> I have tried different hair fibers. This brand  X-fusion works best to my opinion. The fibers blend in very well and it looks natural to cover the bald spot. I wasted my money trying to buy the other cheaper brand. Their black color looks blue, and it&#x27;s awful. I like the black color of X-fusion brand. Thank you X-fusion for making the good products. I gain my confident!</li>
            <li> I have alopecia at the top of my head and this covers my bald spot perfectly. You cannot see anything, it blends right in with the rest of my hair. Just shake it on the bald spot and it fills it right in ! Cheapter than going to the hair club!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. It&#x27;s cheaper than other brands like Toppik, but it works perfectly for me. Sprinkle it on lightly, pat it down gently, then hair spray. There&#x27;s no mess for me, unlike some of the videos I&#x27;ve seen on youtube about other products.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair so I always reluctant to put my hair up in those fabulous sock buns. This product solved my problem! This covers every embarrassing bald spot and I can be out with my sock bun with full confidence!&lt;br /&gt;It is a powder so you should be conscious that it might fall on your face and clothes when you apply it. Before you leave the house make sure you have brushed or wiped it all off.</li>
            <li> Great buy. Will continue to purchase from seller. Makes my hair look so much fuller.</li>
            <li> It surprised me how well this works and doesn&#x27;t require too many touchups. I put it on once or twice a week. If it rains or I sweat, there is no mess. It just sticks. The trick is you have to sprinkle it on slow and steady until it looks like what you want.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about two years now.  I started off using Toppik, then decided to give X-Fusion a try because of the price difference and I have been using it ever since.  I love this product.  It has saved me a lot of embarrassment.  I have some serious thinning around the crown area, and as a female, this is a huge problem for me.  This product covers my thinning areas so well, and it looks very natural, as long as you don&#x27;t over-apply.  You have to be extra careful when you apply it to the hair line, as it is easy to apply too much there.  There is a hair line optimizer that you can buy, but I haven&#x27;t tried that.  There are two things I don&#x27;t like about the product: First, it rubs off onto my pillow at night and second, it leaves a fine dusting of product all over the bathroom each time you use it.  It becomes noticeable after three or four uses.  These things are only minor annoyances, that I am more than willing to deal with in exchange for a product that hides a really big insecurity of mine.  You can use a light spray of any kind of hair spray to lock the fibers in place, and on days when I don&#x27;t wash my hair, I just do a quick touch up and spray again.  It stays on when I sweat, or if I get caught in light rain.  I cover my head in heavier rain, and I definitely wouldn&#x27;t go swimming with it in, though.&lt;br /&gt;Back when my hair had just started thinning, I used very little of the stuff.  Now that I have more serious hair loss issues, I have to use a lot more.  In either case, I would recommend this product.  It has been an amazing find, and I honestly don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this from a hair salon and paid $50.  Can&#x27;t beat this price and it works great. I was using eye shadow to cover up my  hair loss and this works much better.  Shake the powder on and off I go.  Before people would would notice my thinning hair, not anymore.</li>
            <li> Work excellent as a hair filler for thinning hair.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to anyone and the price is better than purchasing at a salon.</li>
            <li> Im a loyal Toppik user and recommend the product to every woman I meet with fine, thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;I saw this product for half  the price of Toppik and figured to give it a go as I have pretty much tried all Fiber products (Kabuki, Oscar Blondi, Toppik).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to like this product but the consistency is kinda funky. Something is missing and I can&#x27;t put my finger on it yet. Toppik layers on really well and when I shake it on my hair,  Toppik immediately gives that nice coverage without hassle but this product needs a little help.  I have to be careful how much I put on or it will stain the scalp and I have to scratch off the excess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  believe I will keep this as a backup for when my Toppik runs out and I&#x27;m stuck between orders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update later.</li>
            <li> If you have thin hair and need coverage, look no further. This covers my bald spot better than any other spray or dye ever has. HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
            <li> One bottle lasts a year - great price. This stuff really fluffs up your hair and was great when my hair fell out after my two pregnancies.</li>
            <li> This product works great and the price is great too. The only thing is that it takes a longer than usual to arrive. So if you can order way ahead of time.</li>
            <li> These little keratin fibers have changed my life! Thank you so much for inventing a product that actually works and is affordable!!</li>
            <li> PERFECT FOR THAT EXTRA BOOST OF CONFIDENCE.  I DONT LEAVE THE HOUSE WITHOUT IT! IN FACT I DONT KNOW WHAT I DID BEFORE IT AS I BEGAN THINNING AT A YOUNG AGE.</li>
            <li> Great product,  works best on short hair.  I like to dab it on then rub it in with a manoxadil foam until the texture is natural.  If adds body and fills in thin areas perfectly.  Just don&#x27;t let it get in your eyes.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great product and it&#x27;s result is amazing . i can&#x27;t describe how it was useful for me . i suggestible for you to buy it .</li>
            <li> Overall is good, but stick after a couple of hours. I chose X-Fusion because it is cheaper. It is OK for use.</li>
            <li> On time delivery,&lt;br /&gt;product work good</li>
            <li> It worked fine for me. I can&#x27;t tell much difference between this and other brands. Will try again. n n</li>
            <li> Not sure why, but this stuff looks a lot more natural than Nanogen or Toppik. Was also impressed with the reasonable price and fast delivery. This is all I will buy now.</li>
