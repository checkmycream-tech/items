            <li> Please note you need to carefully slide the headband off, hair can get caught and a little tangled.</li>
            <li> the complaint I have is that it was slight bit to small, and it gives me a headache to wear it for a while.</li>
            <li> It snap and cut my finger.look at te reviews if it says small Beverly carefull</li>
            <li> Very hard elastic band</li>
            <li> The product was broken when it arrived</li>
            <li> and I was unable to use it for my wedding</li>

            <li> I waited awhile to get this. It&#x27;s a very pretty head band I accidentally ordered the same head band from another seller so I had two. which worked out because one fit perfectly this one however is kid size. When I tried to put it on the metal became that attaches the silver. It snap and cut my finger.look at te reviews if it says small Beverly carefull my pinky finger is bruised and has a cut. So glad I got the other one. People stop by my job just to see what headband I&#x27;m wearing that day.</li>
            <li> The product was broken when it arrived and I was unable to use it for my wedding</li>
