            <li>The effect is amazing, i did not not expect it considering the price of the product.</li>
            <li>This setting powder works amazingly.</li>
            <li>To be honest, this product did not work well for me.</li>
            <li>but then I started noticing my make up staying in tact much longer and looking perfect from morning to night.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m using my own.</li>
            <li>i think the powder is effective and blends well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m full of smiles, great to hear</li>
            <li>light and airy... nice!</li>
            <li>I love this setting powder and when I run out I will be buying more!</li>
            <li>I love using the ELF face setting HD powder as well , but this is grand for under you eye !</li>
            <li>works very good really like it.</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing under eye setting powder I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>It is very fine and undetectable.  </li>
            <li>It is very &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34; and spreads beautifully.  </li>
            <li>Great product, it does exactly what it said it does, which is to conceal under eye bags.</li>
            <li>It feels very smooth &amp; does have glimmer.  </li>
            <li>Very smooth application.  </li>
            <li>Since it was so cheap, I grabbed up the three that they had, and am soooooo glad I did!</li>
            <li>I just switched to mac prolong wear concealer but needed a nice setting powder to sit on top so makeup won&#x27;t sink in fine lines and smudge, etc.</li>
            <li>Such A Wonderful Product!!</li>
            <li>I love elf and all of their products.</li>
            <li>I use it on the top lid also.</li>
            <li>This product did not work well for me and did not provide coverage, even if I applied powdered foundation on top.</li>
            <li>I applied more powder and it still does not conceal anything.</li>
            <li>I have been avoiding putting any type of powder under my eyes because it seemed to make wrinkles more noticeable, this product doesn&#x27;t seem to do that</li>
            <li>Oh, how my wrinkles love this &#x27;Concealer&#x27;.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like freaking MAGIC.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>So worth the money really good quality.</li>
            <li>I like the idea of an undereye setting powder, but I&#x27;m not in love with this one.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love using this when I am in a hurry.  </li>
            <li>Does not do anything for concealing, but it works okay for making sure your make up doesn&#x27;t build up in the under eye area if you have creases there.</li>
            <li>and I love this product.</li>
            <li>all it takes to work its magic.</li>
            <li>It is not a concealer, but more of an eye highlighter/brightener.</li>
            <li>Even tried it on a stubborn age spot for coverage and worked better than a concealer.</li>
            <li>I will probably order more.</li>
            <li>BUT&lt;br /&gt;IT WORKS BETTER FOR ME WITH MY CONCEALER</li>
            <li>Looks awesome in pics, you get younger softer eyes !</li>
            <li>Maybe I was just expecting more than what this product delivered</li>
            <li>I think I was hoping for more of a highlighting effect - and that isn&#x27;t what this is supposed to be.</li>
            <li>Soo many girls on YouTube rave about this product, so i had to try it</li>
            <li>I might just start using contacts more often.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my wife and she is really satisfied with it</li>
            <li>Ok, So I knew this was a setting powder, but I did not expect the shimmer.</li>
            <li>I think I was expecting something more along the lines of the Ben Nye Luxury Powder...</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>It is ok but needs to be reapplied</li>
            <li>Works better applied before concealer</li>
            <li>Love this concealer, it never cakes ..</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m so pleased</li>
            <li>ELF products are fabulous!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Satisfied with this product</li>
            <li>I love this powder.  </li>
            <li>I do not know how thi looks on darker skin tones, but I would assume you would get more of a Jennifer Lopez look under your eyes.</li>
            <li>and I have more issues with wandering/melting mascara</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see any magical brightening properties.</li>
            <li>There are a lot better brands out</li>
            <li>there - a bit more $, but</li>
            <li>It will not make your under eye circles look better.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know I had so many till using this powder.  </li>
            <li>love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
            <li>Item was a lot smaller that i anticipated yet the product itself made up for that with its wonderful application and coverage over my liquid highlighing concealers.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Accompanying brush and sifter top makes application easy and goof-proof.</li>
            <li>It filled in the nooks and crannies and I could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li>So glad I found this version of extremely good high quality HD powder !</li>
            <li>its a good product but for certain skin types</li>
            <li>I am very fair, and the powder is WHITE</li>
            <li>I apply this light powder on top of my concealer to set it in place.</li>
            <li>I love elf product its there cheap and they work</li>
            <li>Make sure your concealer is well blended to avoid it caking on into ur eye creases ,the color is perfect pearl to offset any dark circles or corrector concealer tones !</li>
            <li>It goes on so easily.</li>
            <li>Its so easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, too.</li>
            <li>A LOT, its drives them nuts but makes me feel younger and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I have dark circles under my eyes and when i use this product it looks like my face is flawless.</li>
            <li>It goes on fine</li>
            <li>I like the fine texture</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and easily.  </li>
            <li>This powder sets my undereye concealer and does not accent fine lines or wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>This powder seems to showcase fine lines.  </li>
            <li>This provides a light softening effect, while highlighting and setting concealer around your eyes.</li>
            <li>The color is too light.</li>
            <li>, I think it is because of the shimmer in it and therefore being light deflecting.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and clea</li>
            <li>It is feather light.</li>
            <li>As others have said in different reviews, the brush that comes with it isn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li>It sets and feels smooth, almost creamy.</li>
            <li>Great for white women though.</li>
            <li>I added this to my cart to qualify for free shipping ($3 Add-on item).</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but felt like it was worth a try since it&#x27;s so inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I only have to apply this in the morning and still looks great at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>It was exactly as advertised!!</li>
            <li>I recommend rolling the brush across your under eye area then pat and lightly blend this setting powder all around your whole eye and on top of your top level eye shadow near the brow and inner eye corners for a flawless look !</li>
            <li>I am just being honest and this is my opinion on this particular product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get rid of the lines, but it sure masks them very, very well.</li>
            <li>It comes with a small brush that is perfect for the job.</li>
            <li>WORTH THE WAIT!</li>
            <li>It simply makes everything look natural, but flawless.</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty cool, It goes on easy an super easy to blend out.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s my fair skin, or maybe I used a smaller amount.</li>
            <li>Love that it keeps my under eye concealer set in place throughout the day but could really do without the glittery effect it gives.</li>
            <li>Love this for setting under the eyes, works really well.</li>
            <li>Any kind of fine line instantly disappears!</li>
            <li>Great product was as expected!</li>
            <li>I have used other e.l.f. products and have been happy with the results but not in this case.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Seller was fast and great price same as was mart price !</li>
            <li>It came quickly and packaged without any damages.</li>
            <li>Came quick just like promised ....</li>
            <li>I love elf brushes but, this particular product did not deliver what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>and I feel like there are better under eye powders that are concealers in it of themselves, and better under eye concealers that don&#x27;t require a specific setting powder, but rather</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried soooo many concealer setting powders from high end to drugstore,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>It goes on pretty smooth and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot.</li>
            <li>For me this product isn&#x27;t the best as I tend to have super dark bags under my eyes while it does liken them it doesn&#x27;t completely cover the bags.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with it and will continue using it on a daily basis, especially with the warm weather arriving!</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to be a disaster, but, somehow, when I apply this with a fluffy concealer brush (I use the new Flawless Concealer Brush from ELF)</li>
            <li>The fine lines don&#x27;t show nearly as much as they did.</li>
            <li>It is finely milled and very silky feeling.  </li>
            <li>Great item to hide those dark circles!</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t conceal anything and actually drew more attention to the fine lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I use it on my crows feet, smile lines and the &amp;#34;11&#x27;s&amp;#34; on my forehead.</li>
            <li>Such an effective way to keep eye make-up from melting into your undereye treatments and concealer.</li>
            <li>The bottle is much smaller than I expected but the product is excellent.</li>
            <li>Rarely use it.</li>
            <li>I apply my concealer, foundation, this then bronzer and i look awake and fresh.</li>
            <li>It is worth buying and i will continue to buy.</li>
            <li>Not really that good.</li>
            <li>but for $3 worth the try...</li>
            <li>other elf products like their blush and eye shadows are good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m even more impressed by how little product I require to create the &#x27;illusion&#x27; of less wrinkles.</li>
            <li>application was smooth, i could notice it did have decent coverage</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin looking HD ready and Soft focused , works great w regular foundation /concealer as well as w temptu airbrush foundations.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t look good on dark skin...</li>
            <li>This is a good product and does what it&#x27;s suppose to do in terms of dark eye coverage.</li>
            <li>I like the feel of the powder very much, but could do without the sparkle.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>Worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>I applied it for the first time</li>
            <li>Wow, this is fantastic.</li>
            <li>When i first put on it was shimmery under my eyes</li>
            <li>That being said I&#x27;m glad I did because actually like this product.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used an under eye concealing setting powder.</li>
            <li>Its a good setting powder, but it just has to much sparkle to be useful for an everyday look.</li>
            <li>and I find that it works better for setting the undereye area than either the translucent or corrective yellow HD powders from ELF.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well udner your eyes.</li>
            <li>This was my first purchase of this product.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting a bigger container and more in quantity.</li>
            <li>Really helps in setting under eye concealer and foundation!</li>
            <li>It is very light and sets to a satin finish, it really helps concealer by that extra step.</li>
            <li>Love this setting powder, the only thing preventing me from giving it 5 stars is that there&#x27;s so much glitter in the powder</li>
            <li>only negative is the brush that comes with it, I just use my ring finger to pat the product on and it works great!</li>
            <li>Sets undereye area very well, but there will most definitely be flashback in photos.</li>
            <li>The powder was in the original package, however, the package was not taped or sealed closed in any way, which is fine, aside from the fact it seems tampered with.</li>
            <li>Mine came with the brush shown put it was on the outside of the packaging and pretty easy to miss.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this would be good for &amp;#34;baking&amp;#34;, but I&#x27;ve yet to try to that with it.</li>
            <li>Looks nice, subtle, and is a nice final touch.</li>
            <li>The product goes on easy and blends in well takes so getting to used to on how to apply it properly.</li>
            <li>i will certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li>It makes it &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; and it makes me look a lot older than I am!</li>
            <li>The makeup does not seem to go on very well, with or without primer.</li>
            <li>It has so much glitter in it that it makes you under eye area look like you got hit with a glitter bomb</li>
            <li>I really like the product</li>
            <li>but it is very shiny.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s about all I can really say about this product.</li>
            <li>so the circles underneath can be very noticeable.</li>
            <li>The whole point of wearing concealer is to cover any imperfections in an area, not to draw attention to it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this product over others I have tried.  </li>
            <li>It really helps make</li>
            <li>Never would u think a powder would have such fabulous results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t have too much glitter or too matte.</li>
            <li>And, for the price, you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>It REALLY did help with darkness.</li>
            <li>Thanks ELF</li>
            <li>It really prevents raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li>but really I don&#x27;t even use it</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t apply the makeup very well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>This really really does work.  </li>
            <li>She loves it so much</li>
            <li>BUT NOT AS MUCH</li>
            <li>This setting powder does just what it&#x27;s supposed to do; it sets my undereye concealer very well.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel as smooth or have the glimmer, but does the same thing.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to this product.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much too sparkly.</li>
            <li>This setting powder has really helped.</li>
            <li>if u put too much u still can&#x27;t see it its</li>
            <li>It has a tiny bit of sparkle to it, so I use it over the light portion of my eye shadow.</li>
            <li>It really brightens the eye.</li>
            <li>I apply this after putting on my concealer and it sets it really well.</li>
            <li>I am a fan of some of the Elf brand products, and had read promising reviews (on Amazon) about this product, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li>I am really falling for E.L.F products.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really do much.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really notice a difference with this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very shimmery.</li>
            <li>but, when I do I really notice the difference.</li>
            <li>Nothing to really rave about here.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really see a difference.</li>
            <li>Shipping and delivery was fast and efficient.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give them a 3, I haven&#x27;t used it much</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>This one helps a bit, but doesn&#x27;t cover much on me</li>
            <li>And I do think it makes the area a little bit later because of the summer which looks very nice.</li>
            <li>I really love this product; however, a transparent loose face powder like NYC will do exactly the same thing &amp; you get a lot more for the same price.  </li>
            <li>Extremely sparkly do not recommend putting on unless makeup goes over the top</li>
            <li>This product is good for people who don&#x27;t have them to dark, but overall it helps me a bit</li>
            <li>If you use with concealer it works fantastic to keep it looking fresh all day without getting creases or eyeliner smearing down under your eyes.</li>
            <li>Small but nice, my eyes are poppin.</li>
            <li>this is by far the most useless make up I own</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work very well for me, it&#x27;s very light and pale...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m older and was having problems with my concealer settling in my wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Better than the more expensive brands Ive experimented with.</li>
            <li>It does have a glittery look to it when initially applied, but the glittery look disappears quickly after application.  </li>
            <li>Which I didn&#x27;t particularly like.</li>
            <li>The top of the box was dented and popped open which I assumed was from all the shipping, but when I opened it my brush was inside, and there is a slot on the outside of the box where it is intended to be.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li>So this is not for high melanin skin.  </li>
            <li>buy again and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It now stays clean for a long time</li>
            <li>I love this product i use it everyday</li>
            <li>Make sure to tap brush, so you don&#x27;t waste it.</li>
            <li>Normally I have to take make up and pat foundation on this area and keep patting it until its covered up.</li>
            <li>Even w the harsh lighting of my office, most days my circles don&#x27;t show thru.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I feel that because it&#x27;s such a lightweight and translucent type of powder, it helps to keep my undereye area looking fresh and not cakey.</li>
            <li>I look normal again.</li>
            <li>My makeup looks much better using my regular loose powder to set it.</li>
            <li>It looks white in the photo, but is actually a very light pink color.</li>
            <li>After reading some other reviews I think it&#x27;s important to note</li>
            <li>I liked this product, it gives a subtle sheen to my under eyes.</li>
            <li>I do like some ELF products, and tried this several ways as suggested on box- mixed in with cream as highlighter, and then tried to salvage as just light colored eye shadow/highlighter</li>
            <li>You can buy this same exact product at Target for $3.</li>
            <li>It conceals dark circles and brings light to your eyes.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>my first and last setting powder.</li>
            <li>I needed a product to help cover my dark circles under my eyes, ever since I had my little one my circles turned fairly darker.</li>
            <li>This stuff is really great - don&#x27;t be afraid of the tiny bit of sparkle, it doesn&#x27;t actually look sparkly, but the light reflecting quality helps with under eye circles.</li>
            <li>It is slightly rosy in color, with a light sheen.  </li>
            <li>Seems a little cakey to me and sets into my fine lines.  </li>
            <li>Maybe on lighter skin tones (I&#x27;m an NC50 for those familiar with MAC...or dark skinned for those who aren&#x27;t)</li>
            <li>I would definitely say less is more.</li>
            <li>Love the product, Its a little smaller than I thought it would be</li>
            <li>Im very amazed with this product and will buy again in future.</li>
            <li>Added a hint of powder to inner eye area and eyes really popped.</li>
            <li>Seems to work, so far.</li>
            <li>Early 50&#x27;s-career woman-dark circles.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 34yrs old</li>
            <li>and i get asked all the time when i&#x27;m with my 14yr old and 11yr old daughters if i&#x27;m their sister</li>
            <li>like u not putting anything u should be able to see at least something</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 38 years old</li>
            <li>This powder surprised me.  </li>
            <li>Good thing it wasn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
            <li>very smooth look...a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>The brush it comes with is absolutely useless; it&#x27;s more like a flat detailed liner/smudger brush.</li>
            <li>This may work better for those who do not have deep set eyes or daily dark circles, but if not I would recommend trying another product.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and soft with a fluffy brush not the one it comes with !</li>
            <li>Really helps to brighten up my eyes and works very well to conceal dark circles.</li>
            <li>For the price, this setting powder was exactly what I expected it to be.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not dark</li>
            <li>No pink at all!</li>
            <li>The brush is pretty useless, it&#x27;s a little too small for good, even, quick application of under eye powder - it would work well for foundation on a Barbie.  </li>
            <li>but you will have not spent a rediculous amount.</li>
            <li>I found it far far too sparkly with actual larger pieces of ?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a thin highlight.</li>
            <li>My only complaint would be that I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of loose powders because they get messy, but whatever, it works great</li>
            <li>its very small, but I only use it on special occasion; very very soft</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to score this little gem packaged with a tube of the ELF Tone Correcting Concealer for $2.99 at my local TJ Maxx.</li>
            <li>This works well, but it is a lot more sparkly than even the reviews had led me to believe, and as a person who generally prefers her makeup to be matte, it&#x27;s not ideal.</li>
            <li>The concealer powder is good, but it has an unnecessary purple glitter, which limits it for everyday use.</li>
            <li>The complementary brush is also too small to b useful.</li>
            <li>such a pity had high hopes for this product</li>
            <li>I need a powder around my eyes, so as long as it doesn&#x27;t make my wrinkles look worse as so many do, I will keep using it.</li>
            <li>There is a very minimal shimmer to this that serves as a high lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> but then I started noticing my make up staying in tact much longer and looking perfect from morning to night.</li>

            <li> It feels very smooth &amp; does have glimmer.  </li>
            <li> Very smooth application.  </li>
            <li> Since it was so cheap, I grabbed up the three that they had, and am soooooo glad I did!</li>
            <li> I just switched to mac prolong wear concealer but needed a nice setting powder to sit on top so makeup won&#x27;t sink in fine lines and smudge, etc.</li>
            <li> Such A Wonderful Product!!</li>
            <li> I love elf and all of their products.</li>
            <li> I use it on the top lid also.</li>
            <li> This product did not work well for me and did not provide coverage, even if I applied powdered foundation on top.</li>
            <li> I applied more powder and it still does not conceal anything.</li>
            <li> I have been avoiding putting any type of powder under my eyes because it seemed to make wrinkles more noticeable, this product doesn&#x27;t seem to do that</li>
            <li> Oh, how my wrinkles love this &#x27;Concealer&#x27;.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like freaking MAGIC.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> So worth the money really good quality.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of an undereye setting powder, but I&#x27;m not in love with this one.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love using this when I am in a hurry.  </li>
            <li> Does not do anything for concealing, but it works okay for making sure your make up doesn&#x27;t build up in the under eye area if you have creases there.</li>
            <li> and I love this product.</li>
            <li> all it takes to work its magic.</li>
            <li> It is not a concealer, but more of an eye highlighter/brightener.</li>
            <li> Even tried it on a stubborn age spot for coverage and worked better than a concealer.</li>
            <li> I will probably order more.</li>
            <li> BUT&lt;br /&gt;IT WORKS BETTER FOR ME WITH MY CONCEALER</li>
            <li> Looks awesome in pics, you get younger softer eyes !</li>
            <li> Maybe I was just expecting more than what this product delivered</li>
            <li> I think I was hoping for more of a highlighting effect - and that isn&#x27;t what this is supposed to be.</li>
            <li> Soo many girls on YouTube rave about this product, so i had to try it</li>
            <li> I might just start using contacts more often.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife and she is really satisfied with it</li>
            <li> Ok, So I knew this was a setting powder, but I did not expect the shimmer.</li>
            <li> I think I was expecting something more along the lines of the Ben Nye Luxury Powder...</li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> It is ok but needs to be reapplied</li>
            <li> Works better applied before concealer</li>
            <li> Love this concealer, it never cakes ..</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m so pleased</li>
            <li> ELF products are fabulous!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> I love this powder.  </li>
            <li> I do not know how thi looks on darker skin tones, but I would assume you would get more of a Jennifer Lopez look under your eyes.</li>
            <li> and I have more issues with wandering/melting mascara</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any magical brightening properties.</li>
            <li> There are a lot better brands out</li>
            <li> there - a bit more $, but</li>
            <li> It will not make your under eye circles look better.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know I had so many till using this powder.  </li>
            <li> love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
            <li> Item was a lot smaller that i anticipated yet the product itself made up for that with its wonderful application and coverage over my liquid highlighing concealers.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Accompanying brush and sifter top makes application easy and goof-proof.</li>
            <li> It filled in the nooks and crannies and I could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li> So glad I found this version of extremely good high quality HD powder !</li>
            <li> its a good product but for certain skin types</li>
            <li> I am very fair, and the powder is WHITE</li>
            <li> I apply this light powder on top of my concealer to set it in place.</li>
            <li> I love elf product its there cheap and they work</li>
            <li> Make sure your concealer is well blended to avoid it caking on into ur eye creases ,the color is perfect pearl to offset any dark circles or corrector concealer tones !</li>
            <li> It goes on so easily.</li>
            <li> Its so easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, too.</li>
            <li> A LOT, its drives them nuts but makes me feel younger and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I have dark circles under my eyes and when i use this product it looks like my face is flawless.</li>
            <li> It goes on fine</li>
            <li> I like the fine texture</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and easily.  </li>
            <li> This powder sets my undereye concealer and does not accent fine lines or wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> This powder seems to showcase fine lines.  </li>
            <li> This provides a light softening effect, while highlighting and setting concealer around your eyes.</li>
            <li> The color is too light.</li>
            <li> , I think it is because of the shimmer in it and therefore being light deflecting.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and clea</li>
            <li> It is feather light.</li>
            <li> As others have said in different reviews, the brush that comes with it isn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li> It sets and feels smooth, almost creamy.</li>
            <li> Great for white women though.</li>
            <li> I added this to my cart to qualify for free shipping ($3 Add-on item).</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but felt like it was worth a try since it&#x27;s so inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I only have to apply this in the morning and still looks great at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> It was exactly as advertised!!</li>
            <li> I recommend rolling the brush across your under eye area then pat and lightly blend this setting powder all around your whole eye and on top of your top level eye shadow near the brow and inner eye corners for a flawless look !</li>
            <li> I am just being honest and this is my opinion on this particular product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get rid of the lines, but it sure masks them very, very well.</li>
            <li> It comes with a small brush that is perfect for the job.</li>
            <li> WORTH THE WAIT!</li>
            <li> It simply makes everything look natural, but flawless.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty cool, It goes on easy an super easy to blend out.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s my fair skin, or maybe I used a smaller amount.</li>
            <li> Love that it keeps my under eye concealer set in place throughout the day but could really do without the glittery effect it gives.</li>
            <li> Love this for setting under the eyes, works really well.</li>
            <li> Any kind of fine line instantly disappears!</li>
            <li> Great product was as expected!</li>
            <li> I have used other e.l.f. products and have been happy with the results but not in this case.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Seller was fast and great price same as was mart price !</li>
            <li> It came quickly and packaged without any damages.</li>
            <li> Came quick just like promised ....</li>
            <li> I love elf brushes but, this particular product did not deliver what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> and I feel like there are better under eye powders that are concealers in it of themselves, and better under eye concealers that don&#x27;t require a specific setting powder, but rather</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried soooo many concealer setting powders from high end to drugstore,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> It goes on pretty smooth and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot.</li>
            <li> For me this product isn&#x27;t the best as I tend to have super dark bags under my eyes while it does liken them it doesn&#x27;t completely cover the bags.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with it and will continue using it on a daily basis, especially with the warm weather arriving!</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to be a disaster, but, somehow, when I apply this with a fluffy concealer brush (I use the new Flawless Concealer Brush from ELF)</li>
            <li> The fine lines don&#x27;t show nearly as much as they did.</li>
            <li> It is finely milled and very silky feeling.  </li>
            <li> Great item to hide those dark circles!</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t conceal anything and actually drew more attention to the fine lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I use it on my crows feet, smile lines and the &amp;#34;11&#x27;s&amp;#34; on my forehead.</li>
            <li> Such an effective way to keep eye make-up from melting into your undereye treatments and concealer.</li>
            <li> The bottle is much smaller than I expected but the product is excellent.</li>
            <li> Rarely use it.</li>
            <li> I apply my concealer, foundation, this then bronzer and i look awake and fresh.</li>
            <li> It is worth buying and i will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Not really that good.</li>
            <li> but for $3 worth the try...</li>
            <li> other elf products like their blush and eye shadows are good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m even more impressed by how little product I require to create the &#x27;illusion&#x27; of less wrinkles.</li>
            <li> application was smooth, i could notice it did have decent coverage</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin looking HD ready and Soft focused , works great w regular foundation /concealer as well as w temptu airbrush foundations.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t look good on dark skin...</li>
            <li> This is a good product and does what it&#x27;s suppose to do in terms of dark eye coverage.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of the powder very much, but could do without the sparkle.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> I applied it for the first time</li>
            <li> Wow, this is fantastic.</li>
            <li> When i first put on it was shimmery under my eyes</li>
            <li> That being said I&#x27;m glad I did because actually like this product.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used an under eye concealing setting powder.</li>
            <li> Its a good setting powder, but it just has to much sparkle to be useful for an everyday look.</li>
            <li> and I find that it works better for setting the undereye area than either the translucent or corrective yellow HD powders from ELF.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well udner your eyes.</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase of this product.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting a bigger container and more in quantity.</li>
            <li> Really helps in setting under eye concealer and foundation!</li>
            <li> It is very light and sets to a satin finish, it really helps concealer by that extra step.</li>
            <li> Love this setting powder, the only thing preventing me from giving it 5 stars is that there&#x27;s so much glitter in the powder</li>
            <li> only negative is the brush that comes with it, I just use my ring finger to pat the product on and it works great!</li>
            <li> Sets undereye area very well, but there will most definitely be flashback in photos.</li>
            <li> The powder was in the original package, however, the package was not taped or sealed closed in any way, which is fine, aside from the fact it seems tampered with.</li>
            <li> Mine came with the brush shown put it was on the outside of the packaging and pretty easy to miss.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this would be good for &amp;#34;baking&amp;#34;, but I&#x27;ve yet to try to that with it.</li>
            <li> Looks nice, subtle, and is a nice final touch.</li>
            <li> The product goes on easy and blends in well takes so getting to used to on how to apply it properly.</li>
            <li> i will certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li> It makes it &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; and it makes me look a lot older than I am!</li>
            <li> The makeup does not seem to go on very well, with or without primer.</li>
            <li> It has so much glitter in it that it makes you under eye area look like you got hit with a glitter bomb</li>
            <li> I really like the product</li>
            <li> but it is very shiny.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s about all I can really say about this product.</li>
            <li> so the circles underneath can be very noticeable.</li>
            <li> The whole point of wearing concealer is to cover any imperfections in an area, not to draw attention to it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this product over others I have tried.  </li>
            <li> It really helps make</li>
            <li> Never would u think a powder would have such fabulous results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t have too much glitter or too matte.</li>
            <li> And, for the price, you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> It REALLY did help with darkness.</li>
            <li> Thanks ELF</li>
            <li> It really prevents raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> but really I don&#x27;t even use it</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t apply the makeup very well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This really really does work.  </li>
            <li> She loves it so much</li>
            <li> BUT NOT AS MUCH</li>
            <li> This setting powder does just what it&#x27;s supposed to do; it sets my undereye concealer very well.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel as smooth or have the glimmer, but does the same thing.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to this product.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much too sparkly.</li>
            <li> This setting powder has really helped.</li>
            <li> if u put too much u still can&#x27;t see it its</li>
            <li> It has a tiny bit of sparkle to it, so I use it over the light portion of my eye shadow.</li>
            <li> It really brightens the eye.</li>
            <li> I apply this after putting on my concealer and it sets it really well.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of some of the Elf brand products, and had read promising reviews (on Amazon) about this product, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> I am really falling for E.L.F products.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do much.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really notice a difference with this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very shimmery.</li>
            <li> but, when I do I really notice the difference.</li>
            <li> Nothing to really rave about here.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really see a difference.</li>
            <li> Shipping and delivery was fast and efficient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give them a 3, I haven&#x27;t used it much</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> This one helps a bit, but doesn&#x27;t cover much on me</li>
            <li> And I do think it makes the area a little bit later because of the summer which looks very nice.</li>
            <li> I really love this product; however, a transparent loose face powder like NYC will do exactly the same thing &amp; you get a lot more for the same price.  </li>
            <li> Extremely sparkly do not recommend putting on unless makeup goes over the top</li>
            <li> This product is good for people who don&#x27;t have them to dark, but overall it helps me a bit</li>
            <li> If you use with concealer it works fantastic to keep it looking fresh all day without getting creases or eyeliner smearing down under your eyes.</li>
            <li> Small but nice, my eyes are poppin.</li>
            <li> this is by far the most useless make up I own</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work very well for me, it&#x27;s very light and pale...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m older and was having problems with my concealer settling in my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Better than the more expensive brands Ive experimented with.</li>
            <li> It does have a glittery look to it when initially applied, but the glittery look disappears quickly after application.  </li>
            <li> Which I didn&#x27;t particularly like.</li>
            <li> The top of the box was dented and popped open which I assumed was from all the shipping, but when I opened it my brush was inside, and there is a slot on the outside of the box where it is intended to be.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> So this is not for high melanin skin.  </li>
            <li> buy again and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It now stays clean for a long time</li>
            <li> I love this product i use it everyday</li>
            <li> Make sure to tap brush, so you don&#x27;t waste it.</li>
            <li> Normally I have to take make up and pat foundation on this area and keep patting it until its covered up.</li>
            <li> Even w the harsh lighting of my office, most days my circles don&#x27;t show thru.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I feel that because it&#x27;s such a lightweight and translucent type of powder, it helps to keep my undereye area looking fresh and not cakey.</li>
            <li> I look normal again.</li>
            <li> My makeup looks much better using my regular loose powder to set it.</li>
            <li> It looks white in the photo, but is actually a very light pink color.</li>
            <li> After reading some other reviews I think it&#x27;s important to note</li>
            <li> I liked this product, it gives a subtle sheen to my under eyes.</li>
            <li> I do like some ELF products, and tried this several ways as suggested on box- mixed in with cream as highlighter, and then tried to salvage as just light colored eye shadow/highlighter</li>
            <li> You can buy this same exact product at Target for $3.</li>
            <li> It conceals dark circles and brings light to your eyes.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> my first and last setting powder.</li>
            <li> I needed a product to help cover my dark circles under my eyes, ever since I had my little one my circles turned fairly darker.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really great - don&#x27;t be afraid of the tiny bit of sparkle, it doesn&#x27;t actually look sparkly, but the light reflecting quality helps with under eye circles.</li>
            <li> It is slightly rosy in color, with a light sheen.  </li>
            <li> Seems a little cakey to me and sets into my fine lines.  </li>
            <li> Maybe on lighter skin tones (I&#x27;m an NC50 for those familiar with MAC...or dark skinned for those who aren&#x27;t)</li>
            <li> I would definitely say less is more.</li>
            <li> Love the product, Its a little smaller than I thought it would be</li>
            <li> Im very amazed with this product and will buy again in future.</li>
            <li> Added a hint of powder to inner eye area and eyes really popped.</li>
            <li> Seems to work, so far.</li>
            <li> Early 50&#x27;s-career woman-dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 34yrs old</li>
            <li> and i get asked all the time when i&#x27;m with my 14yr old and 11yr old daughters if i&#x27;m their sister</li>
            <li> like u not putting anything u should be able to see at least something</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 38 years old</li>
            <li> This powder surprised me.  </li>
            <li> Good thing it wasn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
            <li> very smooth look...a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The brush it comes with is absolutely useless; it&#x27;s more like a flat detailed liner/smudger brush.</li>
            <li> This may work better for those who do not have deep set eyes or daily dark circles, but if not I would recommend trying another product.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and soft with a fluffy brush not the one it comes with !</li>
            <li> Really helps to brighten up my eyes and works very well to conceal dark circles.</li>
            <li> For the price, this setting powder was exactly what I expected it to be.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not dark</li>
            <li> No pink at all!</li>
            <li> The brush is pretty useless, it&#x27;s a little too small for good, even, quick application of under eye powder - it would work well for foundation on a Barbie.  </li>
            <li> but you will have not spent a rediculous amount.</li>
            <li> I found it far far too sparkly with actual larger pieces of ?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like a thin highlight.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of loose powders because they get messy, but whatever, it works great</li>
            <li> its very small, but I only use it on special occasion; very very soft</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to score this little gem packaged with a tube of the ELF Tone Correcting Concealer for $2.99 at my local TJ Maxx.</li>
            <li> This works well, but it is a lot more sparkly than even the reviews had led me to believe, and as a person who generally prefers her makeup to be matte, it&#x27;s not ideal.</li>
            <li> The concealer powder is good, but it has an unnecessary purple glitter, which limits it for everyday use.</li>
            <li> The complementary brush is also too small to b useful.</li>
            <li> such a pity had high hopes for this product</li>
            <li> I need a powder around my eyes, so as long as it doesn&#x27;t make my wrinkles look worse as so many do, I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> There is a very minimal shimmer to this that serves as a high lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I wanted to try this since I am much older now and every little trick for women of my age</li>
            <li> I use it very sparingly so a little does go a long way.  </li>
            <li> Although I like this product, I&#x27;m not sure it does much of a difference compared to my face HD translucent powder or the yellow translucent powder.  </li>
            <li> Only takes a tiny bit, so it lasts a long time at an inexpensive price.  </li>
            <li> the product even though small is very generous</li>
            <li> So, unless you&#x27;re looking for a loose powder eye shadow with white sparkle, (this would definitely work for that use)</li>
            <li> This will go a long way.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve had a rough night and need some help the next morning</li>
            <li> Smaller the what I expected</li>
            <li> A normal translucent powder, pressed powder, or loose powder applied with a small brush would suffice.</li>
            <li> so going through expensive HD powders is not so much fun !</li>
            <li> In other reviews people had mentioned there was shimmer, it is not shimmer, there are actual RAINBOW sparkles.</li>
            <li> It did not seem to stay on my skin very long either.</li>
            <li> At first I thought this product was really pointless and without use (waste of money)</li>
            <li> I use a lighter cream to powder foundation, i put loose powder over it and finish it with this product and</li>
            <li> It literally is just a transparent loose setting powder.</li>
            <li> Like this product helps with my concealer jst to small next time need to buy two or see tgey sell bigger bottle</li>
            <li> I will just go back to setting my concealer with my all over face powder which seems to work just as well and will save me money, time and less layers on my face.</li>
            <li> but it certainly hasn&#x27;t made them look worse and now that summer is here</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Well, no, not really.  </li>
            <li> I am always skeptical about buying an item over the internet i know knothing about,but this product is worth it.</li>
            <li> Got this 6 days before the expected date.</li>
            <li> It does have some sparkly sheen going on, but if you&#x27;re subtle with how much powder you apply and don&#x27;t go heavy handed, then it shouldn&#x27;t be an issue.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that its really really small and the brush super small and hard.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and what a difference it makes with &#x27;Mother Time&#x27;.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> a little goes a long way with this powder</li>
            <li> all you see is shimmer and a very little bit of white.</li>
            <li> It is very little product, I think you get the same results using the elf face primer.</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount per application.</li>
            <li> but a little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> I have other brushes and for the price</li>
            <li> but I did one eye and not the other and the effect was definitive and noticeable.  </li>
            <li> My son asked if somebody had hit my other eye (the one that didn&#x27;t have the concealer on it).</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t purchase this again because although it is only $3, it is so small</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This one I could have spent the cash a lot smarter!</li>
            <li> I see only a small disadvantage -</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the container is so small do product doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not really interested in making my bags and dark circles shine.</li>
            <li> The brush is small but you wouldn&#x27;t want a larger one because this gets into those little creases.</li>
            <li> The brush also had hard white things (?)</li>
            <li> It helps cover my dark circles.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s totally not worth $7.</li>
            <li> I have dark circles</li>
            <li> Is like an eyeshadow, brillant invisible but dont&#x27;t hide the undereyes dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It has lasting power too at least 8 hours .</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this to my dark skin sistas, but at this price if you are lighter complexioned, I&#x27;d give it a shot.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t conceal any dark circles under the eyes...</li>
            <li> but if you have dark ones go for a cream or liquid product.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for anyone who has dark circles under the eyes.</li>
            <li> so idk if I am using it wrong or what, but I don&#x27;t really like it</li>
            <li> only complaint is that it is elf size.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be going fast.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> After applying foundation, use concealer on dark circles under eyes then place setting powder in a V-shape.</li>
            <li> I do have dark circles under my eyes though.</li>
            <li> After applying foundation, use concealer on dark circles under eyes then place setting powder in a V-shape.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been confused for my 21 year old co-worker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very light completed</li>
            <li> only problem is that this is very small but we don&#x27;t need to put alot of it anyway just a dab will do.</li>
            <li> it makes my under eye concealer look less cakey.</li>
            <li> There is a slight glitter in the product, which I also did not like.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> this would be complementary, but it just looks odd on me.</li>
            <li> not what i expected the brush is not helpful at all its very messy cap on mine is messed up.</li>
            <li> I put a little highlighter on under and around my eyes then seal it with the powder, and I look like I had a luxurious 10 hours of sleep even when I am running on about 5.  </li>
            <li> Just a little bit&lt;br /&gt;is</li>
            <li> I would recommended this product to all my friends that need a little help under your eyes...</li>
            <li> Gives a little shimmer which brightens the eyes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the little shine but for some it might be a problem.  </li>
            <li> I think I can also use this alone for the days that I don&#x27;t have concealer on just to brighten up my under eye area a little bit.</li>
            <li> A little shimmery,</li>
            <li> After opening it the lid looked a little shimmery (see pic)</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s just because my under eyes circles are very dark.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday .</li>
            <li> I was having trouble finding something that would not show that.</li>
            <li> Waste of money and will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I always have trouble with my eyeliner somehow ending up underneath my eyes as the day progresses.</li>
            <li> The brush in the pic does not come with it - or at least I didn&#x27;t get one, but was not really an issue for me.  </li>
            <li> I use e.l.f everyday and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this has worked any wonders for my dark circles</li>
            <li> so I could wear it for everyday</li>
            <li> I do not use it everyday</li>
            <li> and I use a fluffy mini kabuki brush with this powder.</li>
            <li> I use a big fluffy brush to apply a thin layer under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> No more creasing under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Not perfectly but adds a bit of coverage to my current concealer and helps it stay put.</li>
            <li> The brush this came with was extremely small.</li>
            <li> However I am not sure how well it will work if you have alot to conceal.</li>
            <li> Not sure what this is suppose to do</li>
            <li> Too small didn&#x27;t see the point</li>
            <li> I just use a small domed brush when I apply it.  </li>
            <li> It just takes a small amount.</li>
            <li> However the brush is extremely small.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure it did anything it claims to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I can notice a difference when using this either for setting for for HD highlighting.  </li>
            <li> Extremely small, and no brush came with my product.</li>
            <li> but comes in a small bottle</li>
            <li> the package is too small.</li>
            <li> Yet, I wanted to put in my two cents because I have read the reviews, and it seems people either love it or hate it!</li>
            <li> Does not conceal anything, just makes it look shiny and very pale.</li>
            <li> DRIES OUT AND GETS HARD</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rock hard and doesn&#x27;t blend anything.</li>
            <li> The brush that comes with it sucks.  </li>
            <li> Start with a small amount of product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and never came with the brush!</li>
            <li> It is very small and does not have a lot of powder in it</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s very small like sample size.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this because when you look at it closely you&#x27;ll see that it has a shimmer and that it&#x27;s actually a little bit rosy in color.</li>
            <li> The only thing bad about this is that the brush doesn&#x27;t look anything like the one in the picture.</li>
            <li> Also to me the brush is small almost to the point that it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not great, could be worse..</li>
            <li> The brush sucks!!</li>
            <li> IMO the brush is useless which is why I gave it four stars.</li>
            <li> Worse product ever!  </li>
            <li> It might have not been to expensive</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this concealer does nothing.  </li>
            <li> If it does not do as I have mentioned I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> I ordered it being skeptical</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed at all, I have lighter skin and this was like adding nothing.  </li>
            <li> WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO APPLY,</li>
            <li> Completely useless.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m officially in my 60&#x27;s, I desperately needed something that would &#x27;deflect&#x27; my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a night owl and believe me under my eyes in the morning is bad.  </li>
            <li> glitter that I was trying to pick off and ended up looking so bad</li>
            <li> My bad.  </li>
            <li> I saw some reviews that said the shimmer was bad, but its not I couldn&#x27;t tell it had shimmer when I put it under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Over all, disappointed.</li>
            <li> But I have to say I&#x27;m disappointed.  </li>
            <li> you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> :-(  </li>
            <li> this crap didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> and I HATE glitter, but it works</li>
            <li> horrible..</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Terrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I don&#x27;t look good on dark skin...</li>
            <li> Great product was as expected!</li>
            <li> This works well, but it is a lot more sparkly than even the reviews had led me to believe, and as a person who generally prefers her makeup to be matte, it&#x27;s not ideal. Also to me the brush is small almost to the point that it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> This product kept my concealer from wearing away for the 6 hours I was at an event. IMO the brush is useless which is why I gave it four stars. I used my finger and it worked great.</li>
            <li> This provides a light softening effect, while highlighting and setting concealer around your eyes. I am VERY happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Such A Wonderful Product!! It was exactly as advertised!! Couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase!! I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a powder to replace my liquid highlighter because it kept rubbing off, but this helped fix that problem anyway!</li>
            <li> Even with face and under eye primer, this still creases and increases the visibility of wrinkles under eyes. I tried to do a before and after and notice no difference between the eye that has this one and the one that doesn&#x27;t. Won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> The makeup does not seem to go on very well, with or without primer. I would not order again. Not what I expected.I would not order again.</li>
            <li> This was not what I was expecting at all. It has so much glitter in it that it makes you under eye area look like you got hit with a glitter bomb</li>
            <li> Good product. Great size and price</li>
            <li> I really like the product but it is very shiny. That&#x27;s about all I can really say about this product.</li>
            <li> its very small, but I only use it on special occasion; very very soft</li>
            <li> Love this!!!!! I put it on before foundation. I use it on my crows feet, smile lines and the &amp;#34;11&#x27;s&amp;#34; on my forehead. It doesn&#x27;t get rid of the lines, but it sure masks them very, very well. I definitely recommend this product and will buy it again!</li>
            <li> Er zitten glitters is dat vond k wat minder fijn</li>
            <li> What a great item! Great quality and great price! I love elf and all of their products. Makes your eyes look awesome!</li>
            <li> Such an effective way to keep eye make-up from melting into your undereye treatments and concealer. Accompanying brush and sifter top makes application easy and goof-proof. Leaves an air-brushed effect and can be reapplied without buildup.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly. No more creasing under my eyes. I use it on the top lid also. The only problem is it is not translucent. It shows up whitish. I solve the problem by going over it with a skin tone powder.</li>
            <li> The brush sucks!! It makes the undereye area look cakey.</li>
            <li> This product is good at setting your concealer. It is very light and sets to a satin finish, it really helps concealer by that extra step. Has a tiny bit of sparkle, shimmer, whatever you want to call it to it but isn&#x27;t noticeable (to me).</li>
            <li> Worse product ever!  It might have not been to expensive but it didn&#x27;t do what it said it would or what others have said it would.. Definitely not going by reviews anymore bc this crap didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> To be honest, this product did not work well for me. I have deep set eyes so the circles underneath can be very noticeable. This product did not work well for me and did not provide coverage, even if I applied powdered foundation on top. It did not seem to stay on my skin very long either. This may work better for those who do not have deep set eyes or daily dark circles, but if not I would recommend trying another product.  I have used other e.l.f. products and have been happy with the results but not in this case. I will not be purchasing this again in the future.</li>
            <li> not what i expected the brush is not helpful at all its very messy cap on mine is messed up. Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> My kohl used to smudge a lot and now I can see a visible difference after I apply this product. It now stays clean for a long time</li>
            <li> It helps cover my dark circles. Not perfectly but adds a bit of coverage to my current concealer and helps it stay put. FYI- You can buy this same exact product at Target for $3.</li>
            <li> Ok. While this is a fairly good idea... it&#x27;s totally not worth $7. A normal translucent powder, pressed powder, or loose powder applied with a small brush would suffice. Also, it&#x27;s SPARKLY. What? No! The whole point of wearing concealer is to cover any imperfections in an area, not to draw attention to it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the brush is poopy.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this concealer does nothing.  I have fair skin and I applied this under my eyes and it did not make a difference at all. I applied more powder and it still does not conceal anything. The color is too light. No refunds/returns and will not buy again</li>
            <li> For the price, this setting powder was exactly what I expected it to be.  It is slightly rosy in color, with a light sheen.  I prefer matte powders, but it does its job without clumping.</li>
            <li> I really like this product over others I have tried.  I have been avoiding putting any type of powder under my eyes because it seemed to make wrinkles more noticeable, this product doesn&#x27;t seem to do that, I think it is because of the shimmer in it and therefore being light deflecting.  I use it very sparingly so a little does go a long way.  Works well to set under eye concealer.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. The bottle is much smaller than I expected but the product is excellent. The brush is included. I&#x27;m older and was having problems with my concealer settling in my wrinkles. I thought I&#x27;d give this product a try. The price is great so why not. I love this stuff! It really helps make my under eye area look smoother. The fine lines don&#x27;t show nearly as much as they did. It only takes a small amount per application. I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This product is so great. Just use the brush provided and the result will please us greatly. It goes on smooth and clea</li>
            <li> Oh, how my wrinkles love this &#x27;Concealer&#x27;. It&#x27;s like freaking MAGIC. A little goes a long way and what a difference it makes with &#x27;Mother Time&#x27;. Now that I&#x27;m officially in my 60&#x27;s, I desperately needed something that would &#x27;deflect&#x27; my wrinkles. It goes on so easily. I admit, I was reluctant to think this would actually work. I&#x27;m even more impressed by how little product I require to create the &#x27;illusion&#x27; of less wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I apply this light powder on top of my concealer to set it in place. I am pleased with it and will continue using it on a daily basis, especially with the warm weather arriving!</li>
            <li> I always had issues with my under eye concealer bleeding into my under eye lines. But this holds it in place but doesn&#x27;t make my concealer look &amp;#34;caked&amp;#34; on. It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Never would u think a powder would have such fabulous results. I am78 and never thought this would work.  Did not make creases loook deeper but almost invisible.  Elf is a great product.  Don&#x27;t be thrown off by the low prices.  Love it. If it does not do as I have mentioned I&#x27;m sorry but you will have not spent a rediculous amount.</li>
            <li> I love this it makes my under eye concealer look less cakey.</li>
            <li> So worth the money really good quality.</li>
            <li> Product is so so. Rarely use it.</li>
            <li> Did not receive my brush</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a great product. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t have too much glitter or too matte. And, for the price, you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Very good product.. The only thing bad about this is that the brush doesn&#x27;t look anything like the one in the picture. The brush this came with was extremely small.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of an undereye setting powder, but I&#x27;m not in love with this one.  It goes on fine and I would use it except that there is legitimately glitter in it.  It makes me feel like a 90s middle schooler all over again.</li>
            <li> very nice and translucent</li>
            <li> I like this concealer. It conceals without looking .like you have put anything on. However I am not sure how well it will work if you have alot to conceal.</li>
            <li> Not sure what this is suppose to do</li>
            <li> Worked pretty well. Still had some mascara to smear.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like this product&#x27;s performance at all. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> It REALLY did help with darkness. I apply my concealer, foundation, this then bronzer and i look awake and fresh. Makes pictures look better as well!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make a difference or make my makeup last longer</li>
            <li> Love it. I use it everyday . With or without foundation.</li>
            <li> I love how smooth this powder is!!!  It is very small and does not have a lot of powder in it but a little goes a long way!  I love using this when I am in a hurry.  I put a little highlighter on under and around my eyes then seal it with the powder, and I look like I had a luxurious 10 hours of sleep even when I am running on about 5.  I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Does not do anything for concealing, but it works okay for making sure your make up doesn&#x27;t build up in the under eye area if you have creases there. There is a slight glitter in the product, which I also did not like. Over all, disappointed.</li>
            <li> Gives brighten around the eyes without being glittery.  Very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work very well for me, it&#x27;s very light and pale... it even makes my undereyes seem darker when I put it... I prefer not using it.</li>
            <li> I would buy this product if you have issues with makeup coming off under your eyes and if you need additional lightness under your eyes.  I have dark circles and I love this product.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I found it by accident and let me tell you it was the best accident yet. I use to wear a lot of concealer over the years and that has created creases under my eyes. I was having trouble finding something that would not show that. This product not only disappears in seconds, but it hides all my wrinkles under my eye. I no longer use concealer. I use a lighter cream to powder foundation, i put loose powder over it and finish it with this product and it last all day. Even after a sweaty work out. Thanks ELF</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this it&#x27;s like wearing glitter under ur eyes such a pity had high hopes for this product</li>
            <li> Best undereye setting powder!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell a difference</li>
            <li> This setting powder is really good. It doesn&#x27;t cake up, showing creases and it also lightens.</li>
            <li> The concealer powder is good, but it has an unnecessary purple glitter, which limits it for everyday use. The complementary brush is also too small to b useful.</li>
            <li> Too small didn&#x27;t see the point</li>
            <li> I ordered it being skeptical but I wanted to try this since I am much older now and every little trick for women of my age helps.&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise I applied it for the first time and I sold on it!!! It does work and helps with the lines under my eyes. Just a little bit&lt;br /&gt;is all it takes to work its magic. It comes with a small brush that is perfect for the job. I would recommended this product to all my friends that need a little help under your eyes... I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this cause I&#x27;m a night owl and believe me under my eyes in the morning is bad.  I like the fine texture and I even use it on my upper eyelid.  It really prevents raccoon eyes. People don&#x27;t like the brush but really I don&#x27;t even use it I have other brushes and for the price I think it&#x27;s a great find.</li>
            <li> This is the best under eye concealer that I have used. It is feather light. It conceals dark circles and brings light to your eyes. I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I love this product i use it everyday</li>
            <li> This does nothing, I wear it sometimes, and I can see no difference, I don&#x27;t like this product, and I don&#x27;t think anyone should buy it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff! It&#x27;s a great highlighter for the under eye area, and gives your skin a smooth silky feel. It looks white in the photo, but is actually a very light pink color. When you put it on, it&#x27;s almost translucent all you see is shimmer and a very little bit of white. No pink at all! As others have said in different reviews, the brush that comes with it isn&#x27;t that great. It&#x27;s small and pretty much useless. It doesn&#x27;t apply the makeup very well. I just use a small domed brush when I apply it.  I love this setting powder and when I run out I will be buying more! I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I liked this product, it gives a subtle sheen to my under eyes. I did not experience the hint of blue sheen once the product was applied. Maybe it&#x27;s my fair skin, or maybe I used a smaller amount. I would definitely say less is more. Start with a small amount of product! My concealer stayed in place, and I happily continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Keeps my concealer in place and helps minimize creasing, Love it! I use a larger brush than the one they provide, but I&#x27;ll definitely keep purchasing!</li>
            <li> Honestly this was amazing. i loved it. Its so easy to apply. only problem is that this is very small but we don&#x27;t need to put alot of it anyway just a dab will do. Im very amazed with this product and will buy again in future.</li>
            <li> Mine did not come with a brush. However, I just apply it with a rounded eye shadow brush. This powder Is amazing.  It just takes a small amount. Make sure to tap brush, so you don&#x27;t waste it. It sets and feels smooth, almost creamy. I use it underneath and in the corners by my nose. It is not a concealer, but more of an eye highlighter/brightener. I&#x27;m very pleased with the product and will continue to purchase this!! Even buying one for my sister.</li>
            <li> I thought this color may be too light/white, but when I put it on it blended perfectly to my concealer color. Gives a little shimmer which brightens the eyes. It filled in the nooks and crannies and I could not be more pleased. Added a hint of powder to inner eye area and eyes really popped. The brush is small but you wouldn&#x27;t want a larger one because this gets into those little creases. Even tried it on a stubborn age spot for coverage and worked better than a concealer. There&#x27;s a lot of product in the bottle so don&#x27;t be deceived by the size. This will go a long way.</li>
            <li> Is not usefull. Is like an eyeshadow, brillant invisible but dont&#x27;t hide the undereyes dark circles. I don&#x27;t recomend this product.</li>
            <li> it works beautifully!  I am in LOVE with ELF products!!!  I purchase nothing but them now.  This really really does work.  I had to apply several coats but I did one eye and not the other and the effect was definitive and noticeable.  My son asked if somebody had hit my other eye (the one that didn&#x27;t have the concealer on it). I suffer from constant allergy shiners and this actually worked to cover them up!  DEFINITELY RECOMMEND! WORTH THE WAIT!</li>
            <li> work well with the e.l.f. under eye concealer! I had tried lot of brands and this one is the most amazing one!</li>
            <li> Second day I have used this product. Seems to work, so far.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty cool, It goes on easy an super easy to blend out. Better than the more expensive brands Ive experimented with.</li>
            <li> I like the powder but I don&#x27;t like the container. I spilled the powder a couple of times.</li>
            <li> I have dark circles under my eyes. Normally I have to take make up and pat foundation on this area and keep patting it until its covered up. This concealer is wonderful, So easy to work with. I will probably order more.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fiancee and it came in the mail today. She loves it so much and she swears by it! I can tell myself, definitely a recommendation!</li>
            <li> I LIKE THIS IT HELPS ME OUT BUT NOT AS MUCH AS I THOUGHT FOR THE UNDEREYE LNES UGH BUT&lt;br /&gt;IT WORKS BETTER FOR ME WITH MY CONCEALER</li>
            <li> Love this setting powder beautiful skin tone pearly non glittery luminous setting powder , Better than makeup forever HD setting powder / Bobbie brown setting powder ! Leaves my skin looking HD ready and Soft focused , works great w regular foundation /concealer as well as w temptu airbrush foundations. Goes on smooth and soft with a fluffy brush not the one it comes with ! I recommend rolling the brush across your under eye area then pat and lightly blend this setting powder all around your whole eye and on top of your top level eye shadow near the brow and inner eye corners for a flawless look ! Make sure your concealer is well blended to avoid it caking on into ur eye creases ,the color is perfect pearl to offset any dark circles or corrector concealer tones ! Looks awesome in pics, you get younger softer eyes ! It has lasting power too at least 8 hours . I love using the ELF face setting HD powder as well , but this is grand for under you eye ! Seller was fast and great price same as was mart price ! I am a sephora girl but I use a lot of Makeup daily ( just my preference) so going through expensive HD powders is not so much fun ! So glad I found this version of extremely good high quality HD powder ! I would also suggest using HD PRIMER as it helps to use the same line ! Try it you will love it ! I included pics w out makeup , one w regular makeup without the product where you can see wrinkles and the two with the product one indoors and one outdoors so you can see how it looks in diff lighting ! Love this stuff !</li>
            <li> This setting powder does just what it&#x27;s supposed to do; it sets my undereye concealer very well.  My concealer doesn&#x27;t look cakey at the end of the day. A little goes a long way.  It feels very smooth &amp; does have glimmer.  The brush that comes with it sucks.  I really love this product; however, a transparent loose face powder like NYC will do exactly the same thing &amp; you get a lot more for the same price.  Doesn&#x27;t feel as smooth or have the glimmer, but does the same thing.</li>
            <li> Maybe I was just expecting more than what this product delivered but I did not see any point of using this product, because it did not concealer anything.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve had a rough night and need some help the next morning then this is for you. It goes on pretty smooth and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a shimmery translucent.  Well, no, not really.  So this is not for high melanin skin.  Great for white women though.</li>
            <li> I love elf product its there cheap and they work</li>
            <li> works very good really like it.</li>
            <li> Wow!  This works!  Early 50&#x27;s-career woman-dark circles.  I wanted to try this extra step in my makeup regime to see if the brightening step might work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a word - YES!  I pat it on over concealer w a larger brush I had, then pat my mineral foundation over it all. Even w the harsh lighting of my office, most days my circles don&#x27;t show thru.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This does not set my concealer at all. It makes it &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; and it makes me look a lot older than I am! My makeup looks much better using my regular loose powder to set it.</li>
            <li> Small but nice, my eyes are poppin. I love all E.L.F. products, forever sold! Ladies, Try ALL their products, you&#x27;ll fall inlove. I&#x27;m 34yrs old and i get asked all the time when i&#x27;m with my 14yr old and 11yr old daughters if i&#x27;m their sister, i couldn&#x27;t be their mother, i look about 24/25..... i&#x27;m full of smiles, great to hear and we hear it A LOT, its drives them nuts but makes me feel younger and beautiful. Thank You E.L.F</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to this product. But I have to say I&#x27;m disappointed.  It&#x27;s has gold undertones and it&#x27;s much too sparkly. I wanted to use this as described to set my under eye concealer but it&#x27;s too sparkly to set. It&#x27;s more like a thin highlight. I&#x27;m not very light completed but I&#x27;m not dark and it actually makes my undereyes look bruised. Good thing it wasn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
            <li> Seems a little cakey to me and sets into my fine lines.  I think I was hoping for more of a highlighting effect - and that isn&#x27;t what this is supposed to be.</li>
            <li> Soo many girls on YouTube rave about this product, so i had to try it, I&#x27;m not one to use foundation on the regular but with this product in hand I might just start using contacts more often.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like this at all. Doesn&#x27;t do anything for me. Waste of money and will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I always have trouble with my eyeliner somehow ending up underneath my eyes as the day progresses. This setting powder has really helped. It is very fine and undetectable.  Only takes a tiny bit, so it lasts a long time at an inexpensive price.  Goes on smoothly and easily.  The brush in the pic does not come with it - or at least I didn&#x27;t get one, but was not really an issue for me.  The product is great.</li>
            <li> same thing if u put too much u still can&#x27;t see it its like u not putting anything u should be able to see at least something</li>
            <li> I am always skeptical about buying an item over the internet i know knothing about,but this product is worth it. I have dark circles under my eyes and when i use this product it looks like my face is flawless. It is worth buying and i will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> eh!!  I&#x27;m not impressed at all, I have lighter skin and this was like adding nothing.  I wanted the inner corners of my eyes and under my eyes to pop and this just seems to cake up.  It was an add on item so I thought I would give it a try.... No Bueno!!!&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again!!</li>
            <li> It does what it says. I bought it for my wife and she is really satisfied with it</li>
            <li> As an esthetician I have tried various  make up. What I like about e.l.f is there affordability. ThE quality  of there cosmetics are so impressive. I use e.l.f everyday and will continue to do so. If you try e.l.f you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love this setting powder, the only thing preventing me from giving it 5 stars is that there&#x27;s so much glitter in the powder that it&#x27;s a bit distracting under my eyes. Love that it keeps my under eye concealer set in place throughout the day but could really do without the glittery effect it gives.</li>
            <li> This helps my eye liner and shadow that is applied below my lid to stay on all day without smearing. At first I thought this product was really pointless and without use (waste of money) but then I started noticing my make up staying in tact much longer and looking perfect from morning to night. I DO recommend this product to anyone and everyone. It came quickly and packaged without any damages.</li>
            <li> Ok, So I knew this was a setting powder, but I did not expect the shimmer. Maybe on lighter skin tones (I&#x27;m an NC50 for those familiar with MAC...or dark skinned for those who aren&#x27;t) this would be complementary, but it just looks odd on me. I think I was expecting something more along the lines of the Ben Nye Luxury Powder... I would not recommend this to my dark skin sistas, but at this price if you are lighter complexioned, I&#x27;d give it a shot.</li>
            <li> has possible uses but not for what they say! I found it far far too sparkly with actual larger pieces of ?glitter that I was trying to pick off and ended up looking so bad, I had to wash my face, re-moisturize, rest my skin which got irritated and start over! I also prefer a creamy highlighter that you blend in like from Body Shop- I do like some ELF products, and tried this several ways as suggested on box- mixed in with cream as highlighter, and then tried to salvage as just light colored eye shadow/highlighter but those darn sparkly flecks would still end up under my eyes and on my cheeks... if you like sparkle and are much younger (I&#x27;m 42) then might be great for you! ;-)</li>
            <li> Like this product helps with my concealer jst to small next time need to buy two or see tgey sell bigger bottle</li>
            <li> Wow, this is fantastic. gives me a glow in addition to being a great setting powder for my concealer. Love it!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;After you&#x27;ve finished your makeup, go back under your eyes with the powder. Gives you an amazing shimmer and glow.</li>
            <li> Not really that good. Waste of money. After about 2 hours you couldn&#x27;t even notice it on. When i first put on it was shimmery under my eyes</li>
            <li> This powder sets my undereye concealer and does not accent fine lines or wrinkles.  It does have a glittery look to it when initially applied, but the glittery look disappears quickly after application.  I love this powder!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t cover at all...but for $3 worth the try...other elf products like their blush and eye shadows are good so I thought I would give it a try...horrible..no coverage at all just use my concelar</li>
            <li> It is ok but needs to be reapplied</li>
            <li> You can use this stuff with or without makeup underneath and it looks great. If you use with concealer it works fantastic to keep it looking fresh all day without getting creases or eyeliner smearing down under your eyes. I use it on my lids to to set them and control the same thing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good I&#x27;m still trying it out.</li>
            <li> This product does seem to help with under eye darkness.  I don&#x27;t mind the little shine but for some it might be a problem.  Would recommend to others. I would buy this again because the price was good.</li>
            <li> Came quick just like promised ....the product even though small is very generous theres alot packed in there and when applied it looks kinda white but when your photographed it looks amazing ... a little goes a long way with this powder</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It has a tiny bit of sparkle to it, so I use it over the light portion of my eye shadow. It really brightens the eye.</li>
            <li> I havent contacted the seller because I purchased it a while ago but I only used it twice and don&#x27;t like it at all.  It doesn&#x27;t conceal any dark circles under the eyes...</li>
            <li> DRIES OUT AND GETS HARD WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO APPLY,</li>
            <li> I like the powder but difficult to get out of sifter, needs a better brush.</li>
            <li> I love this under eye setting powder!! I apply this after putting on my concealer and it sets it really well. It doesn&#x27;t make my concealer crease and brightens up my under eye area. I think I can also use this alone for the days that I don&#x27;t have concealer on just to brighten up my under eye area a little bit. It looks shimmery on the container, but it doesn&#x27;t look like that when you apply it on your face. It&#x27;s affordable and I recommend this! Will definitely be repurchasing once I&#x27;m out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very impressed with how this brightens my undereyes, taking years off eyes. I&#x27;m 38 years old and I&#x27;ve been confused for my 21 year old co-worker.</li>
            <li> After reading some other reviews I think it&#x27;s important to note this product is NOT a concealer, it SETS your concealer. There is a very minimal shimmer to this that serves as a high lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is the brush that comes with it, I just use my ring finger to pat the product on and it works great!</li>
            <li> Powder is not dense enough to suit me.  I just noticed they use the word &amp;#34;sheer&amp;#34; to describe the product.  My bad.  It is very &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34; and spreads beautifully.  Their brush doesn&#x27;t work for me and I&#x27;m using my own.</li>
            <li> Love it! Works better applied before concealer</li>
            <li> I watch lots of makeup tips on YouTube. I just switched to mac prolong wear concealer but needed a nice setting powder to sit on top so makeup won&#x27;t sink in fine lines and smudge, etc. This is perfect just for that. It&#x27;s shear and sets concealer while brightening up under eye area. Was recommended specifically by shaaanxo on YouTube and works flawlessly. Definitely recommend. Oh, and the price for this stuff is an added bonus</li>
            <li> Love this for setting under the eyes, works really well.</li>
            <li> Great product, it does exactly what it said it does, which is to conceal under eye bags.</li>
            <li> Love this concealer, it never cakes ..very smooth look...a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love elf brushes but, this particular product did not deliver what I was expecting. It shines!&lt;br /&gt;Shiny concelar?????</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the container is so small do product doesn&#x27;t last. It adds a radiance to wherever you apply it. Looks nice, subtle, and is a nice final touch.</li>
            <li> This is WONDERFUL! I&#x27;ve tried soooo many concealer setting powders from high end to drugstore,&lt;br /&gt;and this is definitely #1 for me.&lt;br /&gt;It sets the concealer perfectly, I did NOT experience any creasing. This just holds up very nicely &amp; I&#x27;m so pleased&lt;br /&gt;to have found such an inexpensive product to work so well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a GREAT buy, Recommend this product for sure!!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it. And it&#x27;s very small like sample size. I will see how Good the produce is tommorow.</li>
            <li> Sets undereye area very well, but there will most definitely be flashback in photos.</li>
            <li> ELF products are fabulous!</li>
            <li> I am a fan of some of the Elf brand products, and had read promising reviews (on Amazon) about this product, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I was very disappointed! :-(  This is supposed to be an undereye setting powder for concealer, but this is just waaay too glittery! Think disco ball glittery!  When worn under the eye, it looks like glittery eyeshadow fall out. So, unless you&#x27;re looking for a loose powder eye shadow with white sparkle, (this would definitely work for that use), I&#x27;d say pass this one up!</li>
            <li> The picture shows a translucent powder, which it is not, the powder to me looks like a peachy/pink. In other reviews people had mentioned there was shimmer, it is not shimmer, there are actual RAINBOW sparkles. Which I didn&#x27;t particularly like. The powder was in the original package, however, the package was not taped or sealed closed in any way, which is fine, aside from the fact it seems tampered with. The top of the box was dented and popped open which I assumed was from all the shipping, but when I opened it my brush was inside, and there is a slot on the outside of the box where it is intended to be. The brush also had hard white things (?) in the bristles, which I just washed off. As for how well the powder actually works, my gel eyeliner has already within an hour started to transfer. But - you get what you pay for, and this is only a drug store product.</li>
            <li> Rip off two dollars at your local drug store! I have it and it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> A little shimmery, but I do like this product.</li>
            <li> Great setting powder!!  I would buy it again!!!</li>
            <li> For me this product isn&#x27;t the best as I tend to have super dark bags under my eyes while it does liken them it doesn&#x27;t completely cover the bags. My friend tried it and it worked great for her but she also has lighter bags then I do. The product goes on easy and blends in well takes so getting to used to on how to apply it properly. Great product for people wit h light bags under the eyes but if you have dark ones go for a cream or liquid product.</li>
            <li> I added this to my cart to qualify for free shipping ($3 Add-on item). That being said I&#x27;m glad I did because actually like this product.  After opening it the lid looked a little shimmery (see pic) - I hesitate to use the word glittery because I feel like that&#x27;s not how you would want to describe an under eye setting powder... But I was worried that it would look shimmery under my eye but it did not at all.  Although I like this product, I&#x27;m not sure it does much of a difference compared to my face HD translucent powder or the yellow translucent powder.  The brush is pretty useless, it&#x27;s a little too small for good, even, quick application of under eye powder - it would work well for foundation on a Barbie.  I&#x27;m not sure if this would be good for &amp;#34;baking&amp;#34;, but I&#x27;ve yet to try to that with it. (Baking is a technique for setting concealer/highlighting etc. - see youtube) I probably won&#x27;t purchase this again because although it is only $3, it is so small and I feel like there are better under eye powders that are concealers in it of themselves, and better under eye concealers that don&#x27;t require a specific setting powder, but rather set well with regular HD face powders.  __________________ Sold by: Amazon LLC Shipped by: Amazon LLC Delivered: 5 days after order date</li>
            <li> application was smooth, i could notice it did have decent coverage</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and was packaged well. I am really falling for E.L.F products. This is the first time I&#x27;ve used an under eye concealing setting powder. I used it on a client for Photoshoot and we both really loved the outcome as did the camera!! Will order again!!</li>
            <li> Got this 6 days before the expected date. Love the product, Its a little smaller than I thought it would be but I love the product regardless!</li>
            <li> Great product I will recommend it</li>
            <li> WARNING - Sparkles.  I don&#x27;t like the shimmery effect at all.  Had I read all the reviews and known it was not sheer, I would have skipped this one.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but felt like it was worth a try since it&#x27;s so inexpensive. I love it! It definitely helps my concealer stay on longer. And I do think it makes the area a little bit later because of the summer which looks very nice.</li>
            <li> its a good product but for certain skin types</li>
            <li> works great love it will buy again</li>
            <li> This powder surprised me.  I was expecting it to sit in the creases under my eyes and instead it did what it was supposed to which is set the under eye concealer.</li>
            <li> I swear by this stuff. You can use it with no concealer but it also is a great setting powder</li>
            <li> Product is great.  However the brush is extremely small.  They could have sent a larger brush.  Product is really great.</li>
            <li> Its a good setting powder, but it just has to much sparkle to be useful for an everyday look.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this because when you look at it closely you&#x27;ll see that it has a shimmer and that it&#x27;s actually a little bit rosy in color. I was expecting it to be a disaster, but, somehow, when I apply this with a fluffy concealer brush (I use the new Flawless Concealer Brush from ELF) the undereye area looks great! Any kind of fine line instantly disappears! It simply makes everything look natural, but flawless. I also use the smallest amount. I love this stuff! It does not cake up on me and I find that it works better for setting the undereye area than either the translucent or corrective yellow HD powders from ELF. I&#x27;ll repurchase this if I ever run out.</li>
            <li> Satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do much. Just looks like white eyeshadow</li>
            <li> Great product. It keeps the concealer under my eyes from wrinkling and creasing. Great buy. It&#x27;s not shimmery it&#x27;s translucent and wonderful</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t conceal anything and actually drew more attention to the fine lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really notice a difference with this</li>
            <li> Smaller the what I expected</li>
            <li> I never use it. It&#x27;s one of those, &amp;#34;tried it once and threw it in a drawer&amp;#34; kinda things. The brush that comes with it is horrid. You may as well not even try to use that thing. It&#x27;s rock hard and doesn&#x27;t blend anything. It&#x27;s very shimmery. It&#x27;s just.. Meh. It&#x27;s not great, could be worse.. Meh.</li>
            <li> light and airy... nice!</li>
            <li> I love this powder.  I am very fair, and the powder is WHITE so it looks great under my eyes. I just tap it on with my fingers, and it helps to set my concealer and also add some brightness to my circles.  A little goes a long way! I do not know how thi looks on darker skin tones, but I would assume you would get more of a Jennifer Lopez look under your eyes.</li>
            <li> It takes forever to get the powder out! Not a fan of this product at all!</li>
            <li> This is a great product a must have if your atemping to brighten up your eyes.</li>
            <li> too glittery, visible glitter particles</li>
            <li> Completely useless. Does not conceal anything, just makes it look shiny and very pale.</li>
            <li> I used it. I can&#x27;t tell I used it. No one else can tell I have it on. I am not sure it did anything it claims to do. Why bother?</li>
            <li> I saw some reviews that said the shimmer was bad, but its not I couldn&#x27;t tell it had shimmer when I put it under my eyes. It does work on brightening under the eyes would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I can notice a difference when using this either for setting for for HD highlighting.  I use a big fluffy brush to apply a thin layer under my eyes.  I have not used anything like this before, so I have no comparison.</li>
            <li> This item didn&#x27;t come with the brush.</li>
            <li> Keeps your concealer on with out looking white or powdery.  It looks white but is transparent</li>
            <li> Extremely small, and no brush came with my product.</li>
            <li> Mine came with the brush shown put it was on the outside of the packaging and pretty easy to miss.  I am not sure if this has worked any wonders for my dark circles but it certainly hasn&#x27;t made them look worse and now that summer is here and I have more issues with wandering/melting mascara I need a powder around my eyes, so as long as it doesn&#x27;t make my wrinkles look worse as so many do, I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a setting powder for under eye concealer. Didn&#x27;t see any magical brightening properties.</li>
            <li> this is by far the most useless make up I own and I own a lot of it! I am just being honest and this is my opinion on this particular product. Don&#x27;t buy it! There are a lot better brands out there - a bit more $, but in the end you do get what you pay for! This one I could have spent the cash a lot smarter!</li>
            <li> Very smooth application.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I like elf brand but this basically has zero pigment. You have to use A LOT to get some highlight on there</li>
            <li> I was not expecting the shimmers to be as noticable.  I like the feel of the powder very much, but could do without the sparkle.</li>
            <li> Works great, I just wish it didn&#x27;t have the sparkles in it so I could wear it for everyday</li>
            <li> Very good setting powder but comes in a small bottle</li>
            <li> I love ELF products this is a great buy and the price is wonderful. I do not use it everyday but, when I do I really notice the difference. I would recommend this for anyone who has dark circles under the eyes. I only have to apply this in the morning and still looks great at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> No brush came with this product</li>
            <li> Works great as a setting powder over under eye concealer! Love it! Lasts forever as well</li>
            <li> Nothing to really rave about here. It literally is just a transparent loose setting powder. Just so people know that literally is all that it is. It will not make your under eye circles look better. I probably won&#x27;t purchase it again. I will just go back to setting my concealer with my all over face powder which seems to work just as well and will save me money, time and less layers on my face.</li>
            <li> The lid doesn&#x27;t screw on well. It is very little product, I think you get the same results using the elf face primer.</li>
            <li> UNDER EYES IT DOSE HELP MINIMIZE ANYTHING YOU CANT EVEN SEE IT WHEN YOU PUT IT ON. DONT RECOMMEND TO BUY.</li>
            <li> It is a great product. It works pretty well udner your eyes. The effect is amazing, i did not not expect it considering the price of the product. i will certainly buy it again. I see only a small disadvantage - the package is too small.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing under eye setting powder I&#x27;ve ever used. It is finely milled and very silky feeling.  There is blue shimmer in the product, but it does not show on the skin.</li>
            <li> Jury still out on this product.</li>
            <li> Clumps into the lines so idk if I am using it wrong or what, but I don&#x27;t really like it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sparkly and I HATE glitter, but it works so well I don&#x27;t even care anymore.</li>
            <li> i think the powder is effective and blends well.&lt;br /&gt;It sets well on skin with no irritation for me.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it is elf size.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be going fast.&lt;br /&gt;  Omana</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase of this product.  I am very pleased with the discreet and effective concealing effect under the eyes</li>
            <li> After applying foundation, use concealer on dark circles under eyes then place setting powder in a V-shape. This will brighten area under eyes and around upper cheeks.</li>
            <li> This setting powder works amazingly. I feel that because it&#x27;s such a lightweight and translucent type of powder, it helps to keep my undereye area looking fresh and not cakey. It does have some sparkly sheen going on, but if you&#x27;re subtle with how much powder you apply and don&#x27;t go heavy handed, then it shouldn&#x27;t be an issue. My only complaint would be that I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of loose powders because they get messy, but whatever, it works great anyway!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: The brush it comes with is absolutely useless; it&#x27;s more like a flat detailed liner/smudger brush. I just tossed it and I use a fluffy mini kabuki brush with this powder.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a bigger container and more in quantity. I must not have paid attention to the weight or volume! I like the product but I don&#x27;t really see a difference. I do have dark circles under my eyes though. I&#x27;m still getting used to the product so hopefully I&#x27;ll grow fonder. Shipping and delivery was fast and efficient. No complaints about the seller!</li>
            <li> It has glitter in it and I&#x27;m not really interested in making my bags and dark circles shine. All in all it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Great item to hide those dark circles!</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT TO BRIGHEN UNDER EYE AND HELPS DEFLECT HOLLOWNESS</li>
            <li> This powder seems to showcase fine lines.  I didn&#x27;t know I had so many till using this powder.  I switched to the finishing powder by MAC. I look normal again.</li>
            <li> Although I am a certified &amp;#34;Amazon Addict&amp;#34;, I did not buy this product from them. Yet, I wanted to put in my two cents because I have read the reviews, and it seems people either love it or hate it! I was lucky enough to score this little gem packaged with a tube of the ELF Tone Correcting Concealer for $2.99 at my local TJ Maxx. Since it was so cheap, I grabbed up the three that they had, and am soooooo glad I did! It works beautifully! The product I purchased just has the slightest bit of shimmer, glides on like silk, and makes my under-eye area look amazing! Keeps concealer and eyeliner in check. And looks amazing in photos! Definitely will buy again, and definitely reccomend!</li>
            <li> Great product! Really helps in setting under eye concealer and foundation!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give them a 3, I haven&#x27;t used it much so I can&#x27;t give a review in terms of the product.  All I can say is that its really really small and the brush super small and hard. I threw it away immediately.</li>
            <li> After applying foundation, use concealer on dark circles under eyes then place setting powder in a V-shape. This will brighten area under eyes and around upper cheeks.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and does what it&#x27;s suppose to do in terms of dark eye coverage.</li>
            <li> Terrible! It&#x27;s small and never came with the brush! It was packaged like it has already been used</li>
            <li> love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
            <li> Wish this product came in a larger size. I have yet to try this product. Fast shipping, reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Really helps to brighten up my eyes and works very well to conceal dark circles. Easy to apply, too.</li>
            <li> my first and last setting powder. love it!</li>
            <li> Item was a lot smaller that i anticipated yet the product itself made up for that with its wonderful application and coverage over my liquid highlighing concealers. I dont know what i would do with out it.</li>
            <li> Extremely sparkly do not recommend putting on unless makeup goes over the top</li>
            <li> Works great, sets concealer and prevents under eye mascara smudges</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the eyes.  I use it as an eyeliner setting powder as well &amp; do not have any smudges anymore.</li>
            <li> Works well for the eyeliner. It makes it last longer without smearing.</li>
            <li> Great product, I love it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really great - don&#x27;t be afraid of the tiny bit of sparkle, it doesn&#x27;t actually look sparkly, but the light reflecting quality helps with under eye circles. It works as well as the $25 stuff I was using, but doesn&#x27;t have any parabens and isn&#x27;t animal tested, so yay.</li>
            <li> I needed a product to help cover my dark circles under my eyes, ever since I had my little one my circles turned fairly darker. This one helps a bit, but doesn&#x27;t cover much on me I think it&#x27;s just because my under eyes circles are very dark. This product is good for people who don&#x27;t have them to dark, but overall it helps me a bit so it&#x27;s okay.</li>
