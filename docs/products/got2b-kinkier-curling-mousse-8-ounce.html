            <li>AWESOME!!!</li>
            <li>Best mousse I&#x27;ve found for my curly hair!</li>
            <li>SO BUY IT TODAY AND SEE THE GREAT RESULTS!!</li>
            <li>/&gt; This curling mousse leaves my curls looking beautiful!</li>
            <li>With this product, my hair comes out perfect every day.  </li>
            <li>very good</li>
            <li>it took every beautiful thing my hair had...</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m happy with.</li>
            <li>Get so many people complimenting me and asking what I use in my hair!</li>
            <li>The Freeze hairspray is also good as an affordable alternative to CHI Helmet Head (which is my favorite).  </li>
            <li>I bought the product for delivery in Brazil through mailbox ( suite ) in USA (via skybox site ) and was reported by the intermediary company that it is hazardous material which requires special freight with an estimated cost of U.S. $ 900.00 (yes , nine hundred dollars!)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very bizarre.</li>
            <li>a deal I won&#x27;t be able to find</li>
            <li>I HAVE USE THIS PRODUCT BEFORE, I REALLY LOVE HOW THIS GOT2B KINKIER CURLING DOES TO YOUR HAIR.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light and airy product that foams nicely from the dispenser and stays foamy until dispersed in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Item ( s ) Subtotal : $ 12.60 + Shipping &amp; Handling : $ 69.86 , and can not receive them nor return to the seller the most requested items .</li>
            <li>My favorite mousse is TIGI Catwalk Strong Mousse.  </li>
            <li>Important to say that my billing address was Brazil, which requires greater attention from Amazon about issues of this nature .</li>
            <li>YOUR PRICES ARE JUST RIGHT FOR MY BUDGET!!</li>
            <li>It has an easy smell to get used to.</li>
            <li>It is very light weight, and makes my hair super curly.</li>
            <li>it curled up just fine.  </li>
            <li>I hope they don&#x27;t completely discontinue the original kind!  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this product.</li>
            <li>Kinkier is fabulous for the price.  </li>
            <li>I also love the fresh, almost &amp;#34;seaside&amp;#34; smell it has.</li>
            <li>Great curls that last all day.  </li>
            <li>I bought this stuff in hopes that it would give me great curls that would last throughout the day..</li>
            <li>I loved the old Kinky mousse</li>
            <li>At first my curls looked good when I first applied, but after 15 to 20 min</li>
            <li>I LOVED the old &#x27;kinky&#x27; mousse...</li>
            <li>After trying many products this is the first that when I scrunch damp hair it holds</li>
            <li>so I was excited when I saw they had a newer one.</li>
            <li>* Wish I got to try the original version</li>
            <li>Now I have to go search for the original...</li>
            <li>I never used the original version, so I can&#x27;t compare the two.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use several Got2be products with good results.  </li>
            <li>It smells good and is very light and fluffy, with no gloppy build-up.</li>
            <li>I have fine, somewhat thin hair, and have been very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read other reviews that say this liquifies right after dispensing, but I haven&#x27;t noticed or experienced that at all.</li>
            <li>The curls lasted all day (with the addition of good hairspray) and even through the second day when I again used the hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>I rolled my hair in hot rollers like I always do and VIOLA!  </li>
            <li>and she was right on.  </li>
            <li>Will b buying more on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>none of them were consistent.  </li>
            <li>Got at Walmart cause my regular curling moose wasn&#x27;t available.</li>
            <li>It really does hold the curl/wave.</li>
            <li>I really like this mousse and will use it when I can&#x27;t find the TIGI.  </li>
            <li>But I get and keep more curls just from scrunching it while it&#x27;s wet (with no product) than I do when I use this stuff.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>IT IS LIGHT AND KEEPS IT SHINNING AND STYLE ALL DAY LONG.</li>
            <li>Now, if I can&#x27;t find the TIGI at a decent price, I have something I can substitute.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Wow it really works and is not hard and gooey at all.</li>
            <li>Just soft and shiny hair!  </li>
            <li>My hair is never stiff or \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; anymore.  </li>
            <li>I moved to Las Vegas and my curly hair went straight to total frizz.  </li>
            <li>It always feels soft.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it smell but it makes my hair looks like a rats nest,just full of tangles and loose strains flying every which way.</li>
            <li>I just bought TWO bottles of the new \\&quot;kinkier\\&quot; mousse and the exact same thing happened with BOTH bottles as with the other reviews - the mousse comes out, poofs up, then completely fizzes down to a bubbly liquid!</li>
            <li>I have thick, naturally curly hair so usually any basic curling product or even just plain gel works great to keep my curls from frizzing</li>
            <li>It also leaves my hair stiff and wet looking, unlike the original version of this product.</li>
            <li>It would turn extremely liquid-y straight out of the bottle and basically disintegrate in my hair, leaving gross white flakes on my scalp making it look as though I have dandruff.</li>
            <li>This mousse smooths my hair, gives it a little body and any style I shape it in holds very well.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> My hair is super thick, long and coarse in texture.</li>
            <li> it dry out so bad that it look like Monkey dry hair I had to cut 3 inches of my beautiful long hair</li>
            <li> I keep trying other kinds (just because got2b is more expensive), but I keep going back to got2b.  </li>
            <li> My hair is curly but very fine, and in cold dry weather tends to just sort of hang there.  </li>
            <li> But as long as I have the scrunches I will take the crunchy hair.  </li>
            <li> As long as they continue to make this product, I will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair unmanageable and dry.  </li>
            <li> No \\&quot;wet\\&quot; look or crunchy feel once my curls dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is very hard to curl and the TIGI works really well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pure silicone, just like more expensive serums (Paul Mitchell and Biosilk come to mind), and with the humidity in Florida I need it desperately since frizz is a never ending battle.  </li>
            <li> Got2b curling mouse did not really help my curls</li>
            <li> I use the Got2be Shine Serum on wet hair to seal out the frizzies.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have very long thick hair all the way to the bottom of my back n one bottle</li>
            <li> I purchased some and saved my receipt in case it proved to be like all the other mousses and gels I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> The other Got2be hairsprays all have water as an ingredient (which makes no sense to me).  </li>
            <li> Half of my hair looked moose and the other half would just poof</li>
            <li> It just weighs my hair down and gives it a greasy look.</li>
            <li> this product mess up my hair ...</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair that really isn&#x27;t that difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> its stiff n crunchy.</li>
            <li> I was not pleased with the mousse at all.  </li>
            <li> However , to my surprise , the product is not likely to return , because it is a product considered dangerous .</li>
            <li> and I think that helps keep my thick, type 3b/c curls defined but not crunchy.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed, did not get this product, got another, its not bad, but it is not what I ordered</li>
            <li> This is not fair to the consumer .</li>
            <li> Definitely disappointed as this is not cheap.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the other reviewers had a bad batch of bottles, but Kinkier is my lifesaver of curls and waves!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but it works.  </li>
            <li> By purchasing the product, there is no information on the Amazon site that this is a dangerous product .</li>
            <li> Completely useless!</li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>
            <li> Awful awful awful</li>

            <li> After trying many products this is the first that when I scrunch damp hair it holds the scruches n creates curls n holds it all day. The only draw back is that its stiff n crunchy. But as long as I have the scrunches I will take the crunchy hair.  Lasts all day too.  I have very long thick hair all the way to the bottom of my back n one bottle lasts me about 10  days to 14 days. Will b buying more on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> AWESOME!!! Get so many people complimenting me and asking what I use in my hair!</li>
            <li> I just bought this product at the store yesterday. I loved the old Kinky mousse so I was excited when I saw they had a newer one. I tried 4 different squirts and no matter what I did, it comes out liquid-y, starts to stiffen up, but then it fizzles and bubbles and returns to a liquid state. It&#x27;s very bizarre. It also leaves my hair stiff and wet looking, unlike the original version of this product. I hate it.</li>
            <li> * Got2b curling mouse did not really help my curls&lt;br /&gt;* At first my curls looked good when I first applied, but after 15 to 20 min my curls were gone&lt;br /&gt;* Wish I got to try the original version</li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally curly hair so usually any basic curling product or even just plain gel works great to keep my curls from frizzing but this did not work at all. It would turn extremely liquid-y straight out of the bottle and basically disintegrate in my hair, leaving gross white flakes on my scalp making it look as though I have dandruff. (which I don&#x27;t) I thought maybe it was just a fluke, but I have received 2 of these products from this seller and the results remain the same. Definitely disappointed as this is not cheap.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this product. It is very light weight, and makes my hair super curly. It has an easy smell to get used to. A little bit goes a long way. I would totally recommend this product</li>
            <li> Got at Walmart cause my regular curling moose wasn&#x27;t available. Not only does it smell but it makes my hair looks like a rats nest,just full of tangles and loose strains flying every which way. Half of my hair looked moose and the other half would just poof out.also makes my head itchy. Awful awful awful</li>
            <li> My hair is curly but very fine, and in cold dry weather tends to just sort of hang there.  This mousse does add body and curl and brings my hair back to life.  It smells good and is very light and fluffy, with no gloppy build-up.</li>
            <li> I moved to Las Vegas and my curly hair went straight to total frizz.  I got this product as a friend endorsed it.  Wow it really works and is not hard and gooey at all.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair unmanageable and dry.  I was not pleased with the mousse at all.  But I paid for the item.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed, did not get this product, got another, its not bad, but it is not what I ordered</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mousse for years! I like that the mousse is thicker than others and I think that helps keep my thick, type 3b/c curls defined but not crunchy.  It also doesn&#x27;t flake</li>
            <li> a deal I won&#x27;t be able to find so I won&#x27;t be buying that again I was looking for something on your subscription list and found this instead</li>
            <li> My Hair Stylist told me to buy this brand and she was right on.  It really does hold the curl/wave.</li>
            <li> I just bought TWO bottles of the new \\&quot;kinkier\\&quot; mousse and the exact same thing happened with BOTH bottles as with the other reviews - the mousse comes out, poofs up, then completely fizzes down to a bubbly liquid! Completely useless! I LOVED the old &#x27;kinky&#x27; mousse...I keep trying other kinds (just because got2b is more expensive), but I keep going back to got2b.  I hope they don&#x27;t completely discontinue the original kind!  Now I have to go search for the original...</li>
            <li> Best mousse I&#x27;ve found for my curly hair!</li>
            <li> If I can give this product 0 start I would... this product mess up my hair ... it took every beautiful thing my hair had... it dry out so bad that it look like Monkey dry hair I had to cut 3 inches of my beautiful long hair and I didnt even finish one bottle... Do no buy!!!!!!!!!!!!! Im warning you!</li>
            <li> I HAVE USE THIS PRODUCT BEFORE, I REALLY LOVE HOW THIS GOT2B KINKIER CURLING DOES TO YOUR HAIR. IT GROWS YOUR HAIR AS WELL. IT IS LIGHT AND KEEPS IT SHINNING AND STYLE ALL DAY LONG. SO BUY IT TODAY AND SEE THE GREAT RESULTS!! THANK YOU AMAMZOM YOUR PRICES ARE JUST RIGHT FOR MY BUDGET!!</li>
            <li> My favorite mousse is TIGI Catwalk Strong Mousse.  It&#x27;s expensive, but it works.  My hair is very hard to curl and the TIGI works really well.  In fact, it&#x27;s the only product that&#x27;s ever worked.  The trouble is it&#x27;s really pricey and sometimes I can&#x27;t find it at TJ Maxx at a deep discount.  I refuse to pay the retail price.  Enter the Got2be Curling Mousse.  I purchased some and saved my receipt in case it proved to be like all the other mousses and gels I&#x27;ve tried.  Well, it worked!  I rolled my hair in hot rollers like I always do and VIOLA!  it curled up just fine.  Just like the TIGI!  The curls lasted all day (with the addition of good hairspray) and even through the second day when I again used the hot rollers.  This is an inexpensive alternative to the TIGI mousse.  Now, if I can&#x27;t find the TIGI at a decent price, I have something I can substitute.  I use several Got2be products with good results.  I use the Got2be Shine Serum on wet hair to seal out the frizzies.  It works like a charm.  It&#x27;s pure silicone, just like more expensive serums (Paul Mitchell and Biosilk come to mind), and with the humidity in Florida I need it desperately since frizz is a never ending battle.  The Freeze hairspray is also good as an affordable alternative to CHI Helmet Head (which is my favorite).  It contains no water (why would you want a hairspray that contains water, huh?) and holds any style in place all day.  The other Got2be hairsprays all have water as an ingredient (which makes no sense to me).  I really like this mousse and will use it when I can&#x27;t find the TIGI.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the other reviewers had a bad batch of bottles, but Kinkier is my lifesaver of curls and waves!  My hair is super thick, long and coarse in texture. My curls are considered a 2b, spiral curl &amp; wave.  I never used the original version, so I can&#x27;t compare the two.&lt;br /&gt; This curling mousse leaves my curls looking beautiful! It&#x27;s a light and airy product that foams nicely from the dispenser and stays foamy until dispersed in my hair.  No \\&quot;wet\\&quot; look or crunchy feel once my curls dry. Just soft and shiny hair!  I&#x27;ve been using Ouidad for my hair care, but I have to say that this Schawzkopf  Kinkier is fabulous for the price.  I hope they never stop making this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews that say this liquifies right after dispensing, but I haven&#x27;t noticed or experienced that at all. This mousse smooths my hair, gives it a little body and any style I shape it in holds very well. I have fine, somewhat thin hair, and have been very happy with it.  I also love the fresh, almost &amp;#34;seaside&amp;#34; smell it has.</li>
            <li> I bought the product for delivery in Brazil through mailbox ( suite ) in USA (via skybox site ) and was reported by the intermediary company that it is hazardous material which requires special freight with an estimated cost of U.S. $ 900.00 (yes , nine hundred dollars!) for delivery in Brazil . The Skybox advised me to solicit the return to the seller . However , to my surprise , the product is not likely to return , because it is a product considered dangerous . By purchasing the product, there is no information on the Amazon site that this is a dangerous product . I paid for my order Item ( s ) Subtotal : $ 12.60 + Shipping &amp; Handling : $ 69.86 , and can not receive them nor return to the seller the most requested items . Although return the products could return, I will have to bear the onus of freight already paid . This is not fair to the consumer . Important to say that my billing address was Brazil, which requires greater attention from Amazon about issues of this nature . Urgent need for a solution to this problem.</li>
            <li> I have used this scrunching mousse for 3 weeks now.  I have tried several others, with varied results...none of them were consistent.  With this product, my hair comes out perfect every day.  Great curls that last all day.  My hair is never stiff or \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; anymore.  It always feels soft.  As long as they continue to make this product, I will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff in hopes that it would give me great curls that would last throughout the day..it doesn&#x27;t last 2 hours. I have thick wavy hair that really isn&#x27;t that difficult to work with. But I get and keep more curls just from scrunching it while it&#x27;s wet (with no product) than I do when I use this stuff. It just weighs my hair down and gives it a greasy look. It just turns into a watery oil type substance in your hand too. I would definitely not recommend this product for anyone, regardless of your hair type.</li>
            <li> very good and i&#x27;m happy with. thanks</li>
