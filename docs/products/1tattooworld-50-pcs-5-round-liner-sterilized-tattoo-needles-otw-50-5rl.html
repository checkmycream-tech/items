            <li> Cheap price, but very decent quality needles.  I use them a lot, and haven&#x27;t had any issues with them.  They have held up pretty well in all the tattoos i&#x27;ve used them on.</li>
            <li> The needles came in, in a few days, packaging was good, the needles worked fine. This company has gained my trust and I will be purchasing more from them. :) This has the same review as the 3 Round Liner needles because they came in the same box :P</li>
            <li> GREAT Price! These are the same needles a local retailer was offering for considerably more money. The needle perform great and I believe I have found a new supplier for my tattoo needle needs.</li>
            <li> good quality needles for a lot less then i pat for the same items from my regular supplier.would highly recomend.fast shipping</li>
            <li> These needles are amazing! They work great! They don&#x27;t hurt as bad as most needles and the ink sticks great with them!</li>
            <li> Recieved needles overnight shipping, used them the day I got them on a small tattoo on myself. Fairly high quality. Nice price. No issues at all. Will probably buy from again.</li>
            <li> These needles are great. I don&#x27;t use any other. They are nice and sharp and stay sharp for a big outline. I use these needles for thin AND thick outlines.</li>
            <li> Instead of receiving a line needle that I use regularly, I received 3RS. Not even close to what I needed and not something I even use</li>
            <li> i thought thes neddles were coming from the co.needle supply like it shows in the picture,or needle boy,i got mislead, but i tried the 5 liners last night and they work fair,the only thing i don&#x27;nt like about these neddles is they don&#x27;nt have a test strip on them,which soon the health dept. is going to require it to pass inspection,but i don&#x27;nt have that problem,but why don&#x27;nt they all start coming with the test strip,so tattoo shops can pass inspection,don&#x27;nt make any sense to me. i know what the needle co&#x27;s, are up to, i already see it they are going to jack the prices just for that little blue dot testing strip,you see. monster point already do the blue strip thing.lol crazy rick</li>
