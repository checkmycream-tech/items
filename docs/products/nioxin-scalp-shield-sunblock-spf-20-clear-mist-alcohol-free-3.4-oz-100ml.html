            <li>They both have fair skin.</li>
            <li>We will replenish with this product when we need more!</li>
            <li>Never go,out again without protection on top of your head!  </li>
            <li>Never had a scalp burn using this product and I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li>Sun block on the dome is ok at the beach or on a boat, but</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and my scalp gets burnt easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried quite a few sun blocks for my scalp and although none are perfect, this is the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>This product works great for an adult scalp!  </li>
            <li>Being very fair and having blonde hair my scalp always burns.</li>
            <li>Must have to do with it being of light viscosity or</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>The price of this product was worth saving my scalp, and decreasing my risk of skin cancer on my head!</li>

            <li>It does a good job of preventing sunburn, without being obvious.</li>
            <li>Too many of the products out there have a fragrance, which is about that last thing I need to spray on the top of my head.</li>
            <li>It is unclear whether this product offers broad-spectrum protection, which is something that is very important (and will probably soon be requested to be included on every sunscreen label by the FDA).  </li>
            <li>For this one it is unclear, but considering that manufacturers just love to advertise if and when a product offers protection against UVA and UVB rays</li>

            <li>I am an older male, with a good case of baldness.</li>

            <li>Product is hard to find in beauty stores and am happy I can get it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I am hoping for a similar product at a better price.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to my bother-in&#x3D;law  telling him about it while on a trip.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>So much better than any other I have tried.</li>
            <li>I am usually a satisfied Amazon customer, but in this case I really feel let down by them and the seller I bought from, Can Buy Me Beauty.  </li>
            <li>Sending someone an expired product is completely unacceptable for any product but especially for a product that someone is using to prevent sunburns and later skin cancer.</li>

            <li> $12.00 plus shipping for 3.4 oz. is expensive or maybe I&#x27;m cheap?</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t any less gross than spraying actual sunscreen on your scalp.  </li>
            <li> I put this on then blow dry</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I ordered this spray to use on my blonde-haired, light-skinned daughter (and myself)  to protect her scalp from the sun.  I was very happy with this lightweight product that does not leave our hair looking shiny or greasy. I tried a similar product a couple of years ago and it made my hair heavy and it looked like I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair for a week!  This product was completely different! It has provided excellent coverage!  We will replenish with this product when we need more!</li>
            <li> Only had occasion to use once, but it worked.  Did not make hair greasy.</li>
            <li> A great product, include the sunblock with the hairspray. I don&#x27;t have to wear a hat all of the time.</li>
            <li> Scalp Shield is an awesome product. For a person loosing thier hair and discovering that somtimes the sun beats down a little to much burning the scalp, this product works. Leaves no oily residue, in fact you cant even see it on your skin. I also use it on my ears and you cant see it at all.</li>
            <li> It is unclear whether this product offers broad-spectrum protection, which is something that is very important (and will probably soon be requested to be included on every sunscreen label by the FDA).  For this one it is unclear, but considering that manufacturers just love to advertise if and when a product offers protection against UVA and UVB rays, I am assuming this one does not.</li>
            <li> l like this to protect my scalp from sunburn but it does make my hair look crunchy and feels chalky until I wash it out.</li>
            <li> I am usually a satisfied Amazon customer, but in this case I really feel let down by them and the seller I bought from, Can Buy Me Beauty.  I didn&#x27;t end up using it until after the 30 day A-to-Z guarantee.  Only then did I notice that the product had expired well before I even ordered it.  Sending someone an expired product is completely unacceptable for any product but especially for a product that someone is using to prevent sunburns and later skin cancer.</li>
            <li> For some reason this gave me a headache.  Must have to do with it being of light viscosity or whatever solvent effector it has in it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this scalp sunscreen for years. It really helps protect my scalp without a sticky or gunky build-up in my (very thin) hair.</li>
            <li> My husband uses it. Thanks to my bother-in&#x3D;law  telling him about it while on a trip. They both have fair skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to fing a sun block product for my scalp for years with no success&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is great and does not make my scalp dry and with dandruff</li>
            <li> Being very fair and having blonde hair my scalp always burns. This product saved me from another scalp burn! It feels a little like hairspray, but it clear and not sticky. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This product works great for an adult scalp!  You can use it without having that oily slick feeling in your hair. Never go,out again without protection on top of your head!  Wonderful product and will purchase more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few sun blocks for my scalp and although none are perfect, this is the best I&#x27;ve found so far. Someone mentioned it felt like hair spray. I&#x27;ve seen a little of this effect, but it doesn&#x27;t last. The Scalp Shield is not oily, and it doesn&#x27;t smell. Too many of the products out there have a fragrance, which is about that last thing I need to spray on the top of my head. It does a good job of preventing sunburn, without being obvious. I would reccomend this for all balding men.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this item but I have no idea if it works because it expired  a year ago.  I am very disappointed in Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am an older male, with a good case of baldness. The Nioxin Scalp Shield Sunblock is used to protect my head and face from precancerous skin spots. It seems to be reasonably effective if used properly. It does not make your skin and hair greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in Florida. Sun, sand, water. Sun block on the dome is ok at the beach or on a boat, but what about work?  I bought this after my dermatologist told me to start protecting my hairless head -- at all times. Even at work.  The review:  The good: it works for the average sun exposure on a work day and it does not smell. I still use regular block at the beach or on the water... and a hat.  The bad: In my opinion, it is pretty darn expensive. $12.00 plus shipping for 3.4 oz. is expensive or maybe I&#x27;m cheap? Where is the competition? At last look, this was IT in the marketplace. I&#x27;d like to see it at half the price, shipping included.  The rating: 4 stars for it works minus 1 star for it&#x27;s expensive. I am hoping for a similar product at a better price.  Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> This product works great for the scalp. I have very fine hair and my scalp gets burnt easily. I put this on then blow dry and it doesn&#x27;t get sticky.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic. spray it on my part and no more sunburn. Product is hard to find in beauty stores and am happy I can get it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The product protects against sunburn  but it isn&#x27;t any less gross than spraying actual sunscreen on your scalp.  I&#x27;d rather wear a hat than have this stuff in my hair.  I am a women with blond hair and very fair skin and my part always burns.  I gave it two stars because it doesn&#x27;t have alcohol in it so it&#x27;s not too bad for your hair, otherwise I&#x27;d have given it a 1.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen for hair. Never had a scalp burn using this product and I have very fine hair. When sprayed on, there is no residue, non-greasy. So much better than any other I have tried.</li>
            <li> I am a pale redhead with bangs, and every summer I burn my scalp where my hair parts. I bought this product before going on vacation in Panama. While I did get slightly burned on other areas of my body where I used regular sunscreen, my scalp did not burn at all. The price of this product was worth saving my scalp, and decreasing my risk of skin cancer on my head!</li>
