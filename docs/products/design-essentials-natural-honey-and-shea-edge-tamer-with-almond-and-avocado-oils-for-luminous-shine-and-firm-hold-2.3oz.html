            <li>I Love this shea Edge.</li>
            <li>Pleasant smell, not sticky , works very well</li>
            <li>Does a good job at taming edges just don&#x27;t use too much or it will cake up.</li>
            <li>Smells great, but does not tame or smooth my edges</li>
            <li>I spritz my edges lightly with water, apply a dap and brush.</li>
            <li>It holds great, but it turns white and visible</li>
            <li>This stuff gives my edges the sleek and shine of a fresh relaxer and it doesnt sweat or oil out!</li>
            <li>It does have a wonderful smell but served no purpose as it was too thick to spread and use on my hair.</li>
            <li>Super product - no film - no flakes.</li>
            <li>It is very sticky, but easy to wash off of your hands.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great for smoothing down the fly-aways when you put your hair up into a bun or ponytail!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used quite a few products to help with the little curly fly aways that I have, and this seems to be the best I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>Natural or not, this is a go :)</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you are trying to smooth out your edges.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is sticky, you will sweat it into a paste if it&#x27;s hot, it gets flaky, it doesnt hold your hair at all</li>
            <li>At first it may seem sticky, but once you put it in and start smoothing with your fingers, the stickiness is gone.</li>
            <li>Gave it 4 stars because the ingredient list didn&#x27;t match exactly what was described here and I&#x27;m allergic to castor oil, which it contains.</li>
            <li>Holds my edges down with no flakes, i love it!</li>
            <li>Works really well on natural hair smooth not flakey.</li>
            <li>My new fav, I&#x27;m going to start using there whole line.it leave my hair soft with a light sheen.</li>
            <li>Was really amazed at how well this slicked my edges.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t build up that much make it look like you got a perm</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not natural and it works just fine</li>
            <li>It does lay my hair down a lot better than Jam</li>
            <li>This product is good but not great.</li>
            <li>I live by this product..</li>
            <li>Definitely need to make sure to rub product in hand or if using a toothbrush for edges less is more or it will look hard and build up.</li>
            <li>but as far as lasting the whole day as an edge control.</li>
            <li>Keeps edge laid on natural hair</li>
            <li>I have natural hair.</li>
            <li>natural 4c hair type.</li>
            <li>It lays it right down.</li>
            <li>Mutiple applications on top of each other ruins its effectiveness and leaves a white residue that will show up.</li>
            <li>This edge controller really holds you down.</li>
            <li>Really holds my edges down!</li>

            <li> Really holds my edges down!</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing this year, it really last a long time, you only need a lil bit.  </li>
            <li> I just use my scarf for a while to lay it flat.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair, and it lays it down.  </li>
            <li> I was unable to smooth it onto my edges and make them lay flat.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now on my natural hair (4 a/b)</li>
            <li> I have not had an edge control that lasts for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> I used this on my natural hair and even as it came out the pack, it was stiff.  </li>
            <li> Later when I looked at my hair, everywhere I placed it was white, caked on, &amp; stiff like a type of pudding.  </li>
            <li> You only need a little bit to get the job done.</li>
            <li> If I have the time I will wear a scarf for a few minutes for extra hold.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t keep my edges down at all....</li>
            <li> Holds my edges for a little while throughout day.</li>
            <li> It is a stiff gel</li>
            <li> so I usually put a little in my palm and spread it around a lil before applying to my sides and that helps alleviate the stiffness of it.  </li>
            <li> I also mist my sides a little before applying this and then tie a scarf around for about 10 mins and my edges are laid for the rest of the day!  </li>
            <li> I usually wear a sew in</li>
            <li> It eventually gets overcome by excessive humidity or workout sweat, but I don&#x27;t expect any tamer to stand up to that.</li>
            <li> dries up after an hour or two and leaves my hair hard</li>
            <li> It feels like wax in my hair and is hard to wash out.</li>
            <li> However, it leaves my edges dry, dull and dirty looking.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Was not impressed.</li>
            <li> This is the worst thing I&#x27;ve ever put in my hair....</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now on my natural hair (4 a/b) and I love it.  This is my second time purchasing this year, it really last a long time, you only need a lil bit.  It is a stiff gel so I usually put a little in my palm and spread it around a lil before applying to my sides and that helps alleviate the stiffness of it.  I also mist my sides a little before applying this and then tie a scarf around for about 10 mins and my edges are laid for the rest of the day!  I&#x27;ve tried tons of edge gels and none of them have done the job I needed like this one so this tamer has earned its 5 stars all the way!</li>
            <li> Like this producted becuase its smells niice but as far as lasting the whole day as an edge control. IT SURE DOESNT... Make hair ever oily instead of layiing my edges..&lt;br /&gt;...</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell, not sticky , works very well</li>

            <li> So great stuff love it.</li>
            <li> Reorder.  Highly recommend if you are trying to smooth out your edges.</li>
            <li> Its White and makes my hair sticky all day..</li>
            <li> This is the worst thing I&#x27;ve ever put in my hair.... and I&#x27;ve bleached my hair before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is sticky, you will sweat it into a paste if it&#x27;s hot, it gets flaky, it doesnt hold your hair at all and it doesnt even smell that good. Seriously. Do not get this.</li>
            <li> I live by this product.. I will always be buying this edge control unless I find something better than Awesome!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It gives a nice hold and tames my baby hairs, whom have a mind of their own. I spritz my edges lightly with water, apply a dap and brush. If I have the time I will wear a scarf for a few minutes for extra hold. Natural or not, this is a go :)</li>
            <li> Keeps edge laid on natural hair</li>
            <li> It holds great, but it turns white and visible</li>
            <li> I have not had an edge control that lasts for a long period of time. I have had this for months and it is slaying for me. My edges are laid and looking like everything. I love this product.</li>
            <li> Hold is good, but could be a bit firmer. I just use my scarf for a while to lay it flat. It smells great!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It works great on my natual hair. It lays it right down. I usually wear a sew in but i choose not to relax my edges. This stuff gives my edges the sleek and shine of a fresh relaxer and it doesnt sweat or oil out! I reccomend putting it in the refrigerator after use for best repeat results!! Its also best used with a clean scalp . Mutiple applications on top of each other ruins its effectiveness and leaves a white residue that will show up. So wash your edges before each application.</li>
            <li> Definitely need to make sure to rub product in hand or if using a toothbrush for edges less is more or it will look hard and build up. Smells amazing will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Just ok. Holds for about 4 hours on 4c hair. Smells good but will stick with eco styler gel.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for smoothing down the fly-aways when you put your hair up into a bun or ponytail! It smells amazing as well!! It is very sticky, but easy to wash off of your hands.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. At first it may seem sticky, but once you put it in and start smoothing with your fingers, the stickiness is gone. You only need a little bit to get the job done. I love it.</li>
            <li> this stuff works GREAT.  I have natural hair, and it lays it down.  This is the only edge tamer for me!</li>
            <li> I like! It holds longer</li>
            <li> Its just okay. It does lay my hair down a lot better than Jam but as some people have said, it leaves residue.</li>
            <li> Really holds my edges down!</li>
            <li> Was really amazed at how well this slicked my edges. It eventually gets overcome by excessive humidity or workout sweat, but I don&#x27;t expect any tamer to stand up to that. Gave it 4 stars because the ingredient list didn&#x27;t match exactly what was described here and I&#x27;m allergic to castor oil, which it contains.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to. No complaints here!</li>
            <li> It works! and it smells delish! I am writing this review and ordering another one as I write. Don&#x27;t want to run out of this magic edge tamer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used quite a few products to help with the little curly fly aways that I have, and this seems to be the best I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> This product smells really good. However, it leaves my edges dry, dull and dirty looking. Was not impressed. Will be going back to my Holy Grail which is Cream of Nature edge tammer.</li>
            <li> Great for 4c hair!!!!</li>

            <li> I love this for my daughter&#x27;s hair!</li>
            <li> I Love this shea Edge.</li>
