            <li>and it matches perfectly!</li>
            <li>Stay Away from Clairol Perfect 10 !!</li>
            <li>This is the best of them all.  </li>
            <li>It also added great conditioning to my over processed hair!</li>
            <li>The name Perfect 10 refers to it</li>
            <li>Perfect 10 has the perfect shade that covers my gray roots for four weeks or more.  </li>
            <li>It did a great job covering the gray in just 10 minutes though.</li>
            <li>As a first -timer, I was happily impressed with the ease of use and excellent gray coverage.  </li>
            <li>If you are going to buy from Perfect 10, make sure you get a shade lighter than your hair.</li>
            <li>Save your money and avoid the far from perfect \\&quot;Perfect</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good permanent color thats lasts, stays shinny, and is not damaging.</li>
            <li>its too good</li>
            <li>Perfect 10 is really PERFECTO!!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>and I had more of this stuff all over me and the bathroom then on my hair!</li>
            <li>Otherwise its very nice, easy to use</li>
            <li>Great color, great price and fast shipping</li>
            <li>The 10 minute part was nice, but I didnt like the applicator.</li>
            <li>The new Vidal Sasoon hair color is maybe one of the best.</li>
            <li>I just used it tonight for the first time thinking it would be a great produce to color my hair</li>
            <li>and i am so glad i did this color</li>
            <li>and i am glad i did</li>
            <li>My hair looks better shines more and</li>
            <li>I have colored my own hair for over 20 years and have tried just about all the brands available.  </li>
            <li>It has never harmed my hair and has been safe to use as directed.</li>
            <li>The color washed out after 3 washes with color safe shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Not too warm or cool.  </li>
            <li>Love the colors available, Wish the manufacturer was still making 4G</li>
            <li>It may cover grays good and be fast (10mins)</li>
            <li>I had been using nice and easy med blonde and decided to try this perfect 10 In light ash blonde.  </li>
            <li>Since I used an Amazon coupon for my purchase, the cost turned out to be relatively cheap for me.</li>
            <li>I kept the color just to the right time, the application was correct(I have been coloring my hair for more than 9 years now)</li>
            <li>Better to go back to the 25 minute kind.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very dark, but not black, and looks beautiful with my fair skin.  </li>
            <li>I have very cranky grays and was sure that they would not take color...</li>
            <li>I have medium blonde hair with highlights, bought the Clairol Perfect 10 medium blonde just to do a root touch-up.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of different colors and couldnt find the right one I went online and saw this and read good revies so thought i would give it a try</li>
            <li>It is fast and easy to use and gives consistent results.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, frizzy, and fragile, especially after having kids, but this product smoothes out the kinks and leaves your hair feeling so healthy and strong!</li>
            <li>I have tried a few other types of color, and I just don&#x27;t seem to get the same good results as I do with Perfect 10.  </li>
            <li>Its very embarrassing at workplace if your scalp is super</li>
            <li>For some reason, my favorite hair color is getting more and more difficult to find in stores</li>
            <li>It is VERY dark...almost black, but with more washings the color will fade a bit, which is fine with me.</li>
            <li>this is great hair coloring, cover grey wonderfully, not messy like some other products I have tried...very easy to use</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t vouch for it&#x27;s color seal capabilities, but it certainly made my hair feel</li>
            <li>John Freida&#x27;s Foam color is great with very little mess and goes on easy.</li>
            <li>It covers all white hair and it is very fast!!  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t really see any multifaceted results or shine.  </li>
            <li>Although I didn&#x27;t think it suited me very well, I waited 6 months before I decided to color over it.</li>
            <li>Plus, the conditioner they give you lasts forever, and the application brush worked very well to distrubute even color.</li>
            <li>my scalp has become very itchy after I have used this color.</li>
            <li>Now that I have it set up for subscription at every 8 weeks, it comes just as I am ready to color.</li>
            <li>Its perfect bc previous products have left my hair black and this is just the right amount of darkest brown that I need.</li>
            <li>Although it is a nice, soft black with no blue or purple undertones, it is not the color I had originally wanted.</li>
            <li>Overall, the color is very rich and shiny, my hair feels smooth and silky, and has calmed down the friz!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not much of a hair person and when I do this I usually use nice and easy</li>
            <li>I ended up making more of a mess.</li>
            <li>It completely covers all my grey hair and leaves my hair super shiny!</li>
            <li>happily , I was wrong.  </li>
            <li>My shade, Suddenly Sable, is a nice, neutral dark brown.  </li>
            <li>I previously bought the medium brown color (the one with the lovely Asian woman on the box) and it gave me that exact color.</li>
            <li>At this stage the color loss does not bother me so much, because the intention was to bridge the gap between my black roots and the light brown hair color, which I think this product just about managed.  </li>
            <li>It seemed like the color was a little too dark for me even though I use the same color in the nice and easy box.</li>
            <li>Loved the ease of application and lot less waiting time as compared to other drug stores brand.</li>
            <li>I spend 30 minutes in the shower trying to wash off the color and water would not get clear...</li>
            <li>Btw, my hair length is to my shoulders and one box was just enough, so I highly recommend getting two boxes for anything longer than that!</li>
            <li>I use the darkest brown since that is my natural hair color</li>
            <li>I never have had problems and don&#x27;t have sensitive skin or scalp.</li>
            <li>The dye has been gradually washing out over the past month and a half, and I can see some of the light brown hair color that I was originally trying to cover.  </li>
            <li>The processing time is much quicker than most other hair colors and the results last a long time with minimal fading.</li>
            <li>the color last longer compared to the other ones i have tried before which it washes out so quickly</li>
            <li>The color turned out be much darker than expected (very close to black)</li>
            <li>This color is very very dark, not even a recognizable \\&quot;darkest brown\\&quot; color.</li>
            <li>Wow i purchased this item form  amazon not too long</li>
            <li>I am a natural blonde and with age I am getting some Grey&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Dark black color and not Dark Brown!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase this particular dye again, because the performance was average, so</li>

            <li> probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase this particular dye again, because the performance was average, so</li>
            <li> A highly saturated shade of black.  </li>
            <li> I had read many bad reviews for perfect 10 regarding the horrible smell and burning scalp but thought I&#x27;d give this product a chance anyway.  </li>
            <li> Plus, I put myself through all that and the color is blah and didn&#x27;t cover the grey.  </li>
            <li> The smell is absolutely horrible, a very strong chemical smell which should&#x27;ve warned me right away</li>
            <li> My naturally medium brown hair turned black!  </li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t leave your hair black, close, but not definitely the color it claims.</li>
            <li> When I died it, I left the dye in for 10 minutes as instructed, then washed the rest out - and it was indistinguishable from black.</li>
            <li> Second and the biggest complaint is since the last 2 applications-</li>
            <li> Plus, my hair is damaged and falling out at an alarming rate.  </li>
            <li> It also does not stain my face if I am careful and use Vaseoline around my hairline.  </li>
            <li> Why did I not heed the warning from other reviewers?</li>
            <li> taking only 10 minutes instead of the usual 25 minutes.</li>
            <li> That way, it doesn&#x27;t end up too dark.</li>
            <li> But, on a good note, it covered but the horrible highlight job I got done from the salon.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally dark, but not jet black.</li>
            <li> I bought 03 Darkest Brown to cover my existing light-brown salon dye job that was growing out and showing my black roots.</li>
            <li> time, I will use a less drastic color.</li>
            <li> Also, almost, half of my hair fell of in the shower.</li>
            <li> This turned my hair jet black.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to color, and I have trouble finding it in stores.</li>
            <li> Totally horrified at how poor this product is.</li>
            <li> Darkest Brown is actually very very black.</li>
            <li> but this product is a MESS TO USE!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been over a month since I used this product and the harsh color has hardly faded at all.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what&#x27;s up with this dye</li>
            <li> This color, Darkest Brown is hard to find...</li>
            <li> I cranked up the AC and turned on the ceiling fan in the bathroom where I applied Perfect Worst, sprayed the room with air freshener...and that awful smell still lingers.</li>
            <li> I had such a bad experience with this, I am seriously considering never coloring my hair again.</li>
            <li> Firstly it is very hard to procure this brand now.</li>
            <li> FAIL.</li>
            <li> , well i was WRONG.</li>
            <li> This is actually one of the WORST hair colors out there.</li>
            <li> but for some reason its doing something crazy to my scalp.</li>
            <li> Seriously!!!</li>
            <li> WRONG!!</li>
            <li> but, like an idiot, I put it on my hair anyway.</li>
            <li> It smells awful and it leaves a stain on your pillow.</li>

            <li> It covers all white hair and it is very fast!!  Perfect 10 is really PERFECTO!!  And it lasts for 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I bought 03 Darkest Brown to cover my existing light-brown salon dye job that was growing out and showing my black roots. The color turned out be much darker than expected (very close to black) and I didn&#x27;t really see any multifaceted results or shine.  The dye has been gradually washing out over the past month and a half, and I can see some of the light brown hair color that I was originally trying to cover.  At this stage the color loss does not bother me so much, because the intention was to bridge the gap between my black roots and the light brown hair color, which I think this product just about managed.  However, give it another month and I may have to redye it, because it would have all washed out.  I like the fact that the product came with a color seal conditioner.  I can&#x27;t vouch for it&#x27;s color seal capabilities, but it certainly made my hair feel smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase this particular dye again, because the performance was average, so I wouldn&#x27;t mind giving another brand a try.  Since I used an Amazon coupon for my purchase, the cost turned out to be relatively cheap for me.</li>
            <li> I previously bought the medium brown color (the one with the lovely Asian woman on the box) and it gave me that exact color. Although I didn&#x27;t think it suited me very well, I waited 6 months before I decided to color over it. I went with darkest brown and it turned out just like the womans on the box! It is VERY dark...almost black, but with more washings the color will fade a bit, which is fine with me. Overall, the color is very rich and shiny, my hair feels smooth and silky, and has calmed down the friz! My hair is fine, frizzy, and fragile, especially after having kids, but this product smoothes out the kinks and leaves your hair feeling so healthy and strong! I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good permanent color thats lasts, stays shinny, and is not damaging. Plus, the conditioner they give you lasts forever, and the application brush worked very well to distrubute even color. Hope this helps (: Btw, my hair length is to my shoulders and one box was just enough, so I highly recommend getting two boxes for anything longer than that!</li>
            <li> I use the darkest brown since that is my natural hair color and it matches perfectly! It completely covers all my grey hair and leaves my hair super shiny! Its perfect bc previous products have left my hair black and this is just the right amount of darkest brown that I need. Won&#x27;t leave your hair black, close, but not definitely the color it claims.</li>
            <li> Great color, great price and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Wow i purchased this item form  amazon not too long and i am so glad i did this color its too good I have tried a lot of different colors and couldnt find the right one I went online and saw this and read good revies so thought i would give it a try and i am glad i did My hair looks better shines more and the color last longer compared to the other ones i have tried before which it washes out so quickly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of a hair person and when I do this I usually use nice and easy where you wait longer for the color. So I tried this out. The 10 minute part was nice, but I didnt like the applicator. I ended up making more of a mess. Of course I just wasnt used to it. It seemed like the color was a little too dark for me even though I use the same color in the nice and easy box. It did a great job covering the gray in just 10 minutes though. So basically I rated it 3 atars cuz of the applicator and the shade, and the price.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a darker color for my hair, so I chose the darkest brown kit. When I died it, I left the dye in for 10 minutes as instructed, then washed the rest out - and it was indistinguishable from black. After 3-4 days, the color lightened up to the &amp;#34;darkest brown&amp;#34; shade promised by the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time, I will use a less drastic color.</li>
            <li> My naturally medium brown hair turned black!  A highly saturated shade of black.  It&#x27;s been over a month since I used this product and the harsh color has hardly faded at all.  Plus, my hair is damaged and falling out at an alarming rate.  Save your money and avoid the far from perfect \\&quot;Perfect 10.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Love the colors available, Wish the manufacturer was still making 4G</li>
            <li> My Box Color Said Darkest Brown, My Hair Color Result Was Blue/Black&lt;br /&gt;I am not happy.&lt;br /&gt;I would never use this again.</li>
            <li> I have used color on my hair for years. I never have had problems and don&#x27;t have sensitive skin or scalp. I had read many bad reviews for perfect 10 regarding the horrible smell and burning scalp but thought I&#x27;d give this product a chance anyway.  I have medium blonde hair with highlights, bought the Clairol Perfect 10 medium blonde just to do a root touch-up. I&#x27;ve never had problems with hair color before so assumed this would be no different. WRONG!! The smell is absolutely horrible, a very strong chemical smell which should&#x27;ve warned me right away but, like an idiot, I put it on my hair anyway. That was four hours ago, two hair washes, and my scalp is still burning. Even my hands are burning and I wore gloves!!  The smell won&#x27;t go away either.  I cranked up the AC and turned on the ceiling fan in the bathroom where I applied Perfect Worst, sprayed the room with air freshener...and that awful smell still lingers. My hair smells like a chemical dump and looks fried.  Plus, I put myself through all that and the color is blah and didn&#x27;t cover the grey.  Why did I not heed the warning from other reviewers? So it&#x27;s my turn to warn you....Stay Away from Clairol Perfect 10 !! It should be taken off the market. What in the world is in that stuff?  I had such a bad experience with this, I am seriously considering never coloring my hair again. Seriously!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost 1 year. Loved the ease of application and lot less waiting time as compared to other drug stores brand. But I have 2 Big complaints- Firstly it is very hard to procure this brand now. Stores in my area don&#x27;t carry it anymore. From Walmart to Target- Ralphs- CVS- Walgreens, I have to go everywhere. if I am in luck then sometimes I can find it in Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Second and the biggest complaint is since the last 2 applications- my scalp has become very itchy after I have used this color. I kept the color just to the right time, the application was correct(I have been coloring my hair for more than 9 years now) but for some reason its doing something crazy to my scalp. Its very embarrassing at workplace if your scalp is super itchy.- And no I have NO Dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color lasts for almost 2 weeks for me after that it fades from the length. Roots , however show after about 10 days</li>
            <li> Color 03 Darkest Brown is actually very very black. Otherwise its very nice, easy to use</li>
            <li> I have colored my own hair for over 20 years and have tried just about all the brands available.  This is the best of them all.  It is the easiest to use.  It also does not stain my face if I am careful and use Vaseoline around my hairline.  Perfect 10 has the perfect shade that covers my gray roots for four weeks or more.  It has never harmed my hair and has been safe to use as directed.</li>
            <li> this is great hair coloring, cover grey wonderfully, not messy like some other products I have tried...very easy to use</li>
            <li> The reason why I am giving one star only, is because after following all the instructions, my hair turned into &amp;#34;Black&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;!!! Dark black color and not Dark Brown!!!!!!! Also, almost, half of my hair fell of in the shower. I spend 30 minutes in the shower trying to wash off the color and water would not get clear... Not sure what&#x27;s up with this dye but I am definitely staying away from it from now on!</li>
            <li> I am a natural blonde and with age I am getting some Grey&#x27;s.  I had been using nice and easy med blonde and decided to try this perfect 10 In light ash blonde.  The color washed out after 3 washes with color safe shampoo. FAIL.</li>
            <li> Love it! As a first -timer, I was happily impressed with the ease of use and excellent gray coverage.  I have very cranky grays and was sure that they would not take color...happily , I was wrong.  It also added great conditioning to my over processed hair!</li>
            <li> This is my go-to color, and I have trouble finding it in stores. Now that I have it set up for subscription at every 8 weeks, it comes just as I am ready to color. It is fast and easy to use and gives consistent results.</li>
            <li> This color is very very dark, not even a recognizable \\&quot;darkest brown\\&quot; color. This turned my hair jet black. Although it is a nice, soft black with no blue or purple undertones, it is not the color I had originally wanted.</li>
            <li> For some reason, my favorite hair color is getting more and more difficult to find in stores so I have started ordering it from Amazon.  I have tried a few other types of color, and I just don&#x27;t seem to get the same good results as I do with Perfect 10.  My shade, Suddenly Sable, is a nice, neutral dark brown.  Not too warm or cool.  It&#x27;s very dark, but not black, and looks beautiful with my fair skin.  The processing time is much quicker than most other hair colors and the results last a long time with minimal fading.</li>
            <li> This is the only hair dye brand which will cover my white hair and I&#x27;ve tried A LOT.  The fact that it can do it in only 10 minutes is an added bonus!</li>
            <li> It may cover grays good and be fast (10mins) but this product is a MESS TO USE! I just used it tonight for the first time thinking it would be a great produce to color my hair and I had more of this stuff all over me and the bathroom then on my hair! I have been coloring my hair for YEARS and have used John Freida&#x27;s color foam hair color but for some reason decided to try something different, well i was WRONG. I have never had this happen to me with the foam color I used before and I am going back to that next time I color my hair . Totally horrified at how poor this product is. John Freida&#x27;s Foam color is great with very little mess and goes on easy. Love it.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally dark, but not jet black. This made my hair way darker than what it should be. But, on a good note, it covered but the horrible highlight job I got done from the salon. If you are going to buy from Perfect 10, make sure you get a shade lighter than your hair. That way, it doesn&#x27;t end up too dark.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the product!</li>
            <li> The name Perfect 10 refers to it taking only 10 minutes instead of the usual 25 minutes. This is actually one of the WORST hair colors out there. It smells awful and it leaves a stain on your pillow. Better to go back to the 25 minute kind. The new Vidal Sasoon hair color is maybe one of the best.</li>
            <li> This color, Darkest Brown is hard to find... My wife loves it.... so the search is on ...</li>
