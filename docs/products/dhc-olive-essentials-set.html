            <li>now I&#x27;ve gotten a little bit cheap when it comes to ordering products  from their website, and they&#x27;re so expensive to ship directly to me, so I decided to check Amazon and see if they carry the items and of course they did!I love their items so much and being over 50 years of age and skin is not quite as soft as it used to be I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on how cleat and smooth my skin looks, and I would not be caught dead anywhere without it!</li>

            <li> DHC products are my favorite. Tried others and always come back.</li>
            <li> This very much a senior who rides motorcycle thousands of miles every year ,is so thankful a friend shared this product with me . It has not only help heal and smooth my damaged facial skin it has lifted my aged spirits . There is hope for a smoother , bright more youthful skin and it is DHC . Anxious to try more of their products.</li>
            <li> Unlike anything I have ever used.  I use the soap on my face in the shower and the oil at the sink to wash my face.</li>
            <li> To begin with, I have extremely dry skin and a lot breakouts. I tried this product out and I am more than satisfied with it. My skin looks and feel so much better, soft and supple after only a week. The acne and its scare is also fading. The deep cleansing oil does the great job and the soap keeps my skin amazingly clean. The product definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> All of the products in this set are wonderful.  I received samples in the mail and was sold.  The deep cleansing oil shrank the pores on my nose immediately.  It is not a substitute for a facial, however!  The soap is gentle and so refreshing. It leaves my mature skin soft and smooth. The toner closes the pores and firms. I only use the olive oil moisturizer at night because I don&#x27;t wear makeup and it does leave your skin shiny.  I use another moisturizer with SPF during the day.  Great products!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. My skin gets SO clean and soft. So glad I found it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using DHC olive oil essential set for about 9 years now I&#x27;ve gotten a little bit cheap when it comes to ordering products  from their website, and they&#x27;re so expensive to ship directly to me, so I decided to check Amazon and see if they carry the items and of course they did!I love their items so much and being over 50 years of age and skin is not quite as soft as it used to be I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on how cleat and smooth my skin looks, and I would not be caught dead anywhere without it! if I was stranded on an island, this is the product is is definitely a must have in my pocket! Thank you Amazon for providing me with such a fine product.</li>
            <li> Extremely happy with the products.  They are high quality and make my skin look amazing!  Quick shipping and great packaging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted to try this system for years and finally decided to invest in it for a month. I&#x27;ve been very impressed with the cleansing factor and my skin has never felt so soft. I plan to re- purchase this  when I run out. It looks as if this shipment is going to last a good bit longer than one month. I only use it one a day, though. It&#x27;s still going to last at least two months. I&#x27;m very happy with it..</li>
            <li> Works amazing, but still don&#x27;t use as often as my purity.</li>
            <li> The set is nice and works for me. Love the Virgil oil and the toner. However, although I do love the cleansin oil, it cannot be used for eye makeup remover as the oil eventually seeps in and makes my eyes watery. It doesn&#x27;t sting, but not good for eyes. Otherwise it&#x27;s a great product and will order again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used DHC products in the past and am reminded of why I liked them in the first place. The deep cleaning oil is not just for makeup removal and does clean without making your skin feel oily. I love love love the oilive soap - my skin feels soft and silky after use and the remainder of the products just increase that clean soft feeling. DHC has great products for everyone and I would highly recommend them to all age groups.</li>
            <li> The products included were a bit too drying on top of using the oil. I like the oil alone. The oil doesn&#x27;t completely take off my makeup ( i dont use heavy heavy foundation so im not sure why that is) so I use it twice sometimes or use a gentle cleanser after it too.</li>
            <li> While I only searched for the deep cleansing oil, I though the set a better value and decided to try it. The products are not bad, but they aren&#x27;t my favorite either. I have fairly dry skin and found the Olive Virgin Oil to be too greasy to wear under makeup, and even too greasy for nighttime use - it doesn&#x27;t soak in the skin, but leaves a greasy film over the skin.  I&#x27;ll purchase the cleansing oil again and again, but definitely skip the rest.</li>
            <li> This poduct is worth every penny. The cleanser, the soap and the toner work wonders on my skin. My skin looks younger and it feels healthy and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I would say, this set is the one of the best facial routine I&#x27;ve done in awhile. I&#x27;ve been using this absolutely amazing cleansing oil for over 5 years. This facial soap really cleans well and feel fresh and won&#x27;t dry your skin. The lotion keeps your skin rejuvenate, softer and moist, I love this so much! Finally, the olive oil, it seriously supple your skin all day and night long. This set will last a long time about 6 months except the lotion, the lotion run out in about 2, 3 months if you use it day and night. Highly recommend. (FYI: I&#x27;m 40 years old, fair light skin tone Asian, mixed type skin)</li>
            <li> I have &#x27;combo&#x27; face issues, although the oily seems to keep me looking younger than my age(51).  This is the first product that works on both without turning me into an oil factory.  My cheeks are nice n soft and my flaky eyebrows AREN&#x27;T any more Woo Hoo.  Also my skin isn&#x27;t doing the hyper sensitive redness that usually happens right after washing.  Would suggest trying the samples to any and all.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I have struggled withy skin since I was a teen. I love it!</li>
            <li> Its a really nice package!&lt;br /&gt;I used everything but the soap and got really nice results.&lt;br /&gt;I probably would just buy the cleanser and moisturizer again though.</li>
            <li> I am a middle age women, with dull skin large pores uneven skin tones and combo of oily, dry and flaky.  I have used the DHC Olive Essentials Set for a month and am pleased with the difference I&#x27;m seeing in the mirror. I am very hopeful that things will only improve the longer I use these products!</li>
            <li> I really love the deep cleansing oil make up remover so I thought I would try out this set but I have combination skin and the rest of this system has caused non stop breakouts. I was really surprised from the reviews I had read about it before purchasing. I think this may be a great skin care system for someone with dry skin but I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this products again, they are the best. They may look pricey but they last a long time.</li>
