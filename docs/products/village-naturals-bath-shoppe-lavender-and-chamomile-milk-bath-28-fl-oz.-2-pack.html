            <li> My wife likes to pamper, and this liquid smellie is a nice bath add-to that isn&#x27;t overpowering and is pleasant, even for a man.</li>
            <li> The most important quality of bubble bath is HOW LONG do the bubbles last?  Bubbles that dissolve two minutes after you get in the bath are not what you want!  This bubble bath has bubbles that last the whole bath, and I take long bubble baths.  There are still plenty of bubbles after 45 minutes, and the fragrance is wonderful, too.  Very nice lavender smell.  All in all, my favorite bubble bath and worth ordering by mail.</li>
            <li> this smells great but you do need to use quite a bit to fill the bath with bubbles. it leaves skin soft but slightly filmy so you should probably rinse off with clean water if you have sensitive skin because it can leave you itchy.</li>
            <li> I found this by chance at a local store and thought to give it a try.  I am glad I did. As you can see from the photo, this milk bath provides quality, shape holding foam/bubbles.  That is nothing to scoff at.  I have not yet had an inclination to make a Santa Bubble Beard, but I have no doubt that I could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a great balance of being subtle but apparent.  It is implied with undertones of lavender.  It is not the sharp lavender scent you would get from English milled soaps, but it is still lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The additives leave my skin feeling nice but not overdone.  I also do not notice a film build up in the tub after use, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One hang up I have is that the recommended use amount is listed in ounces instead of capfuls.  I, for one, do not know what 3 ounces looks like pouring from a bath bottle.  However, my bubble surface coverage based on my eyeball estimations has been satisfactory. If you demand a more precise bathing experience, you can use a kitchen measuring cup.  Besides, bath and bubble specs often vary by individual preferences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am happy with this product. If I cannot find it local when I run out, I will purchase it online.</li>

            <li> I can beat the price by $5 so this was one and only time</li>
            <li> its a great product, but if you just go to your local Wally world, your going to save a LOT of money. This is no deal</li>

            <li> Love this product!  This body wash is perfect for a long luxurious bath after a long day or hike or just for the cold winter (much needed here in Minnesota)!  This is my go to bath bubbles and all purpose both wash; it leaves me moisturized.  It&#x27;s just too bad that my Target store doesn&#x27;t carry them anymore and I have them them online for 3 times the price. &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> Affordable bubble bath, great relaxing smell, lots of bubbles. I keep this brand stocked in my bathroom!</li>
            <li> My wife loved this bubble bath.  She said the shea butter made this product better than other brands.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  It really takes a lot of the bubble bath to make a good pile of bubbles.  I could use up a bottle of this in two weeks.</li>
            <li> First time for this particular item, very good</li>
            <li> I buy this all the time and love it.  Very fragrant without driving you out of the bathroom.  Lots of bubbles and soothing.</li>

            <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loves it.  Then I tried it.  It has a very nice aroma and I was left with a silky feel to my skin.  The only thing is that we agree that we would have liked more bubbles.  You need to use quite a bit to get a decent amount of bubbles.</li>
