            <li>The Mirror  gives perfect light and magnification.</li>
            <li>Light is just the perfect amount.  </li>
            <li>I can see more than I want to see!  </li>
            <li>Just get one with a bright light!</li>
            <li>My husband even commented that it was a nice mirror</li>
            <li>Love, love it!</li>
            <li>Great mirror, bright light allows very good viewing for makeup application, stray facial hairs, etc.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Why is good illumination so important for a magnifying mirror?</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>light is really nice though.</li>
            <li>This is because fluorescent tubes are 3-4 times more efficient than incandescent bulbs.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this mirror...</li>
            <li>I love this mirror.</li>
            <li>Better to be able to leave plug in all the time.</li>
            <li>I dropped the first one I owned after having it many years and loved it.  </li>
            <li>but I think I overplucked because I was so excited I could see my eye!  </li>
            <li>I was expecting a lot more light than I am getting.    </li>
            <li>light isnt as bright as i hoped but it works good enough</li>
            <li>This is the perfect mirror for grooming brows and other strays.</li>
            <li>The delivery on this was very quick and efficient.</li>
            <li>Amazon very quickly processed the return, but with a lot of deductions.</li>
            <li>Makes it so easy to see any imperfections in your makeup and skin.  </li>
            <li>but it is still going strong.  </li>
            <li>Floxite products are a must for anyone with less than perfect eyesight.  </li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t had any issues with the light.  </li>
            <li>Received this mirror and it is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>But there is one important difference between their light sources.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is rated for 24W (12V*2A) and generates about 350 lumens of light</li>
            <li>I wish it was available in a stronger X&#x27;s&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, if you are a carny and don&#x27;t care about the light part, then go for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The light does not work on arrival.</li>
            <li>I advise seller to check the working of the light (electrical quality) of this unit.</li>
            <li>Had this mirror for years, light could be brighter.</li>
            <li>need a better  cord for such a good mirror.</li>
            <li>but you have to be right on top of it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works fine for me and is bright enough.  </li>
            <li>but the light just isn&#x27;t bright enough.</li>
            <li>cant put makeup on in front of this because it is super magnified</li>
            <li>the light in this mirror worked for the first day</li>
            <li>I was amazed (and dismayed) at all the plucking opportunities I discovered upon looking into it for the first time!  </li>
            <li>Applying makeup, tweezing my brows etc... has been made so much handier with this light.  </li>
            <li>The mirror is really nice --- just what I needed, but it is bigger than I thought.  </li>
            <li>Also useful for flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the same #1156 turn-signal light bulb used in many cars.</li>
            <li>As it appears in the ads, this is a large mirror with very good magnification and very little distortion.</li>
            <li>The morrow is 10 times but the light on it is so dim you don&#x27;t get a true reflection  </li>
            <li>This is the 2nd mirror I&#x27;ve owned by this manufacturer and we love it.  </li>
            <li>[...]I first tried the Floxite mirror while on vacation with friends.   </li>
            <li>Go to Bed Bath &amp; Beyond with a 20% off coupon and get one that is 100 times better for almost the same price.</li>
            <li>I chose a different Floxite product and am quite pleased.  </li>
            <li>The mid range view is distorted, I had the thought that it was going to be a bit of a better mirror for the price..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Given that the two products are priced similarly, and the optical quality of mirrors are identical, I feel that the one with fluorescent tube is a much better value.</li>
            <li>For lack of being able to find a new bulb for my old mirror, I purchased this Floxite mirror to replace it.  </li>
            <li>Bright light also makes your pupils contract, which allows people with poor eyesight to focus much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have had Floxlite&#x27;s in the past and they are good, except the electrical connector kept going out.</li>
            <li>The bulb lasted for several years and when it went out, I ordered two new ones for very cheap price.</li>
            <li>Being of a certain age (55+)</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who wants a smart value.</li>
            <li>Also, the part you plug into the outlet is very large, gets quite warm and is VERY heavy.  </li>
            <li>Not the least bit bright.</li>
            <li>It is rated for only 22W, but generates a much brighter light at 1050 lumens.</li>
            <li>Not too much.  </li>
            <li>The price was reasonable for this quality mirror</li>
            <li>I really like this mirror.</li>
            <li>If you wear false lashes like I do, it&#x27;s great for applying them.  </li>
            <li>the magnification is high quality in the mirror and not distorted, there is not enough light to see by from this product.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t see all the little hairs and I have to use a flashlight beside me to have it bright enough...</li>
            <li>it has only ONE magnification ONE SIDED&amp;#34; SUPER DOOPER MAGNIFIED!!!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this mirror.</li>
            <li>Therefore you really need much stronger light to illuminate the subject (your face).</li>
            <li>but I expected a brighter light.</li>
            <li>The mirror has enough distortion to belong in a carnival fun house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also the plug is enormous and weighs almost as much as the mirror itself - can&#x27;t be used in a multi-outlet plug-in unless it&#x27;s a large power strip.  </li>
            <li>I will have to order a new plug for it</li>
            <li>Works great for my wife, would Gove 5 but plug at light is a little difficult to plug and unplug.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re not comfortable with seeing your every pore, stray hair, and fine line</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MIRROR.</li>
            <li>Also the curve was to deep and had to get very up close to see face.</li>
            <li>Mirror]]\\&quot;) looks nearly identical to the \\&quot;[[ASIN:B001FS0HAY Daylight Fluorescent Lighted Portable</li>
            <li>mirror&#x27;s circular light, however, does very little to provide illumination.  </li>
            <li>the light, which is not bright enough, you would think it was a device you would have on your vanity (which means a reasonable distance from your face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First, there was a lot of distortion in the mirror; secondly the bulb burned out the second time I turned it on; and thirdly the adapter/plug became very hot after being plugged in for just a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>Its hard enough to need this magnification but the light it very low</li>
            <li>Tithe light is not bright at all.</li>
            <li>I have other Floxite products that I cannot live without, but this mirror is lit with an incandescent light surrounding the mirror and is not bright enough at all.  </li>
            <li>I only wish it flipped to normal magnification on the other side -</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s hard to use as a makeup mirror with that much magnification.  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had it that long.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t owned very long and cord has shorted out already</li>
            <li> Just received this 10x magnification mirror because I can&#x27;t see without glasses and prior mirror was not strong enough for me to see my eyes without glasses.  </li>
            <li> Tubes also last about 10 time longer than bulbs (typically 12,000 hours vs. 1200</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> product was not what i expected</li>
            <li> plug is coming apart even with careful use.</li>
            <li> Is not very lighted.</li>
            <li> when new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other product uses a circular fluorescent tube around the mirror for illumination.</li>

            <li> The mirror is really nice --- just what I needed, but it is bigger than I thought.  It does say vanity mirror, but the info said great for traveling???  It is definitely what it says a vanity mirror.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd mirror I&#x27;ve owned by this manufacturer and we love it.  It&#x27;s the only way to apply makeup and replace contact lenses.  I dropped the first one I owned after having it many years and loved it.  The delivery on this was very quick and efficient.</li>
            <li> Works as expected. Don&#x27;t need my glasses to put my makeup on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this mirror for three years now and I love it.  I didn&#x27;t get it from Amazon but it is still going strong.  This is the perfect mirror for grooming brows and other strays. If you wear false lashes like I do, it&#x27;s great for applying them.  Being of a certain age (55+) I can get those lashes on perfectly. It&#x27;s also good for contact wearers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re not comfortable with seeing your every pore, stray hair, and fine line then this may not be the mirror for you.  This is strictly a close-up situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the light.  It works fine for me and is bright enough.  Now it&#x27;s time for me to buy a 10x travel mirror.</li>
            <li> great company would use again!  product was not what i expected</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this mirror. The magnification is very good. The lighting is terrible. It is very hard for me to see. I was expecting a lot more light than I am getting.    If you have trouble seeing as I do please don&#x27;t expect this mirror to help you. It won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Just received this 10x magnification mirror because I can&#x27;t see without glasses and prior mirror was not strong enough for me to see my eyes without glasses.  Received this mirror and it is fantastic.  I can see more than I want to see!  As soon as I got it, I plucked my eyebrows but I think I overplucked because I was so excited I could see my eye!  My husband even commented that it was a nice mirror but he didn&#x27;t like what he saw!  Would definitely recommend for people that can&#x27;t see without glasses to apply makeup.  Also useful for flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 09/2012--Okay. Well 3 years after purchasing, this mirror&#x27;s cord has given out. Mirror doesn&#x27;t work anymore...cord has short in it.</li>
            <li> [...]I first tried the Floxite mirror while on vacation with friends.   My best friend said that she found it invaluable.   Now I know why.   Applying makeup, tweezing my brows etc... has been made so much handier with this light.  I&#x27;ve even had comments that my makeup looks great since buying this mirror.   I would recommend it to anyone who wants a smart value.</li>
            <li> For lack of being able to find a new bulb for my old mirror, I purchased this Floxite mirror to replace it.  As it appears in the ads, this is a large mirror with very good magnification and very little distortion. It also arrived very quickly following my order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror&#x27;s circular light, however, does very little to provide illumination.  In fact, it might as well have no light at all, since I can see just as well with it turned off as I can when it&#x27;s turned on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed and would not recommend this product for anyone who, like me, needs (and expects) a light.</li>
            <li> This is a great mirror - I was amazed (and dismayed) at all the plucking opportunities I discovered upon looking into it for the first time!  I only wish it flipped to normal magnification on the other side - it&#x27;s hard to use as a makeup mirror with that much magnification.  Also the plug is enormous and weighs almost as much as the mirror itself - can&#x27;t be used in a multi-outlet plug-in unless it&#x27;s a large power strip.  But good for the price.</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh!!! This mirror looked like one that I have so I ordered it for my daughter. Looks can be deceiving. My mirror has a circular flourescent bulb. This one has a little bulb like a turn signal or something. Not the least bit bright. And the cost was almost what I paid for mine. I returned it. Too bad I loose $5.00 for the return shipping. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MIRROR. Go to Bed Bath &amp; Beyond with a 20% off coupon and get one that is 100 times better for almost the same price.</li>
            <li> I have other Floxite products that I cannot live without, but this mirror is lit with an incandescent light surrounding the mirror and is not bright enough at all.  Althought the magnification is high quality in the mirror and not distorted, there is not enough light to see by from this product.  Also, the part you plug into the outlet is very large, gets quite warm and is VERY heavy.  Not convenient for travel.  I chose a different Floxite product and am quite pleased.  Floxite products are a must for anyone with less than perfect eyesight.  Make-up application and tweezing are a breeze with their mirrors.  Just get one with a bright light!</li>
            <li> I returned the Floxite Lighted Vanity Mirror for three reasons.  First, there was a lot of distortion in the mirror; secondly the bulb burned out the second time I turned it on; and thirdly the adapter/plug became very hot after being plugged in for just a few minutes.  Amazon very quickly processed the return, but with a lot of deductions.</li>
            <li> The morrow is 10 times but the light on it is so dim you don&#x27;t get a true reflection  it&#x27;s hard to see when putting on your makeup</li>
            <li> light isnt as bright as i hoped but it works good enough</li>
            <li> the light in this mirror worked for the first day I got it, then that was it. I sent it back.</li>
            <li> have owned 2 now , and both times, the plug end of the cord gets a short and no longer works .They need a better  cord for such a good mirror.</li>
            <li> The mid range view is distorted, I had the thought that it was going to be a bit of a better mirror for the price..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light is really nice though.</li>
            <li> I returned it as not bright enough for me.  Also the curve was to deep and had to get very up close to see face.</li>
            <li> The item offered here (\\&quot;[[ASIN:B001FRQ78Q 10x Magnifying Circle LiteTM lighted Mirror]]\\&quot;) looks nearly identical to the \\&quot;[[ASIN:B001FS0HAY Daylight Fluorescent Lighted Portable 10X Mirror]]\\&quot; made by the same company. But there is one important difference between their light sources.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product here uses a 12V incandescent bulb for illumination. This is the same #1156 turn-signal light bulb used in many cars. It is rated for 24W (12V*2A) and generates about 350 lumens of light when new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other product uses a circular fluorescent tube around the mirror for illumination. It is rated for only 22W, but generates a much brighter light at 1050 lumens. This is because fluorescent tubes are 3-4 times more efficient than incandescent bulbs. Tubes also last about 10 time longer than bulbs (typically 12,000 hours vs. 1200 hours).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is good illumination so important for a magnifying mirror? When the image in the mirror is magnified, its brightness decreases proportionally. Therefore you really need much stronger light to illuminate the subject (your face). Bright light also makes your pupils contract, which allows people with poor eyesight to focus much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given that the two products are priced similarly, and the optical quality of mirrors are identical, I feel that the one with fluorescent tube is a much better value.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this mirror...it is my second one</li>
            <li> I have had Floxlite&#x27;s in the past and they are good, except the electrical connector kept going out. I just bought this one and the mirror is great but the light just isn&#x27;t bright enough. Can&#x27;t see all the little hairs and I have to use a flashlight beside me to have it bright enough...</li>
            <li> Its hard enough to need this magnification but the light it very low and you have to be 1\\&quot; away to use it.&lt;br /&gt;With the light, which is not bright enough, you would think it was a device you would have on your vanity (which means a reasonable distance from your face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mag is 10x but you have to be right on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have returned it if it wasn&#x27;t such a pain to do so.</li>
            <li> I wish it was available in a stronger X&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;The plug is coming apart even with careful use. I will have to order a new plug for it and I haven&#x27;t had it that long.</li>
            <li> Just what we wanted great</li>
            <li> Is not very lighted. Not pleased.</li>
            <li> Wow!  How wonderful to be able to SEE my face.  I can&#x27;t tell you how happy I am with my purchase of this one!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great mirror, bright light allows very good viewing for makeup application, stray facial hairs, etc.  Highly recommend this mirror.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror. My last floxite mirror lasted me well over 10 years. Its a great value and now I can see every hair!!</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife for Christmas as it was on her wish list.  She set it up the next day, plugged it in and it doesn&#x27;t work.  Of course the box got thrown out with all the Christmas detritus.  :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheaply made.  The mirror has enough distortion to belong in a carnival fun house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  It&#x27;s your typical made-in-China piece of crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you are a carny and don&#x27;t care about the light part, then go for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could give it zero stars, I would.</li>
            <li> This mirror is great.  Makes it so easy to see any imperfections in your makeup and skin.  Love, love it!</li>
            <li> it has only ONE magnification ONE SIDED&amp;#34; SUPER DOOPER MAGNIFIED!!!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I cant put makeup on in front of this because it is super magnified, It works WELL for PLUCKING EYEBROWS though!</li>
            <li> The Mirror  gives perfect light and magnification. The mirror is everything that I hoped for, it also helps my grandson put bands on his braces. No batteries make it a great item, if you&#x27;re looking for an excellent  Mirror this is the one.</li>
            <li> Like it, you can see every thing in this mirror</li>
            <li> great mirror good deal</li>
            <li> The light does not work on arrival. AC-DC adaptor no 12V DC voltage. I checked with a multi meter. Hence NO lighted mirror.. I advise seller to check the working of the light (electrical quality) of this unit.</li>
            <li> Had this mirror for years, light could be brighter. I solved that with having a table lamp on behind it. The bulb lasted for several years and when it went out, I ordered two new ones for very cheap price. The mirror is great, you can see every inch to apply makeup evenly.</li>
            <li> did not like the lighting - not bright enough</li>
            <li> Great Mirror for the price!  Light is just the perfect amount.  Not too much.  Not too little.</li>
            <li> Works great for my wife, would Gove 5 but plug at light is a little difficult to plug and unplug. Better to be able to leave plug in all the time.</li>
            <li> wife likes it so you know I like it lol</li>
            <li> Not good quality.  Haven&#x27;t owned very long and cord has shorted out already</li>
            <li> Tithe light is not bright at all. The price was reasonable for this quality mirror but I expected a brighter light.</li>
            <li> I really like this mirror.</li>
