            <li>I use mine all the time, and I just love it.</li>
            <li>For everything else, there are better products out there.</li>
            <li>So easy to see what is inside.</li>
            <li>For $7 it works just fine.  </li>
            <li>for organizing what I need they are fine</li>
            <li>They are medium weight and can fit inside a child&#x27;s bookbag to take home or be carried with handle.</li>
            <li>, it appears cheap but serviceable.  </li>
            <li>(someday I&#x27;ll post a photo with one filled.)</li>
            <li>I work for a company that polices have changed about how to bring in personal belongings and this works great.</li>
            <li>BUT the zippers are cheap.</li>
            <li>And can be wiped clean.</li>
            <li>34;City Lights Carry-All Make Up Bag, Large, Clear&amp;#34; from this seller as I think it would serve my purposes better.</li>
            <li>However, I assumed the side pockets were the full length of each side with the openings just placed halfway.</li>

            <li> Or at least mine seems to be, although the zipper split open on first examination.  </li>
            <li> it didnt last long.</li>
            <li> It may not last 200 years but it will keep your papers dry while bike commuting, etc.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t seem to serve any purpose, and it introduces a line of holes which I suspect will wind up being the first failure point (not counting the zipper).</li>
            <li> I do wonder why a line of stitching was added across the bottom, in the middle of a single sheet of plastic...</li>
            <li> This is not so, the side pockets are just the lower half of the &amp;#34;briefcase.&amp;#34; I guess if you need to put something bigger than the height of the side pocket, it just has to go into the middle, unsecured.</li>
            <li> The zipper was broken and a seam was ripped, right out of the box.  </li>
            <li> The inside zippers came right off on the first zip :(</li>
            <li> I have a similarly sized makeup organizer by Con***ts that does have side pockets with opening zippers about halfway down</li>
            <li> After just two used the large zipper is now broken and unusable.</li>
            <li> With this bag, expect all your contents to be in the bottom half of the bag and no real usable storage space above the zippers halfway down.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I would not order this again nor would I recommend for storing anything other than maybe paper and pencils.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lower quality than the average cosmetic tote from the drugstore (thinner plastic, iffy stitching)</li>
            <li> The black lines you see halfway down the sides are pockets, which I understood before I ordered.</li>
            <li> I carry thermoses and food that have previously leaked.  </li>
            <li> No more shopping plastic bags that leak.</li>
            <li> it only took two days  broken and sewing of the sides was not good...</li>
            <li> When it arrived one of the inside zippers was broken.</li>
            <li> Zippers are not great, I had one come off almost immediately</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> quality was very poor.</li>
            <li> So if he can&#x27;t see where something is he will forget about it, or get really frustrated that he can&#x27;t find it.  </li>
            <li> I was verrrrry disappointed with the quality of this item.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use this tote for travelling. It holds all my bathroom items so that I only need one bag. I one had a liquid item leak and the tote did not leak into my suitcase.  I have the smaller versions of this type as well and they are great. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m astonished at the complaints about this product.  For $7 it works just fine.  It may not last 200 years but it will keep your papers dry while bike commuting, etc.  I have several and find them VERY useful.  The stitching, plastic weight, and construction are not nearly as bad as suggested by other reviewers.</li>
            <li> Promptly delivered and it&#x27;s a great product for travel.</li>
            <li> This is a great case for those oversized bottles you can never find a bag for.  No more shopping plastic bags that leak.</li>
            <li> I ordered ten of these totes to make take home literacy bags for my elementary classroom.  I love them!  I like the clear totes.  I put a label in the zipper compartment so that the title can be read from the outside telling what the bag is about.  So far, I have made a Lincoln/Washington bag, Tooth bag, rainforest bag, birthday bag, frog bag, zoo animals bag, pets bag, and princess bag.I put 4 or 5 picture books in each with a listing inside about the contents so that my students can take them home and read with family.  I am so happy with these!  I can&#x27;t wait to send them home.  I am ordering ten more to make more literacy bags.  I can change books as the children read at different levels.  They are medium weight and can fit inside a child&#x27;s bookbag to take home or be carried with handle.</li>
            <li> Just purchased my 6-7 bag, so I have now moved into the &amp;#34;several&amp;#34; category. Bag for buck on this bag is high. For travel, or bathroom &amp;#34;extras&amp;#34; storage, they keep everything neat and tidy and easy to find.</li>
            <li> I got this as a Christmas gift for my wife. She likes it very much so I am happy as well. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The size of this product is perfect. When it arrived one of the inside zippers was broken. After just two used the large zipper is now broken and unusable.</li>
            <li> BOUGHT THIS FOR MY SON (6YRS) TO HAUL BOOKS, COLORING BOOKS AND CRAYONS AND IT HOLDS UP NICELY. HE WANTED SOMETHING THAT LOOKED LIKE A BRIEFCASE LIKE DADDY&#x27;S...LOL. PLASTIC IS THICKER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.</li>
            <li> Actual size, stretching and measuring as generously as possible, is 13.75 x 10.25 x 2.75.  Also, you probably already figured this out, but it&#x27;s a cosmetic tote, not a &amp;#34;briefcase&amp;#34;.  Still, if you want a cosmetic tote with those measurements, it&#x27;s serviceable.  Or at least mine seems to be, although the zipper split open on first examination.  It appears to be just because the zipper&#x27;s bottom slipped out of its stitching, so a couple of stitches will fix it.  Other than that, it appears cheap but serviceable.  It&#x27;s lower quality than the average cosmetic tote from the drugstore (thinner plastic, iffy stitching) but it&#x27;s a bit bigger.  The handles are made of webbing.  I do wonder why a line of stitching was added across the bottom, in the middle of a single sheet of plastic...it doesn&#x27;t seem to serve any purpose, and it introduces a line of holes which I suspect will wind up being the first failure point (not counting the zipper).</li>
            <li> I have come back to buy a second one of these totes and found that I never left a review the first time. Well, here it is. This is GREAT!! I use it for my art supplies, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It holds a large, thick art journal as well as many other things. It has pockets inside for small things like pencils (my pockets are packed with about 40 colored markers) and it&#x27;s well made.... zips easily, seems are all well sewn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to get more to use for paperwork. (I already use one for my artwork and it hold a LOT of stuff.) Good for mail and bill storage, etc since you can see with a quick glance what you&#x27;ve stored in each one. I think these are perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for kids toys also!! I don&#x27;t understand why there are so many low reviews. It is just what it looks like only larger than you&#x27;d expect. (someday I&#x27;ll post a photo with one filled.)</li>
            <li> I was verrrrry disappointed with the quality of this item.  The picture gives a TOTALLY different representation of this item. Too costly to return.  BUYER BEWARE</li>
            <li> Works great for my tools. I have special tools that I use rarely but don&#x27;t want to lose. Cable TV and network tools and connectors.&lt;br /&gt;I searched for a clear bag with a handle so I could see what I have and keep everything together. This seems sturdy enough. The side pockets work great for storing instructions. Bare in mind I&#x27;m talking about electronics tools, not heavy auto tools.&lt;br /&gt;High quality very clear bag.</li>
            <li> I had to go on a business trip and pack all my shampoos and lotions, this was a perfect size.  The only thing i didn&#x27;t like is that the zipper is a bit flimsy, but you get what you pay for, it still works.</li>
            <li> i got this item for my dad he didnt like it.  i kept it and using it very convenient to use.</li>
            <li> Perfect you can see everything at a glance.</li>
            <li> Very cheap quality.  The zipper was broken and a seam was ripped, right out of the box.  I returned it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item, because I wanted to keep all my toiletries in one place where I could see everything that I have in the bag. I was traveling and this item was perfect. I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Top quality...plus it saves you from digging around to find something....trust me....you can see it in this bag for sure.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 9 year old son, who has Asperger&#x27;s and ADHD.  He&#x27;s very visual and is an &amp;#34;out of sight, out of mind&amp;#34; person.  So if he can&#x27;t see where something is he will forget about it, or get really frustrated that he can&#x27;t find it.  This holds all his markers, colored pencils, sketch books, mini duct tapes, etc.  He can carry it around or to a friend&#x27;s house.  And it&#x27;s helping him put stuff back in the bag and stay organized (not his strong suit).  Quality is average and holding up fine.</li>
            <li> I bought it to line the inside of my leather bag.  I carry thermoses and food that have previously leaked.  So far it does the job.</li>
            <li> I work for a company that polices have changed about how to bring in personal belongings and this works great.</li>
            <li> Great for travel and crafts. I use mine all the time, and I just love it. Easy to see storage !</li>
            <li> I purchased these for preschool co-op group to store individual student items (crayons, markers, scissors, glue, paper, etc) so each child had their own identical bag for class.  They loved the bags BUT the zippers are cheap. The inside zippers came right off on the first zip :( for organizing what I need they are fine but I&#x27;d go with another bag in the future. Didn&#x27;t attempt an exchange or return.</li>
            <li> The vinyl is very flimsy and the stitching was loose. Very poor quality. Do not waste your money on this product. I thought about returning it, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend more money, and I certainly didn&#x27;t want the frustration of dealing with a company that would sell such inferior products in the first place.</li>
            <li> Great for travel...can see everything without having to fumble around for something.  Fits all those 3 ounce bottles that are now required by the TSA very nicely.  Zips all the way around, which makes access convenient.</li>
            <li> Great bag.I bought two. Seem to be sturdy.And the bags hold alot.So easy to see what is inside.And can be wiped clean.</li>
            <li> it only took two days  broken and sewing of the sides was not good...it didnt last long. quality was very poor.</li>
            <li> What was unclear to me before ordering this is the design. The black lines you see halfway down the sides are pockets, which I understood before I ordered. However, I assumed the side pockets were the full length of each side with the openings just placed halfway. This is not so, the side pockets are just the lower half of the &amp;#34;briefcase.&amp;#34; I guess if you need to put something bigger than the height of the side pocket, it just has to go into the middle, unsecured. I have a similarly sized makeup organizer by Con***ts that does have side pockets with opening zippers about halfway down but where the pockets are the full length of the case. With this bag, expect all your contents to be in the bottom half of the bag and no real usable storage space above the zippers halfway down. Not terrible, just not terribly useful. The vinyl is a decent thickness, I would not expect it to puncture or rip with  regular use. Zippers are not great, I had one come off almost immediately but I was able to get it back on the tracks with a little work. I would not order this again nor would I recommend for storing anything other than maybe paper and pencils. For everything else, there are better products out there. I just wish I had chosen the &amp;#34;City Lights Carry-All Make Up Bag, Large, Clear&amp;#34; from this seller as I think it would serve my purposes better.</li>
