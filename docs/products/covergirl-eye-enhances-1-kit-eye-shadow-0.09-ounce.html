            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>Refund was given...but a hassle to have to do and would have liked to have the eye shadow!</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>It goes on well, good pigment and staying power.</li>
            <li>The quality is also good. ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li>It is a beautiful shade in my favorite color.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun and looks great!</li>
            <li>and I was very satisfied with the outcome.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this color!</li>
            <li>I love the shimmer effect!</li>
            <li>I love the color of this pallet!</li>
            <li>Not what I wanted but maybe nice to match with another</li>
            <li>I am sure would be good.  </li>
            <li>but it really is a nice product.</li>
            <li>I love this color of eye shadow.</li>
            <li>Not one of Covergirl&#x27;s better products.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite color.</li>
            <li>The shadow stays on okay with primer, but isn&#x27;t the most long-lasting.  </li>
            <li>Love the color and love Covergirl Make-up.</li>
            <li>Great product; delivered fast</li>
            <li>I picked this up for cheap, so you can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and wears well unless you sweat then you would need to reapply.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t collect in the creases of your eyes.</li>
            <li>, real lilac one, which I try to find now the good old fashioned way in a drugstore :)</li>
            <li>Super pretty shade!!</li>
            <li>Not bad,</li>
            <li>and it arrived super fast!!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>This is a pretty lilac color, which I&#x27;d say is true to the picture.  </li>
            <li>Since I only paid 89 cents for it, it really wasn&#x27;t worth my time to return it but still kind of a bummer.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Good coverage and subtle, not harsh looking as all too many silvers are.</li>
            <li>: firstly, the product is fairly powdery, and has quite a bit of fallout when trying to apply -- and secondly, there&#x27;s a definite glitter effect which I didn&#x27;t expect.  </li>
            <li>The chunks of glitter are quite large and noticeable.  </li>
            <li>It is not too dark or light just right!</li>
            <li>I give this as a gift to my friend and she said that she like it so much.</li>
            <li>This is a nice everyday color.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying it.</li>
            <li>I used the applicator that came with the color but quickly switched to my regular brushes as it is just a little too small to get good coverage.  </li>
            <li>comes in a compact case with a clear lid and an applicator brush.</li>
            <li>However, mine arrived as a mushed up powder after being thrown in a much too big box and shipped to me.  </li>
            <li>Very nice, but then again you can&#x27;t go wrong with covergirl!</li>
            <li>I have two major gripes though</li>
            <li>I love the color, but when I opened the Amazon box and took the item out, the eye shadow inside was completely broken.</li>
            <li>or you can use it at night for a more dramatic look</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d look for a less glittery shadow unless you really like that look.</li>

            <li> The powder is so smashed that it actually has started coming out of the plastic compact. :(</li>

            <li> Beautiful color! Very bright! I love it! Fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> I love this color of eye shadow. It goes on smooth. I order this with a coupon thinking it was one and I ended up getting three. I highly recommend buying it.</li>
            <li> Very nice, but then again you can&#x27;t go wrong with covergirl! If this is your color it&#x27;s a must buy!</li>
            <li> I love this color! It&#x27;s fun and looks great! It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t collect in the creases of your eyes.</li>
            <li> I just got this eye shadow in the mail. I love the color, but when I opened the Amazon box and took the item out, the eye shadow inside was completely broken. The powder is so smashed that it actually has started coming out of the plastic compact. :(</li>
            <li> This is a nice everyday color. It works equally well with lighter daytime make up or you can use it at night for a more dramatic look</li>
            <li> Super pretty shade!! I love the shimmer effect!</li>
            <li> Though it&#x27;s not obvious online, this eye shadow has a lot of little silver specks of glitter in it. When I wear this, I have to layer a lot on to get the purple to show, and there&#x27;s a lot of glitter fallout on my cheeks and the rest of my face. Not one of Covergirl&#x27;s better products.</li>
            <li> This lilac is almost purple, it&#x27;s way darker than I expected. Not what I wanted but maybe nice to match with another, real lilac one, which I try to find now the good old fashioned way in a drugstore :)</li>
            <li> Great product and quality! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Good quality. What you&#x27;d expect from cover girl. It goes on well, good pigment and staying power. Not my favorite color. I picked this up for cheap, so you can&#x27;t ask for more than that. Amazon: I purchased this item myself, please do not delete my review.</li>
            <li> The item itself I am sure would be good.  However, mine arrived as a mushed up powder after being thrown in a much too big box and shipped to me.  Since I only paid 89 cents for it, it really wasn&#x27;t worth my time to return it but still kind of a bummer.</li>
            <li> I give this as a gift to my friend and she said that she like it so much. The quality is also good. ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li> Came damaged...eye shadow was all crumbly...case was intact, just the actual eye shadow was all broke up. Refund was given...but a hassle to have to do and would have liked to have the eye shadow!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and wears well unless you sweat then you would need to reapply. comes in a compact case with a clear lid and an applicator brush.</li>
