            <li> It arrived 2 weeks earlier than expected, and came with no scratches or cracks. Still not sure it it is real obsidian or not, but so worth it and it was bigger than a golf ball so thats a plus. They do not give tracking info though, but its so worth the price.</li>
            <li> Nice stone, has joined my collection of crystal spheres of many colors.</li>
            <li> Beautiful piece! Am ordering a second one. It came packed very well and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Wishing that it had been bigger. But it still looks good on my altar.</li>
            <li> I think its really cool! I&#x27;m going to but another one just for s***s and giggles</li>

            <li> It is a pretty sphere.  The packaging was less than desired.  It was smashed up by the time I got it.  Luckily, the stone was fine!</li>
            <li> Little smaller than I thought it&#x27;d be, but cool.</li>
            <li> I love this black obsidian ball! It did not come with a stand, but that&#x27;s not a problem. It&#x27;s great for absorbing negative energies, and scrying. I would definitely purchase this item again. Beautiful, flawless, and an attention grabber!</li>

            <li> Took weeks to arrive, but this sphere is very nice and grounding. You will need to purchase a stand for it, however, as none is included.</li>
            <li> Awesome looking specimen I am very pleased with this obsidian ball! Thinking of buying a second one to use both like Chinese therapy balls. This vendor shipped my product out immediately and I got my piece right away. Definitely recommend this vendor to anyone seeking crystal support.</li>
