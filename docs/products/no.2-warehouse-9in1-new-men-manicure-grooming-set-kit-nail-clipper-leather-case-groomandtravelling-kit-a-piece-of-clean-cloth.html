            <li> I searched for the perfect small manicure kit.This is it. Perfect!</li>
            <li> Bought for a gift, arrived quickly, and looks like it cost more than it did! I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars as I didn&#x27;t use the pieces since they are for someone else.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for our son in law and he was happy to receive such a collection of manly  manicure tools!</li>
            <li> Gave it as a gift, very good quality.  I was happy.</li>

            <li> Bought 2/2015 Today is 5/2017... worked fine for about a year and then the clippers went blunt. the case became unglued...I expect this type of product to last longer, but you get what u pay for.  I recommend get a better product even if it costs more.</li>
            <li> its a xmas gift and I know he will like it  this is very nice</li>
            <li> $15.  The case is not great.  But, all of tools are very nice.  Hard to believe at this price...</li>
            <li> nicely constructed and compact. I use it at least twice a week for nail up keep.  Helps with drawer staying more organized.  Would recommend.</li>
