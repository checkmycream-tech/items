    <ol>
            <li>the all in one formula is just perfect</li>
            <li>This stuff works great!</li>
            <li>Greatest acne product ever!  </li>
            <li>great</li>
            <li>I also found it very effective on blemishes.</li>
            <li>It was pleasant to put on and wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>it is effective though.</li>
            <li>When I read the instruction, I found it effect was very strong.</li>
            <li>I am now 36 and have been to so many dermatologists and on so many meds including two rounds of Accutane.  </li>
            <li>To my delight, it also happens to be the best acne product I have ever used: OTC or prescription, oral or topical.</li>
            <li>So if this is an issue for you, try this out for sure but check if you are allergic to any of the million ingredients before purchasing.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off buying a cheaper BP and an oil free lotion of some kind and mixing them together.  </li>
            <li>What more can I say?</li>
            <li>But after that I stopped using it, my skin become better than before.</li>
            <li>has stress sweat that many teenagers get along with their hormone flares.  </li>
            <li>She was able to start wearing shoulder-</li>
            <li>But super effective.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this to anyone who needs an effective spot treatment!</li>
            <li>Great product for soft glowing skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong and you can feel it working.</li>
            <li>Absolutely an amazing acne product clears up acne really fast and</li>
            <li>All-In-One has been very effective on those deep refilling pimples on the side of my chin.  </li>
            <li>If you are familiar with the faces of animal testing you understand.</li>
            <li>My skin gets better each and everyday with this lotion and the best part is that it works FAST.</li>
            <li>After spending countless of dollars on Amazon purchasing acne products, this product has been my best purchase thus far.</li>
            <li>The product is still lasting and is most cost effective.  </li>
            <li>Nothing has ever worked that quickly for me.  </li>
            <li>product is a miracle and would recommend it most highly.  </li>
            <li>Although this is only 5% benzoyl peroxide, I found this product to be very, very strong for my face.  </li>
            <li>Just a great product &amp; experience overall, &amp; from a company with a moral compass.</li>
            <li>Overall very satisfied with the results and looking forward to my face being completely clear.</li>
            <li>At first this wouldn&#x27;t dispense at all.  </li>
            <li>I love that this stuff was made by a doctor and not a big corporation.  </li>
            <li>, my face has never looked better and I am hoping that a few more weeks of treatment my face will be completely clear!</li>
            <li>Within a week saw many less pimples and most were drying out so only needed to use on a couple spot areas.  </li>
            <li>I stumbled upon it while looking for cruelty free creams &amp; it is the very sort of item that gives me hope for the future.</li>
            <li>Something that really works.  </li>
            <li>so many other products caused with the aloe being soothing.  </li>
            <li>far as the product goes, it does work fast, but</li>
            <li>But, after working and working at it like a piston, it finally started dispensing, and it spread O.K. and absorbed</li>
            <li>A few products have slightly helped, but so far this Augustus All in One has been the best over all prescription oral and topical meds, and OTC products.  </li>
            <li>The product itself is amazing, BUT this is the second one I&#x27;ve bought that quits pumping after a few uses.</li>
            <li>Only gave 3 stars because the product really doesn&#x27;t do much for my pimples.</li>
            <li>This cream quickly cleared up a deep, deep zit that appeared out of nowhere on my chin and wouldn&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of other products, but this is the first one that delivered real results.</li>
            <li>As far as the cons, it does burn and will cause peeling</li>
            <li>We will never waste our money on another product.</li>
            <li>Stopping a blemish in its tracks is exactly how you avoid being left with red marks and/or scars that have to be lasered away</li>
            <li>We both now use it on spot facial acne and would have no reservations using it on my face if I had even more serious acne.  </li>
            <li>I use it for spot treatments &amp; depending on the size &amp; stubbornness of the pimple, it either stops it in its tracks &amp; nearly vanishes overnight, or it dramatically speeds up the process &amp; you will have a whitehead the following morning.</li>
            <li>It has helped to clear up both the black heads on my nose, large cystic acne on my cheeks and whiteheads on my forehead.  </li>

            <li> It also appears to be fading the marks left behind from past pimples.</li>
            <li> would buy it again for that single annoying zit on my face which I want gone NOW, but not to use an overall facial preventative treatment.  </li>
            <li> no more toner/ face wash/ moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have had horrible acne since I was about 11 years old.  </li>

            <li> but after two days, it dries the skin terribly.  </li>
            <li> Smells terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The product itself is amazing, BUT this is the second one I&#x27;ve bought that quits pumping after a few uses. I had to have my husband saw the bottle apart to get the cream out, then I stored it in another container. If they don&#x27;t change/improve the packaging, I won&#x27;t buy again! Unfortunate, because the cream works so well, but for the price I expect to be able to get it out of the container.</li>
            <li> Although this is only 5% benzoyl peroxide, I found this product to be very, very strong for my face.  The texture is gritty and if you exfoliate your skin, you will feel irritation when you put this product on.  i couldn&#x27;t use it on my face.  i do however use it on my chest and shoulders when i get break outs there.  it is effective though.</li>
            <li> great..love all ingredients combined..</li>
            <li> I am placing a reorder on this product now.  I have had horrible acne since I was about 11 years old.  I am now 36 and have been to so many dermatologists and on so many meds including two rounds of Accutane.  A few products have slightly helped, but so far this Augustus All in One has been the best over all prescription oral and topical meds, and OTC products.  It has helped to clear up both the black heads on my nose, large cystic acne on my cheeks and whiteheads on my forehead.  My skin has still been oily, so I have recently added Pantothenic Acid (vitamin B-5) which I have read helps control oil output and people with very oil skin are deficient in this vitamin.  I also purchased this from Amazon:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000NZDN2Y Acid Pantothenic 1000mg Timed Release]]&lt;br /&gt;Between these two products, my face has never looked better and I am hoping that a few more weeks of treatment my face will be completely clear!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I stumbled upon it while looking for cruelty free creams &amp; it is the very sort of item that gives me hope for the future. If you are familiar with the faces of animal testing you understand. To my delight, it also happens to be the best acne product I have ever used: OTC or prescription, oral or topical. I use it for spot treatments &amp; depending on the size &amp; stubbornness of the pimple, it either stops it in its tracks &amp; nearly vanishes overnight, or it dramatically speeds up the process &amp; you will have a whitehead the following morning. Gross, yes. But super effective. Stopping a blemish in its tracks is exactly how you avoid being left with red marks and/or scars that have to be lasered away later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several months I began having trouble with the pump (which has since been changed) &amp; after a brief email, a replacement is in the mail. Just a great product &amp; experience overall, &amp; from a company with a moral compass. Know your brands. http://features.peta.org/cruelty-free-company-search/index.aspx</li>
            <li> Absolutely an amazing acne product clears up acne really fast and the all in one formula is just perfect no more toner/ face wash/ moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This cream quickly cleared up a deep, deep zit that appeared out of nowhere on my chin and wouldn&#x27;t go away. It&#x27;s strong and you can feel it working. Highly recommend this to anyone who needs an effective spot treatment!</li>
            <li> Something that really works.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of other products, but this is the first one that delivered real results.</li>
            <li> After spending countless of dollars on Amazon purchasing acne products, this product has been my best purchase thus far. My skin gets better each and everyday with this lotion and the best part is that it works FAST. In a matter of four days my skin is almost completely clear from acne and dark spots. As far as the cons, it does burn and will cause peeling but that is to be expected due to the benzoyl peroxide. Overall very satisfied with the results and looking forward to my face being completely clear.</li>
            <li> BUT ITS HORRIBLE FOR YOUR JEWELRY! This is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.  Do not use any jewelry (AT ALL) when you have this cream on.  I didn&#x27;t realize it would transfer from my skin and tarnish all my silver jewelry...the later became dark gray and lost its shine for good.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the product goes, it does work fast, but careful when you use it on your face. It works well but after two days, it dries the skin terribly.  After suspending use for a while (2-3 days) and using a lot of facial moisturizer, the skin stopped flaking off.  Also do not use on a pimple that has already been squeezed or where the skin is broken.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again for that single annoying zit on my face which I want gone NOW, but not to use an overall facial preventative treatment.  However, I would continue to buy this product to treat and avoid the appearance of pimples and acne on my back (I don&#x27;t mind the dryness occurring there).  So if this is an issue for you, try this out for sure but check if you are allergic to any of the million ingredients before purchasing.</li>
            <li> At first this wouldn&#x27;t dispense at all.  I almost returned it.  I should have!  But, after working and working at it like a piston, it finally started dispensing, and it spread O.K. and absorbed O.K.  But, It&#x27;s not dispensing again.  There&#x27;s gobs left in there, it&#x27;s long past when I can return it, and it cost a fortune.  You&#x27;re better off buying a cheaper BP and an oil free lotion of some kind and mixing them together.  Truly.  This is going in the trash.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great! I saw a pimple pop up one evening, used this on it that night and the next morning and it was gone. Nothing has ever worked that quickly for me.  You need to dab it on, do not smear all over your face like you have to for other products.  This product works better than any of those that the dermatologist prescribed, and less expensive.</li>
            <li> Smells terrible. Does nothing.</li>
            <li> All-In-One has been very effective on those deep refilling pimples on the side of my chin.  It also appears to be fading the marks left behind from past pimples.</li>
            <li> I love that this stuff was made by a doctor and not a big corporation.  It doesn&#x27;t require 10 steps that I don&#x27;t have time for.  And it works.  What more can I say?</li>
            <li> To my surprise, dark spots faded within one week of nightly use. I also found it very effective on blemishes.</li>
            <li> I used it only two days. My skin started to become very dry and peel. When I read the instruction, I found it effect was very strong. But after that I stopped using it, my skin become better than before.</li>
            <li> Quite simply, smells like a chemical solvent, and burns my skin.  Not worth the price.  Back to my trusty Neutrogena retinol products.</li>
            <li> Greatest acne product ever!  I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s shoulder and back acne.  She is an equestrian and not only sweats but has stress sweat that many teenagers get along with their hormone flares.  Within a couple days the inflammation and redness was reduced with a lot less discomfort.  Within a week saw many less pimples and most were drying out so only needed to use on a couple spot areas.  She was able to start wearing shoulder- and back-showing tops without embarrassment.  She had little dryness and irritation so many other products caused with the aloe being soothing.  It was pleasant to put on and wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a miracle and would recommend it most highly.  We both now use it on spot facial acne and would have no reservations using it on my face if I had even more serious acne.  The product is still lasting and is most cost effective.  We will never waste our money on another product.</li>
            <li> Great product for soft glowing skin.  Only gave 3 stars because the product really doesn&#x27;t do much for my pimples.</li>
