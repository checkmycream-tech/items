            <li> I wash my hair every day and it lasts a long time as a detangler.</li>
            <li> I could feel where the spray was and my hair felt weighted down and dirty, no matter how many times I brushed and combed my hair out.</li>
            <li> My hair is still dry.</li>
            <li> Have only used it once since I got it, but didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling heavy after use.  </li>
            <li> I think the people who mentioned that it was heavy or greasy actually sprayed it on their hair.</li>
            <li> , woks well with other Malibu products</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li> Is a little expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Especially when used in conjunction with the hard water shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy or weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Here is how I use it: I wash and condition my hair as usual with Malibu C shampoo and conditioner, towel dry my hair and then put about 3 to 4 sprays of Leave-In Conditioner Mist into my hand, rub my hands together and then work through my hair.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price is about half of retail and I have stocked up on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update Feb. 2016</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use this my hair is a tangled mess to try and comb before drying it.  </li>
            <li> Then I style as usual.</li>
            <li> I used it with the Water Well System Kit (Hard Water Wellness).</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t help with softness, manageability or hard water build up.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help my hair, our water is very hard but this had no affect on the texture of my hair</li>
            <li> I may work for others but no good for my hair!</li>
            <li> Useless product.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t disappointed and will continue to use it.</li>

            <li> I think this is a must have product to use when you are in chlorine and sun throughout the summer.</li>
            <li> I use this every time I am heading to the pool. It does not leave your hair greasy. It also smells great.</li>

            <li> not convinced it is helping but smells good and the price is good</li>
            <li> This is a must have if you have well water! It makes your hair feel great!</li>
            <li> This helped me a lot after the swim shampoo and conditioner.  It is awesome to find a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t help with softness, manageability or hard water build up.  Useless product.  The shampoo and conditioner are good though, stick with those.</li>
            <li> IT leaves my hair feeling soft and tangle free and smelling great! wonderul, awesome , marvelous, why does this review make you write so many words?</li>

            <li> I love the well water shampoo and conditioner but this leave in conditioner makes my hair frizzy for some reason. I have naturally curly hair and wear it curly. I may work for others but no good for my hair!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It makes combing out my hair a breeze. I do not have to use styling products on my hair when I use it. I recommend this product to everyone that has well water!!!</li>
            <li> I guess it works ok. My hair is still dry. But I think it&#x27;s helping keep the well water damage at bay.</li>
            <li> lock in moisture...cant go without it</li>
            <li> Have only used it once since I got it, but didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling heavy after use.  Is a little expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> hard to really tell, need to use it longer, but so far so good</li>
            <li> Smells great and works wonders</li>
            <li> I cannot live without Malibu C leave in conditioner mist.  I use it every day after pulling the towel off my hair, I mist it with this before I comb it out.  If I don&#x27;t use this my hair is a tangled mess to try and comb before drying it.  My hair is thin and fine, so I like the Malibu C because it doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy.</li>
            <li> My stylist told me about this product, and I thought I would try it.... never again. While the scent is nice- it left my hair greasy and oily. I could feel where the spray was and my hair felt weighted down and dirty, no matter how many times I brushed and combed my hair out.</li>
            <li> This review is for: Malibu C Leave-in Conditioner Mist 8oz (Misc.)&lt;br /&gt;I really like this spray as an a little &amp;quot;extra conditioner&amp;quot; and detangler for my hair. Here is how I use it: I wash and condition my hair as usual with Malibu C shampoo and conditioner, towel dry my hair and then put about 3 to 4 sprays of Leave-In Conditioner Mist into my hand, rub my hands together and then work through my hair. I think the people who mentioned that it was heavy or greasy actually sprayed it on their hair. A little goes a very long way.  It makes my hair smoother and easy to come through and does not weigh it down. I have mid-length hair, a lot of it, but it is very fine and can get sometimes hard to comb through after washing. Then I style as usual. I wash my hair every day and it lasts a long time as a detangler. Amazon&#x27;s price is about half of retail and I have stocked up on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update Feb. 2016: It is about 4 years since I ordered this conditioning mist and I am still using it. Although I have tried a number of new hair products I have found none that take the place of this spray.</li>
            <li> love it makes your hair soft and manageable!!!!</li>
            <li> When paired with the shampoo and conditioner, my hair feels soft and looks beautiful!  I can get that fresh-from-the-hair-dresser look on my own!&lt;br /&gt;I swim daily and play waterpolo a couple times a week, so my hair takes quite a beating, but this hair-care line is very effective in keeping my hair healthy.  Last time I got my hair cut, the hair dresser kept commenting on how soft and healthy my hair was....this was definitely a first!</li>
            <li> Great product and great transaction. Love the scent and the moisturization of the leave in. Not all leave-ins are the same and this one is a keeper.</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely great!  I definitely recommend this product.  Especially when used in conjunction with the hard water shampoo and conditioner.</li>
