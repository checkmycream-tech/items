            <li>The thickening shampoo is awesome but don&#x27;t buy the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I cannot believe something so wonderful just changed overnight into sticky glue like waxy goop.</li>

            <li>it looks great, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems that with months of use, this product is GREAT for clearing up any residue on my scalp, BUT it is drying out my hair.  </li>

            <li>:o)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any good using it.</li>
            <li>I loved this shampoo and conditioner while it was working.</li>
            <li>think it will good for my hair.</li>
            <li>Bought to go with the shampoo, nothing has ever worked and smelled so good as this.  </li>
            <li>It has a good texture and consistency and does moisturize and make the hair feel stronger.  </li>
            <li>Good product but</li>
            <li>It is a good product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Good thickening shampoo</li>
            <li>and I had tried every good shampoo in the market until I used Biotin.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Smells good too.</li>
            <li>best conditioner ever- better than most shampoos and conditioners (salon brand included) out there in the market.</li>
            <li>It is very refreshing and no wait time for the conditioner to work.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel very healthy.  </li>
            <li>Nice, smells good.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>It makes me feel better that it&#x27;s organic as well!</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s organic too!</li>
            <li>This conditioner does magic!</li>
            <li>Smell is pleasant as well :)</li>
            <li>i buy champoo too and is amazing.</li>
            <li>Through experience, a shampoo is most effective when it can build up a good lather and foam up nicely.</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t like this product.  </li>
            <li>After drying, my hair looked kind of greasy/oily.</li>
            <li>For it to be effective, I have to mix it with another conditioner.</li>
            <li>They were nice about the return though.</li>
            <li>This is an extremely effective break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I honestly wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li>Avalon conditioner I liked in the stores</li>
            <li>It is wonderful and really has made a noticeable difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li>This is the best so far.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s more effective for hair</li>
            <li>I have very, very fine hair.</li>
            <li>Although my hair is very fine, so perhaps ethnic girls, and women with coarser hair might benefit?</li>
            <li>It makes my hair look greasy (but I have very fine hair).</li>
            <li>They use incredible ingredients that greatly benefit people with hair loss due to hormonal issues, or who have an increase in DHT.</li>
            <li>our hair with that squeaky clean feeling, but not in a good way, more in a removed all the oil from your hair</li>
            <li>It does not glide on to hair very smoothly and smells like Pine Sol.</li>
            <li>Excellent customer service and super fast S&amp;H</li>
            <li>Good quality, it is worth to repurchase</li>
            <li>It makes my hair look fuller and shiny :-)</li>
            <li>Love the aveda-ish ajurvedic smell.</li>
            <li>And I love the minty/herbal smell.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s organic, but just didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it and I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;m pulling even more hair out while rinsing this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love their shampoo</li>
            <li>Just love this Biotin B-complex thickening conditioner.  </li>
            <li>When doing your shampoo becomes a favorite part of your day, you can bet you are using this stuff.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner is okay.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I love the way this makes my hair feel.  </li>
            <li>Love the shampoo</li>
            <li>I have been using Avalon Thickening Conditioner for about 2 years now, and I&#x27;m pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>the best shampoo going for the hair that has turned from silver to white.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>It really did thickening my hair, and made it smell great..</li>
            <li>You have to be in shape if you&#x27;re bald :)</li>
            <li>I pulled more hair out trying to work this stuff through my hair.</li>
            <li>I love that it is organic.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>They use many products that have an oil stripping effect on the hair, like orange oil and lemon oil.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair now</li>
            <li>and I feel so much more confident.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now quite confident in what I&#x27;m using and plan to go on using it, regardless of the cost.</li>
            <li>By helping to combat it twice a day, you have a better chance of seeing results sooner.</li>

            <li>I love the thickening shampoo.  </li>
            <li>In fact I feel like the conditioner dries out my hair even more after washing.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes a touch of hairspray but most days, not.</li>
            <li>My Dr. was pleased w/the ingredients of the shamp, cond AND supplements.</li>
            <li>A girl can dream. :)</li>
            <li>A girl can dream. :)</li>
            <li>I love the scent</li>
            <li>I love my hair after I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li>It styles much better than before using it.</li>
            <li>Feels like more hair.</li>
            <li>I love it and my hair does not get &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; to it after a while.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft, styles well, no frizz, and feels so good!</li>
            <li>is a great product , leave my hair clean and whit much vitamint, i love it.</li>
            <li>The good is that my hairs feels soft and silky and smells nice.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t know if it makes my hair thicker or healthier, but it feels good and thought it was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a good conditioner, it just doesn&#x27;t do much to thicken my hair.</li>
            <li>do find though that the thicker conditioners don&#x27;t flow easily from the bottle.</li>
            <li>I got this shampoo to help build up and give vitamins to my fine hair.</li>
            <li>The price is usually pretty excellent on Amazon compared to my local health store.</li>
            <li>Great organic product, works pretty much as described.</li>
            <li>use with the same shampoo, great products if you want a full head of hair, and helps growth too!</li>
            <li>I ended up buy Rogaine and that has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I have seen a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Great body when enhanced by the conditioner same brand.  </li>
            <li>I use a different conditioner, but still use the shampoo because it is great.</li>
            <li>The smell is not flowery &amp; fun, but it&#x27;s more medicinal in scent, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Feel free to ask me</li>
            <li>/&gt;**IT&#x27;S IMPORTANT TO MENTION THAT ALONG W/</li>
            <li>/&gt;9/21/13 - IMPORTANT UPDATE.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;9/21/13 - IMPORTANT UPDATE.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to note that I&#x27;m 42 years old, w/disturbing hair</li>
            <li>Thicker, fuller, shinier, healthier hair thanks to this product!!!</li>
            <li>Leaves hair feeling light and clean, removes buildup from styling products.</li>
            <li>I was about to purchase another bottle of this for someone else and noticed the price has more than doubled since I first purchased it a month or two ago.  </li>
            <li>When used together the signs of balding are significantly reduced (seeing your scalp through the hair).</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get this conditioner</li>
            <li>I should also note that my nails need to be trimmed more often than ever, and I have to shave, (legs, underarms), more frequently!  </li>
            <li>I should also note that my nails need to be trimmed more often than ever, and I have to shave, (legs, underarms), more frequently!  </li>
            <li>It has a nice natural smell that all of us enjoy.</li>
            <li>My hair felt like it wasn&#x27;t clean.  </li>
            <li>My hair always feels clean, fuller and I have gained length since using this product</li>
            <li>Good price for a 14 oz product that I would have paid way more from a hair supply or some other store.</li>
            <li>I feel good knowing the ingredients are better for my health than conventional shampoos.</li>
            <li>It takes 2 full tablespoons to get that result with this product.</li>
            <li>I had to use twice as much just to be able to comb my hair -and</li>
            <li>Different packaging would be a good idea.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really feel like its cleaning my hair, more like its drying it out.</li>
            <li>My four stars is based solely on the fact that it&#x27;s a good conditioner and not that it created extra thickness.</li>
            <li>and then I feel like maybe I need to put more in (which I refuse to do because then I&#x27;ll run out too fast).</li>
            <li>, I love it so much.</li>
            <li>I suspect this would be from the internal good</li>
            <li>I suspect this would be from the internal good</li>
            <li>My hair is much thicker and has more body and volume.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner, it makes my hair feel very soft.</li>
            <li>(SO much better!), coconut oil, argan oil, jojoba, and the occasional egg</li>
            <li>Not only does this conditioner keep my hair full, soft, and shiny all day, but is also great to use.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying some more when I&#x27;m out of this one!</li>
            <li>My nails, which I keep short, need to be cut once every week to 10 days as opposed to once every 3 or more weeks!  </li>
            <li>My nails, which I keep short, need to be cut once every week to 10 days as opposed to once every 3 or more weeks!  </li>
            <li>Fresh.  </li>
            <li>You do pay more than double for that shampoo, but having something that supports your hair, improves the texture, and smells fantastic, was worth it to me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I chanced upon this product because my hair fall has reduced considerably and the quality is also improving.</li>
            <li>And its a very good value for the size however, it doesn&#x27;t seem to make my hair as soft as some other products.</li>
            <li>I have older fine hair and the shampoo</li>
            <li>When first using the conditioner it may seem as if you need to use more than normal, but give it some work first.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that I noticed any difference  with thickening between this conditioner and any other that I used, but it&#x27;s a good conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Being a long haired guy, I&#x27;ve developed a preference for the more natural shampoos and conditioners, but really wasn&#x27;t happy with this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, but NOT worth $20</li>
            <li>The conditioner is foamy and goes a long way, feels nice</li>
            <li>but it seems kind of dry</li>
            <li>This happened a couple of years ago, but I see they still haven&#x27;t changed the formula back to the good old one, so I thought I should warn others about this \\&quot;conditioner\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Although I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice a change in volume and texture, ..I will continue to buy both products because I like the natural ingredients and wonderful scent.</li>
            <li>but you don&#x27;t have to use very much.</li>
            <li>It worked fine for me, but if you&#x27;re looking for something truly all natural</li>
            <li>i bought it for my little sister ,she said it&#x27;s good for her hair about her hair lose</li>
            <li>However, it dries my hair out (even when used with the conditioner) and leaves my scalp pretty itchy.</li>
            <li>I have average-to-dry curly hair, that I like to let air-dry in order to enjoy its natural curl.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried it several times just to make sure that it&#x27;s not a case of my hair needing to adjust.</li>
            <li>In the last year or so I&#x27;ve noticed that I am losing a lot more hair than I would like or would like to admit.</li>
            <li>Rather than leaving my hair softer and more manageable (which is a conditioner&#x27;s most basic function), this conditioner left a noticeable, waxy residue in my hair.</li>
            <li>It definitely makes your hair thicker, but make sure you get it rinsed out thoroughly or hair will look greasy.  </li>
            <li>I actually think it made my hair tangle more.  </li>
            <li>This smelled pretty herbal for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for several years now, and am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>6/8/2013, first review</li>
            <li>it might not be a good everyday use.</li>
            <li>Better than many other natural shampoos.</li>
            <li>Left my hair feeling very clean.</li>
            <li>If I had thick hair, I&#x27;d probably love this :-)</li>
            <li>I have used many different organic types of shampoo/conditioner and never have had to use this much.  </li>
            <li>All the reviews were so positive here</li>
            <li>I like this pretty much</li>
            <li>I get more for less money and the shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it long to review this product but my hair definitely feels good.</li>
            <li>Have been using Avalon for a few years and still love it!</li>
            <li>noticed the difference after first use, highly recommended</li>
            <li>works really well</li>
            <li>It became much cheaper just after my order.</li>
            <li>So much so that I had to cut 4 inches off.</li>
            <li>and I was really hopeful.</li>
            <li>This conditioner does not make my hair smooth enough to get my tangle out.  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t really tell if it does anything for my hair.  </li>
            <li>It really helps the hair to look fuller and to grow.</li>
            <li>I got this organic conditioner to use with the Pura d&#x27;or shampoo and the combination really works.  </li>
            <li>Hehe ,but I  think the transportation expenses is too much</li>
            <li>I had to use a lot to get my whole hair with the product and did not care for the feeling of my hair after rinsing</li>
            <li>The appearance of thickness is all I really care about.</li>
            <li>I really like the Avalon Organics Thickening Shampoo.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very drying.</li>
            <li>but I really look forward to how this product will help me grow out my hair</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really seen any results either.</li>
            <li>Very dissappointed</li>
            <li>I rub it gently on my scalp &amp; throughout my hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel like it cleans or softens real well</li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels much stronger.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is kind of heavy</li>
            <li>The Shampoo is harsh but effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a cream that I rub gently onto wet hair.</li>
            <li>I am not certain if I love this corresponding conditioner, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have long color treated hair and when using this product I find my hair is easy to manage after shampooing, no tangles.</li>
            <li>I share this conditioner with two other housemates and we LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Shampoo was ok but after using the conditioner I needed to use my detangler or use my other conditioners.</li>
            <li>I rcvd two complements on my hair this past week, about how shiny &amp;healthy it looks!  </li>
            <li>I rcvd two complements on my hair this past week, about how shiny &amp;healthy it looks!  </li>
            <li>Use what you would normally use, and gently work it around the ends of your hair, really rubbing it all around, then move your way up, you should have plenty.  </li>
            <li>I have medium long, fine hair.</li>
            <li>, I have fine hair and it made my hair feel thick and strong.</li>
            <li>The morning after using it, my hair is pretty oily, but really soft.</li>
            <li>wow just noticed for the first time I HAVE NO FRIZZ.</li>
            <li>I have to use a trememdously large amount in order to get any type of actual conditioning feeling in my hair with this...literally 1/4-1/3 of a cup worth.</li>
            <li>I can say for sure that the stimulating scalp part does work because I can feel a slight tingling in my scalp just after I use it.</li>
            <li>I see less hair in the comb and more on my head.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Had high hopes for it, and it did not deliver.&lt;br</li>
            <li>mostly pleased by the ingredients for a natural way to thicken hair growth without using the toxic ingredients in other brands at the grocery store.</li>

            <li>Then let it sit for a few minutes before rinsing (I shampoo my hair first thing, put the conditioner in, then wash my face and body, shave, then rinse the conditioner out lightly).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather see people get something that will improve their self-esteem immediately, rather than give them new problems to worry about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hope is that this is the case for my scalp &amp; maybe, just maybe, I&#x27;ll see some new sprouts.</li>

            <li>I gave it many tries and it had the same effect.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There isn&#x27;t a strong scent to this conditioner, but it does have a slight earthy or bark-like aromatic smell as you&#x27;re applying it.</li>
            <li>When I first started using this back in February 2013, my thinning hair stopped shedding completely!</li>
            <li>My hair is much more thicker and fuller than any products I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>but I bought several bottles since my first purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It takes to curling quickly and has natural waves if I let it air dry.</li>
            <li>This left my hair feeling VERY greasy after only one day, which is pretty unacceptable.  </li>
            <li>Other conditioners are slimy and just rinse right out of my hair, but this one is absorbed and does the trick all day long.</li>
            <li>My curls are always soft and poppin after each&lt;br /&gt;use.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try something natural.</li>
            <li>I preferred the results from the old formula.</li>
            <li>So far after about 6 uses, my hair is thicker and fuller.</li>
            <li>It is cheaper and make your hair soft and weightless as well.</li>
            <li>However, I do really like the Biotin B-Complex shampoo by the same brand and would recommend that product.</li>
            <li>Did not make my hair feel soft or moisturized.  </li>
            <li>So far does not seem to &amp;#34;thicken&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>no frizz, natural curls (when did I have curls??)  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product that I have been using for a few years.</li>
            <li>This is because one application of shampoo with DHT-fighting ingredients, can only do so much.</li>

            <li>I purchased the shampoo and conditioner for my 80 year old mother.</li>
            <li>its short so there should be no reason i should have to use this much conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I have thin curly hair that has a mind of its own</li>
            <li>Nice thick conditioner makes your hair feel really smooth and thick.</li>
            <li>it really make your hair thick, and leaves soft and clean.</li>

            <li>A 32 year old male and recently grew my hair out for the first time since my teens.</li>
            <li>The shampoo lathers if you work at it, &amp; it&#x27;s a low lather rather than a high and luffy one.</li>
            <li>Mine is fine, thin, and straight.</li>
            <li>I must say that THIS IS NOT the same formulation (in my opinion) as past formulations I&#x27;ve used were FAR MORE conditioning and a completely different texture.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner not only seems watered down but it really doesnt do much for my hair either.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this conditioner to anyone especially if your&lt;br /&gt;a natural girl.</li>
            <li>The conditioner has a quite an extensive list of natural oils and ingredients.</li>
            <li>Did not make hair soft or feel thicker just left tangled.</li>
            <li>It barely did anything for my hair.  </li>
            <li>the price is not bad, since it takes a few drops to do the job, even with long hair.</li>
            <li>My hair was a sticky, tangly mess, like I had put glue in my hair and really rubbed it in.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine like a baby&#x27;s and rather thin.  </li>
            <li>When I opened the first one and squeezed a little conditioner onto my hand, I thought, oh no, this is not conditioner!</li>
            <li>When I first opened the conditioner, it was really a really thick and creamy appearance, but the second I put it in my hair, it lost all of its integrity and seemingly barely covered my hair!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so hard to find shampoo and conditioner that are natural and sulphate free/safe for colored hair for a reasonable price.</li>

            <li> I have been using this for quite sometime now and am very happy for this product.</li>
            <li> The thickening shampoo is awesome but don&#x27;t buy the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I cannot believe something so wonderful just changed overnight into sticky glue like waxy goop.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner on the market even if you do not have thinning and damaged hair like I do.</li>
            <li> best price on the internet</li>

            <li> it looks great, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems that with months of use, this product is GREAT for clearing up any residue on my scalp, BUT it is drying out my hair.  </li>

            <li> Amazing conditioner!</li>
            <li> :o)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any good using it.</li>
            <li> I loved this shampoo and conditioner while it was working.</li>
            <li> think it will good for my hair.</li>
            <li> Bought to go with the shampoo, nothing has ever worked and smelled so good as this.  </li>
            <li> It has a good texture and consistency and does moisturize and make the hair feel stronger.  </li>
            <li> Good product but</li>
            <li> It is a good product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Good thickening shampoo</li>
            <li> and I had tried every good shampoo in the market until I used Biotin.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Smells good too.</li>
            <li> best conditioner ever- better than most shampoos and conditioners (salon brand included) out there in the market.</li>
            <li> It is very refreshing and no wait time for the conditioner to work.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel very healthy.  </li>
            <li> Nice, smells good.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> It makes me feel better that it&#x27;s organic as well!</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s organic too!</li>
            <li> This conditioner does magic!</li>
            <li> Smell is pleasant as well :)</li>
            <li> i buy champoo too and is amazing.</li>
            <li> Through experience, a shampoo is most effective when it can build up a good lather and foam up nicely.</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t like this product.  </li>
            <li> After drying, my hair looked kind of greasy/oily.</li>
            <li> For it to be effective, I have to mix it with another conditioner.</li>
            <li> They were nice about the return though.</li>
            <li> This is an extremely effective break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I honestly wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Avalon conditioner I liked in the stores</li>
            <li> It is wonderful and really has made a noticeable difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li> This is the best so far.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s more effective for hair</li>
            <li> I have very, very fine hair.</li>
            <li> Although my hair is very fine, so perhaps ethnic girls, and women with coarser hair might benefit?</li>
            <li> It makes my hair look greasy (but I have very fine hair).</li>
            <li> They use incredible ingredients that greatly benefit people with hair loss due to hormonal issues, or who have an increase in DHT.</li>
            <li> our hair with that squeaky clean feeling, but not in a good way, more in a removed all the oil from your hair</li>
            <li> It does not glide on to hair very smoothly and smells like Pine Sol.</li>
            <li> Excellent customer service and super fast S&amp;H</li>
            <li> Good quality, it is worth to repurchase</li>
            <li> It makes my hair look fuller and shiny :-)</li>
            <li> Love the aveda-ish ajurvedic smell.</li>
            <li> And I love the minty/herbal smell.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s organic, but just didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it and I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;m pulling even more hair out while rinsing this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love their shampoo</li>
            <li> Just love this Biotin B-complex thickening conditioner.  </li>
            <li> When doing your shampoo becomes a favorite part of your day, you can bet you are using this stuff.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner is okay.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my hair feel.  </li>
            <li> Love the shampoo</li>
            <li> I have been using Avalon Thickening Conditioner for about 2 years now, and I&#x27;m pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> the best shampoo going for the hair that has turned from silver to white.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> It really did thickening my hair, and made it smell great..</li>
            <li> You have to be in shape if you&#x27;re bald :)</li>
            <li> I pulled more hair out trying to work this stuff through my hair.</li>
            <li> I love that it is organic.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> They use many products that have an oil stripping effect on the hair, like orange oil and lemon oil.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair now</li>
            <li> and I feel so much more confident.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now quite confident in what I&#x27;m using and plan to go on using it, regardless of the cost.</li>
            <li> By helping to combat it twice a day, you have a better chance of seeing results sooner.</li>

            <li> I love the thickening shampoo.  </li>
            <li> In fact I feel like the conditioner dries out my hair even more after washing.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes a touch of hairspray but most days, not.</li>
            <li> My Dr. was pleased w/the ingredients of the shamp, cond AND supplements.</li>

            <li> I love the scent</li>
            <li> I love my hair after I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> It styles much better than before using it.</li>
            <li> Feels like more hair.</li>
            <li> I love it and my hair does not get &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; to it after a while.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft, styles well, no frizz, and feels so good!</li>
            <li> is a great product , leave my hair clean and whit much vitamint, i love it.</li>
            <li> The good is that my hairs feels soft and silky and smells nice.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know if it makes my hair thicker or healthier, but it feels good and thought it was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a good conditioner, it just doesn&#x27;t do much to thicken my hair.</li>
            <li> do find though that the thicker conditioners don&#x27;t flow easily from the bottle.</li>
            <li> I got this shampoo to help build up and give vitamins to my fine hair.</li>
            <li> The price is usually pretty excellent on Amazon compared to my local health store.</li>
            <li> Great organic product, works pretty much as described.</li>
            <li> use with the same shampoo, great products if you want a full head of hair, and helps growth too!</li>
            <li> I ended up buy Rogaine and that has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I have seen a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Great body when enhanced by the conditioner same brand.  </li>
            <li> I use a different conditioner, but still use the shampoo because it is great.</li>
            <li> The smell is not flowery &amp; fun, but it&#x27;s more medicinal in scent, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Feel free to ask me</li>
            <li> /&gt;**IT&#x27;S IMPORTANT TO MENTION THAT ALONG W/</li>
            <li> /&gt;9/21/13 - IMPORTANT UPDATE.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;9/21/13 - IMPORTANT UPDATE.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to note that I&#x27;m 42 years old, w/disturbing hair</li>
            <li> Thicker, fuller, shinier, healthier hair thanks to this product!!!</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling light and clean, removes buildup from styling products.</li>
            <li> I was about to purchase another bottle of this for someone else and noticed the price has more than doubled since I first purchased it a month or two ago.  </li>
            <li> When used together the signs of balding are significantly reduced (seeing your scalp through the hair).</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this conditioner</li>
            <li> I should also note that my nails need to be trimmed more often than ever, and I have to shave, (legs, underarms), more frequently!  </li>
            <li> I should also note that my nails need to be trimmed more often than ever, and I have to shave, (legs, underarms), more frequently!  </li>
            <li> It has a nice natural smell that all of us enjoy.</li>
            <li> My hair felt like it wasn&#x27;t clean.  </li>
            <li> My hair always feels clean, fuller and I have gained length since using this product</li>
            <li> Good price for a 14 oz product that I would have paid way more from a hair supply or some other store.</li>
            <li> I feel good knowing the ingredients are better for my health than conventional shampoos.</li>
            <li> It takes 2 full tablespoons to get that result with this product.</li>
            <li> I had to use twice as much just to be able to comb my hair -and</li>
            <li> Different packaging would be a good idea.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t really feel like its cleaning my hair, more like its drying it out.</li>
            <li> My four stars is based solely on the fact that it&#x27;s a good conditioner and not that it created extra thickness.</li>
            <li> and then I feel like maybe I need to put more in (which I refuse to do because then I&#x27;ll run out too fast).</li>
            <li> , I love it so much.</li>
            <li> I suspect this would be from the internal good</li>
            <li> I suspect this would be from the internal good</li>
            <li> My hair is much thicker and has more body and volume.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner, it makes my hair feel very soft.</li>
            <li> (SO much better!), coconut oil, argan oil, jojoba, and the occasional egg</li>
            <li> Not only does this conditioner keep my hair full, soft, and shiny all day, but is also great to use.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying some more when I&#x27;m out of this one!</li>
            <li> My nails, which I keep short, need to be cut once every week to 10 days as opposed to once every 3 or more weeks!  </li>
            <li> My nails, which I keep short, need to be cut once every week to 10 days as opposed to once every 3 or more weeks!  </li>
            <li> Fresh.  </li>
            <li> You do pay more than double for that shampoo, but having something that supports your hair, improves the texture, and smells fantastic, was worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I chanced upon this product because my hair fall has reduced considerably and the quality is also improving.</li>
            <li> And its a very good value for the size however, it doesn&#x27;t seem to make my hair as soft as some other products.</li>
            <li> I have older fine hair and the shampoo</li>
            <li> When first using the conditioner it may seem as if you need to use more than normal, but give it some work first.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I noticed any difference  with thickening between this conditioner and any other that I used, but it&#x27;s a good conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Being a long haired guy, I&#x27;ve developed a preference for the more natural shampoos and conditioners, but really wasn&#x27;t happy with this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but NOT worth $20</li>
            <li> The conditioner is foamy and goes a long way, feels nice</li>
            <li> but it seems kind of dry</li>
            <li> This happened a couple of years ago, but I see they still haven&#x27;t changed the formula back to the good old one, so I thought I should warn others about this \\&quot;conditioner\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice a change in volume and texture, ..I will continue to buy both products because I like the natural ingredients and wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> but you don&#x27;t have to use very much.</li>
            <li> It worked fine for me, but if you&#x27;re looking for something truly all natural</li>
            <li> i bought it for my little sister ,she said it&#x27;s good for her hair about her hair lose</li>
            <li> However, it dries my hair out (even when used with the conditioner) and leaves my scalp pretty itchy.</li>
            <li> I have average-to-dry curly hair, that I like to let air-dry in order to enjoy its natural curl.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it several times just to make sure that it&#x27;s not a case of my hair needing to adjust.</li>
            <li> In the last year or so I&#x27;ve noticed that I am losing a lot more hair than I would like or would like to admit.</li>
            <li> Rather than leaving my hair softer and more manageable (which is a conditioner&#x27;s most basic function), this conditioner left a noticeable, waxy residue in my hair.</li>
            <li> It definitely makes your hair thicker, but make sure you get it rinsed out thoroughly or hair will look greasy.  </li>
            <li> I actually think it made my hair tangle more.  </li>
            <li> This smelled pretty herbal for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for several years now, and am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> 6/8/2013, first review</li>
            <li> it might not be a good everyday use.</li>
            <li> Better than many other natural shampoos.</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling very clean.</li>
            <li> If I had thick hair, I&#x27;d probably love this :-)</li>
            <li> I have used many different organic types of shampoo/conditioner and never have had to use this much.  </li>
            <li> All the reviews were so positive here</li>
            <li> I like this pretty much</li>
            <li> I get more for less money and the shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long to review this product but my hair definitely feels good.</li>
            <li> Have been using Avalon for a few years and still love it!</li>
            <li> noticed the difference after first use, highly recommended</li>
            <li> works really well</li>
            <li> It became much cheaper just after my order.</li>
            <li> So much so that I had to cut 4 inches off.</li>
            <li> and I was really hopeful.</li>
            <li> This conditioner does not make my hair smooth enough to get my tangle out.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t really tell if it does anything for my hair.  </li>
            <li> It really helps the hair to look fuller and to grow.</li>
            <li> I got this organic conditioner to use with the Pura d&#x27;or shampoo and the combination really works.  </li>
            <li> Hehe ,but I  think the transportation expenses is too much</li>
            <li> I had to use a lot to get my whole hair with the product and did not care for the feeling of my hair after rinsing</li>
            <li> The appearance of thickness is all I really care about.</li>
            <li> I really like the Avalon Organics Thickening Shampoo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very drying.</li>
            <li> but I really look forward to how this product will help me grow out my hair</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really seen any results either.</li>
            <li> Very dissappointed</li>
            <li> I rub it gently on my scalp &amp; throughout my hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel like it cleans or softens real well</li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels much stronger.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is kind of heavy</li>
            <li> The Shampoo is harsh but effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a cream that I rub gently onto wet hair.</li>
            <li> I am not certain if I love this corresponding conditioner, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have long color treated hair and when using this product I find my hair is easy to manage after shampooing, no tangles.</li>
            <li> I share this conditioner with two other housemates and we LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Shampoo was ok but after using the conditioner I needed to use my detangler or use my other conditioners.</li>
            <li> I rcvd two complements on my hair this past week, about how shiny &amp;healthy it looks!  </li>

            <li> Use what you would normally use, and gently work it around the ends of your hair, really rubbing it all around, then move your way up, you should have plenty.  </li>
            <li> I have medium long, fine hair.</li>
            <li> , I have fine hair and it made my hair feel thick and strong.</li>
            <li> The morning after using it, my hair is pretty oily, but really soft.</li>
            <li> wow just noticed for the first time I HAVE NO FRIZZ.</li>
            <li> I have to use a trememdously large amount in order to get any type of actual conditioning feeling in my hair with this...literally 1/4-1/3 of a cup worth.</li>
            <li> I can say for sure that the stimulating scalp part does work because I can feel a slight tingling in my scalp just after I use it.</li>
            <li> I see less hair in the comb and more on my head.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Had high hopes for it, and it did not deliver.&lt;br</li>
            <li> mostly pleased by the ingredients for a natural way to thicken hair growth without using the toxic ingredients in other brands at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> hope this helps you recover your hair, and your self-esteem, a little faster and more efficiently.</li>
            <li> hope this helps you recover your hair, and your self-esteem, a little faster and more efficiently.</li>
            <li> Then let it sit for a few minutes before rinsing (I shampoo my hair first thing, put the conditioner in, then wash my face and body, shave, then rinse the conditioner out lightly).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather see people get something that will improve their self-esteem immediately, rather than give them new problems to worry about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hope is that this is the case for my scalp &amp; maybe, just maybe, I&#x27;ll see some new sprouts.</li>
            <li> New hair?  </li>
            <li> is that this is the case for my scalp &amp; maybe, just maybe, I&#x27;ll see some new sprouts.</li>
            <li> New hair?  </li>
            <li> I gave it many tries and it had the same effect.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There isn&#x27;t a strong scent to this conditioner, but it does have a slight earthy or bark-like aromatic smell as you&#x27;re applying it.</li>
            <li> When I first started using this back in February 2013, my thinning hair stopped shedding completely!</li>
            <li> My hair is much more thicker and fuller than any products I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> but I bought several bottles since my first purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes to curling quickly and has natural waves if I let it air dry.</li>
            <li> This left my hair feeling VERY greasy after only one day, which is pretty unacceptable.  </li>
            <li> Other conditioners are slimy and just rinse right out of my hair, but this one is absorbed and does the trick all day long.</li>
            <li> My curls are always soft and poppin after each&lt;br /&gt;use.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something natural.</li>
            <li> I preferred the results from the old formula.</li>
            <li> So far after about 6 uses, my hair is thicker and fuller.</li>
            <li> It is cheaper and make your hair soft and weightless as well.</li>
            <li> However, I do really like the Biotin B-Complex shampoo by the same brand and would recommend that product.</li>
            <li> Did not make my hair feel soft or moisturized.  </li>
            <li> So far does not seem to &amp;#34;thicken&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> no frizz, natural curls (when did I have curls??)  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product that I have been using for a few years.</li>
            <li> This is because one application of shampoo with DHT-fighting ingredients, can only do so much.</li>

            <li> I purchased the shampoo and conditioner for my 80 year old mother.</li>
            <li> its short so there should be no reason i should have to use this much conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I have thin curly hair that has a mind of its own</li>
            <li> Nice thick conditioner makes your hair feel really smooth and thick.</li>
            <li> it really make your hair thick, and leaves soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Your body is constantly generating new hormones and new DHT.</li>

            <li> A 32 year old male and recently grew my hair out for the first time since my teens.</li>
            <li> The shampoo lathers if you work at it, &amp; it&#x27;s a low lather rather than a high and luffy one.</li>
            <li> Mine is fine, thin, and straight.</li>
            <li> I must say that THIS IS NOT the same formulation (in my opinion) as past formulations I&#x27;ve used were FAR MORE conditioning and a completely different texture.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner not only seems watered down but it really doesnt do much for my hair either.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this conditioner to anyone especially if your&lt;br /&gt;a natural girl.</li>
            <li> The conditioner has a quite an extensive list of natural oils and ingredients.</li>
            <li> Did not make hair soft or feel thicker just left tangled.</li>
            <li> It barely did anything for my hair.  </li>
            <li> the price is not bad, since it takes a few drops to do the job, even with long hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was a sticky, tangly mess, like I had put glue in my hair and really rubbed it in.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine like a baby&#x27;s and rather thin.  </li>
            <li> When I opened the first one and squeezed a little conditioner onto my hand, I thought, oh no, this is not conditioner!</li>
            <li> When I first opened the conditioner, it was really a really thick and creamy appearance, but the second I put it in my hair, it lost all of its integrity and seemingly barely covered my hair!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find shampoo and conditioner that are natural and sulphate free/safe for colored hair for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This is coming from a 36 year old woman who has been fighting repeated hair loss due to hormonal imbalance from 16 on.</li>

            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to comment as to whether or not it actually makes hair thicker, but my hair does feel healthier.</li>
            <li> First of all, it is really hard to squeeze out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> This and the accompanying shampoo are one of the few hair product lines that actually make my fine hair feel truly thick.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used long enough to see if it gives a thicker appearance to hair.</li>
            <li> I like when conditioners don&#x27;t weigh my hair down and make it soft.</li>
            <li> it left my hair feeling dry.</li>
            <li> or so I&#x27;ve gone natural - no hair products with harsh chemicals; I went no-poo for a short while.</li>
            <li> A few ingredients have a * and are marked organic, but the entire product is not.  </li>
            <li> I had such high hopes, but in only two shampooings, my hair was noticeably stripped of oils, had that &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; feeling you get when using a very harsh product, and it became dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> Having said that, I ordered this conditioner because it promises to thicken the hair shaft naturally; however, when I applied it through my hair, it did little if anything to de-tangle.</li>
            <li> does not work makes my hair feel dirty and made my  hair fall out even more, will never buy again</li>
            <li> I really like the Biotin B Complex Thickening Conditioner (and shampoo).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s changed, but I CAN TELL YOU that I will NOT be purchasing this again anytime in the near future.  </li>
            <li> It smelled like lemons though and it lasted for a long time.</li>
            <li> This does well with my mop of silver hair, which has thinned some since I stopped being middle aged and moved on.  </li>
            <li> Conditioners generally leave my hair greasy or weighed down but not this one.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair soft and instead leaves your hair stiff.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this could possibly be thickening my hair when I lose so much of it due to knots.  </li>
            <li> My hair is definitely stronger due to the Biotin which is proven to strengthen hair and nails.</li>
            <li> I know that a lot of people will be drawn to Avalon because of the low price, but if it drastically stripped my extremely oily hair in two shampoos, I can&#x27;t imagine what it might do to yours.</li>
            <li> Big difference in ingredients when compared to other &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; shampoos or conditioners.</li>
            <li> Like straw in the shower, when it&#x27;s dry I may as well have used nothing.</li>
            <li> After I blow dry my hair</li>
            <li> When I rinsed it out, my hair had a dry and straw-ish consistency.</li>
            <li> After washing, I wrap in a towel for about 5 minutes, apply FINESSE styling mousse, let my brown curls air dry.</li>
            <li> Still losing less hair, AND there IS new hair growth in little stray spots.  </li>
            <li> Still losing less hair, AND there IS new hair growth in little stray spots.  </li>
            <li> I have spent hundreds of dollars on other products without getting the same results.</li>
            <li> these past couple of years have thinned (maybe too cuz I&#x27;m getting old)...</li>
            <li> and I failed to realize the importance of tried and true testing.</li>
            <li> it actually seems to weigh it down.</li>
            <li> My hair is slowly growing back after I went through major hair loss (postpartum pregnancy).</li>
            <li> I have really oily hair and usually have to wash it everyday but this stuff doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily and can go a day without washing it.</li>
            <li> This wouldnt be SO bad if i didnt have super fine and thin hair to begin with and</li>
            <li> At least it&#x27;s natural and it&#x27;s not doing any damage!</li>
            <li> I used with companion shampoo and my hair was very dry and couldnt get a wide toth comb thru it.</li>
            <li> but with a little extra water it works well.</li>
            <li> Hairstyle - long enough to run a comb through, usually let it grow for 1.5 months then cut</li>
            <li> This is the only conditioner that I can use everyday.  </li>
            <li> Not very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> They left her hair looking limp and greasy.</li>
            <li> After trying several other brands with little effect, the Avalon Biotin B-Complex started showing results in 30 days.</li>
            <li> With the thick feel in the shower, I am surprised that it&#x27;s not weighted down after styling.</li>
            <li> Not a good value at nearly 10 dollars for the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I thought I would warn future buyers of a few negative aspects I personally experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I would hesitate to try any other hair products offered by this company.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it is due to my highlights....</li>
            <li> However, unlike other conditioners, it does not detangle hair.</li>
            <li> I opened another bottle, thought, maybe something was wrong with the first one.</li>
            <li> I would buy this product again and a little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unsure if that&#x27;s due to the Biotin supplements or the shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this conditioner in the past and recently re-purchased.  </li>
            <li> I am washing my hair every day, where I used to wash every other day.</li>
            <li> I was very excited about this product after reading its reviews but was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Although there is NO new hair growth, I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;M LOSING LESS HAIR when I wash &amp; style!  </li>
            <li> I believe this shampoo was watered down at some point.</li>
            <li> even after rewash it still wasn&#x27;t easy to manage. :(</li>
            <li> There seems to be less hair on the bathroom floor and around the sink.</li>
            <li> but thats typical for wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Slight burning sensation.</li>
            <li> Really an odd product to be called conditioner?</li>
            <li> even then I was a tangled mess.  </li>
            <li> If scrub too hard, I&#x27;ll lose MORE HAIR. :(</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write negative reviews since customers aren&#x27;t always looking for the same things.</li>
            <li> A little pricey</li>
            <li> I can tell a difference in the texture of my hair after using, the fragrance is a little off putting</li>
            <li> Not very pleased.</li>
            <li> but it totally dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> Makes my otherwise Limp hair bouncer.</li>
            <li> I used to iron my frizz but was in a hurry and it naturally dried...</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell was okay.&lt;br /&gt;It was harsh and stripping on the hair follicles.&lt;br /&gt;Left</li>
            <li> Also, my hairstyle is a lot easier and fuller looking (messy and pushed up in the front).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> does not work, make my hair stick together, not smooth at all</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had the same experience as other reviewers.</li>
            <li> I usually start applying at my tips and slowly working my way up to about 4\\&quot; away from my roots, but I was having such a hard time working it up</li>
            <li> Leaves a greasy, rough film behind, and makes my hair feel coarse, stiff, and weirdly not-even-washed when dry.</li>
            <li> I might get a serum to tame it</li>
            <li> I did notice that for the past two weeks, when I use the products, my scalp gets just a little itchy.  </li>
            <li> I did notice that for the past two weeks, when I use the products, my scalp gets just a little itchy.  </li>
            <li> 19 days in, w/ consistent use of shamp/cond &amp; Maxi Hair, my hair is smoother, softer, shinier stronger, doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell, still not weighty &amp; continues to be manageable.</li>
            <li> A little hard to use though.</li>
            <li> It was a little hard for me to lather</li>
            <li> Waste of mint!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure if that is why I had this reaction.</li>
            <li> I will NOT be buying more, and I&#x27;m outraged!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if that makes a difference</li>
            <li> I actually threw it away and now use random conditioner from target instead.  </li>
            <li> Usually with organic shampoos and conditioners you have to cake on the shampoo and conditioners, not these.  </li>
            <li> We were pretty disappointed with this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> If anything I usually border on having my hair be too silky and need things to volumize</li>
            <li> not sure it is doing anything at all to save my remaining hair.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m shocked at how long it is lasting.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m shocked at how long it is lasting.</li>
            <li> What a waste of conditioner!</li>
            <li> I do notice that my hair has grown a bit faster this past month or two.</li>
            <li> Major disappointment.</li>
            <li> &amp; I think that I&#x27;m going to have a BAD HAIR DAY ahead of me, but after styling, it&#x27;s actually soft, manageable, not weighty!</li>
            <li> It hardly detangles my hair after shampooing at all.</li>
            <li> I use the conditioner too and both of them I find hard to cover my head and the cond.</li>
            <li> Felt dull and course.  </li>
            <li> but you can hardly get your comb through after you use the conditioner.</li>
            <li> At least my hair wouldn&#x27;t be smelling like an herbal plant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like my hair just sucks it in</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too thick to get out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> The conditional is so thick that it does not flow out when you want to use it.</li>
            <li> I am looking for volume because I already have thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Avalon is only 70% organic and it had a rather unpleasant smell to me.</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> My hair still falls out and it&#x27;s not a good product.</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago the shedding picked up again, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t thick or thin.</li>
            <li> Big bummer as I bought 3 bottles of this stuff :(</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bottles are SMALL so I&#x27;m not using it carelessly.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like to use it, as I need to squeeze the bottle very hard to make it come out.</li>
            <li> It started looking very dull.</li>
            <li> I used an expensive &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; (aka expensive for no reason) product that dried out my hair and caused it to break...</li>
            <li> This can be problematic when you already have thin hair.</li>
            <li> One of them is broken, the liquid flowed out all over the place...</li>
            <li> My hair is also really thin</li>
            <li> I also feel like an idiot for not noticing the sulfates and other damaging ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Smell isn&#x27;t terrible, but it&#x27;s not good</li>
            <li> It got tangled up horribly bad</li>
            <li> The bad is</li>
            <li> After using this, my hair would be badly tangled and gnarled.</li>
            <li> After I managed to comb through it, my hair wouldn&#x27;t feel bad for the rest of the day...</li>
            <li> I  recommend it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed .</li>
            <li> Hated it.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed and won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> I was so very disappointed with my purchase of the Avalon Thickening shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> This, however, make my hair feel disgusting!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is horrible.</li>
            <li> Worst of all, my hair is so tangled and matted after I wash it that I have to brush it, and I lose all my curls.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful.  </li>
            <li> As for quality, it is horrible.</li>
            <li> I hate this shampoo!</li>
            <li> However, the conditioner is awful.  </li>

            <li> works really well, I have fine hair and it made my hair feel thick and strong.</li>
            <li> Need quite a handful to disperse in hair.  Not a good value at nearly 10 dollars for the bottle.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I like when conditioners don&#x27;t weigh my hair down and make it soft. This, however, make my hair feel disgusting! It got tangled up horribly bad an felt like there was some gross film on my hair at all times. I bought both the shampoo and conditioner and havenonlybused them twice. Waste of mint!</li>
            <li> Seems to be great, my wife has the problem of lossing hair, and it seems this product could make her hair grow faster.</li>
            <li> This is the only conditioner that I can use everyday.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel &amp;#34;heavy.&amp;#34;  This is my second bottle.</li>
            <li> It became much cheaper just after my order.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using this conditioner along with Nexxus Viatress Biotin Shampoo. These products have definitely helped her hair to grow back.</li>
            <li> Thicker, fuller, shinier, healthier hair thanks to this product!!!</li>
            <li> It drys my hair.  Make my hair tingled together.  Not good.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t believe it!  noticed the difference after first use, highly recommended</li>
            <li> Did not notice a difference and the condition does not de tangle at all</li>
            <li> I recommend this conditioner to anyone especially if your&lt;br /&gt;a natural girl. My curls are always soft and poppin after each&lt;br /&gt;use. The best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used yet!!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had the same experience as other reviewers. This left my hair feeling VERY greasy after only one day, which is pretty unacceptable.  I feel like I have to use my clarifying shampoo once a week, which frankly shouldn&#x27;t be happening with a sulfate-free shampoo. I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in hair growth, either. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write negative reviews since customers aren&#x27;t always looking for the same things. I thought I would warn future buyers of a few negative aspects I personally experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I believe this shampoo was watered down at some point. Through experience, a shampoo is most effective when it can build up a good lather and foam up nicely. It takes 2 full tablespoons to get that result with this product. I don&#x27;t believe that&#x27;s normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The shampoo is quite drying and makes my hair feel like straw. All my short whisps reach for the sky. (Even with the same brand conditioner). This is what I&#x27;m trying to avoid!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect different hair types will react differently, so here&#x27;s the makeup of mine: My hair isn&#x27;t thick or thin. It takes to curling quickly and has natural waves if I let it air dry. I&#x27;ve colored it on and off for 20 years but in the last 6 months or so I&#x27;ve gone natural - no hair products with harsh chemicals; I went no-poo for a short while. Now I use Dessert Essence shampoo/conditioner (SO much better!), coconut oil, argan oil, jojoba, and the occasional egg mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this about a month now. There seems to be less hair on the bathroom floor and around the sink. However, it dries my hair out (even when used with the conditioner) and leaves my scalp pretty itchy. The morning after using it, my hair is pretty oily, but really soft.</li>
            <li> Good quality, it is worth to repurchase</li>
            <li> I have been using this for quite sometime now and am very happy for this product. It makes my hair look fuller and shiny :-)</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel like I haven&#x27;t even used conditioner. Like straw in the shower, when it&#x27;s dry I may as well have used nothing.</li>
            <li> best conditioner ever- better than most shampoos and conditioners (salon brand included) out there in the market. Love the aveda-ish ajurvedic smell. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have average-to-dry curly hair, that I like to let air-dry in order to enjoy its natural curl. This conditioner is horrible. I&#x27;ve tried it several times just to make sure that it&#x27;s not a case of my hair needing to adjust. It hardly detangles my hair after shampooing at all. Leaves a greasy, rough film behind, and makes my hair feel coarse, stiff, and weirdly not-even-washed when dry. Worst of all, my hair is so tangled and matted after I wash it that I have to brush it, and I lose all my curls. I am kicking myself for buying a giant bottle of this without ever trying it. That&#x27;s what I get for letting myself be wooed by the promises on the label.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful.  It doesn&#x27;t condition your hair at all.  The thickening shampoo is awesome but don&#x27;t buy the conditioner.  It&#x27;s gross.  Use the shampoo with another conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner, it makes my hair feel very soft. I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to comment as to whether or not it actually makes hair thicker, but my hair does feel healthier. And I love the minty/herbal smell.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Leaves hair feeling light and clean, removes buildup from styling products. It makes me feel better that it&#x27;s organic as well!</li>
            <li> Did not help hair growth for my type of hair</li>
            <li> In the last year or so I&#x27;ve noticed that I am losing a lot more hair than I would like or would like to admit. I wanted to try something natural. I used this for a month and noticed no difference in hair loss but it totally dried out my hair. So much so that I had to cut 4 inches off. I have color processed hair and I&#x27;m not sure if that is why I had this reaction. All the reviews were so positive here and I was really hopeful. I ended up buy Rogaine and that has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner. Makes my otherwise Limp hair bouncer.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo for hair growth but didn&#x27;t notice a difference. It smelled like lemons though and it lasted for a long time.Better than many other natural shampoos.</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t like this product.  I had to use twice as much just to be able to comb my hair -and even then I was a tangled mess.  I love that it&#x27;s organic, but just didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> Rather than leaving my hair softer and more manageable (which is a conditioner&#x27;s most basic function), this conditioner left a noticeable, waxy residue in my hair. I wonder if this gross waxy film is what makes your hair feel \\&quot;thicker and fuller\\&quot;. It does not glide on to hair very smoothly and smells like Pine Sol. Major disappointment. I won&#x27;t be ordering this again and I would hesitate to try any other hair products offered by this company.</li>
            <li> it really make your hair thick, and leaves soft and clean. use with the same shampoo, great products if you want a full head of hair, and helps growth too!</li>
            <li> I preferred the results from the old formula.</li>
            <li> Not only does this conditioner keep my hair full, soft, and shiny all day, but is also great to use.  Other conditioners are slimy and just rinse right out of my hair, but this one is absorbed and does the trick all day long.</li>
            <li> It definitely makes your hair thicker, but make sure you get it rinsed out thoroughly or hair will look greasy.  I would probably buy again, but practice with it before your fixing your hair to go somewhere!</li>
            <li> Not very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I love it. Will buy again! although it is a bit drying. it might not be a good everyday use.</li>
            <li> It simply does not work with my hair. It seems as if I am adding water and not a conditioner. Tried after different types of shampoos and it is always the same. Perhaps it is due to my highlights.... I do not recommend it at all.</li>
            <li> Nice, smells good. Yes it thickens. A little hard to use though. It&#x27;s too thick to get out of the bottle. Different packaging would be a good idea.</li>
            <li> I was very excited about this product after reading its reviews but was disappointed. The smell does not bother me at all. First of all, it is really hard to squeeze out of the bottle. The conditioner is kind of heavy and it seems like you have to use a lot of it to evenly spread it on you hair. I&#x27;ve used it and I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;m pulling even more hair out while rinsing this conditioner. After drying, my hair looked kind of greasy/oily. At the end of the day I felt like I have to wash my hair again. I didn&#x27;t like that. I gave it many tries and it had the same effect. I love their shampoo and I use it, but I didn&#x27;t like this conditioner.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner did what it says. It made my thinning hair feel and look thicker. I  recommend it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed .</li>
            <li> My hair is fine like a baby&#x27;s and rather thin.  This conditioner gives it fullness and thickness I&#x27;ve never had before.  I will be buying more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 4/17/14:  I was about to purchase another bottle of this for someone else and noticed the price has more than doubled since I first purchased it a month or two ago.  I will NOT be buying more, and I&#x27;m outraged!  It&#x27;s good, but NOT worth $20+ !</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great.  It lathers well and my hair does feel thicker when I use it. I feel good knowing the ingredients are better for my health than conventional shampoos.</li>
            <li> I got this conditioner to go with the shampoo they make.  I do like the fragrance.  Fresh.  This conditioner does not make my hair smooth enough to get my tangle out.  I use it first and then use a bit of my usual conditioner so that I am not tearing out my highlights after washing.  I did notice a bit of thickening of my hair shafts.  My hair did seem a bit fuller.</li>
            <li> It makes it look like I have dandruff, but I don&#x27;t, but I didn&#x27;t use it with their shampoo.  I&#x27;m not sure if that makes a difference</li>
            <li> So far after about 6 uses, my hair is thicker and fuller. I might get a serum to tame it but thats typical for wavy hair. I love that it&#x27;s organic too! Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair soft and instead leaves your hair stiff. My hair still falls out and it&#x27;s not a good product.</li>
            <li> Have been using Avalon for a few years and still love it!</li>
            <li> Slight burning sensation. Did not see chamomile on ingredient list I found online and am allergic. Left hair with zero shine.</li>
            <li> I got this conditioner to go with the same brand shampoo.  I have older fine hair and the shampoo is great but I felt like I needed an ocassional conditioning.  I like this pretty much but it seems kind of dry and I can&#x27;t really tell if it does anything for my hair.  I don&#x27;t know if I will get this same brand next time I need conditioner or not.</li>
            <li> Another great product.  Just love this Biotin B-complex thickening conditioner.  It really helps the hair to look fuller and to grow.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used long enough to see if it gives a thicker appearance to hair. However, unlike other conditioners, it does not detangle hair. This can be problematic when you already have thin hair.</li>
            <li> Please avoid this product. The conditional is so thick that it does not flow out when you want to use it. As for quality, it is horrible. It makes your hair sticky as if you haven&#x27;t rinsed your hair for days. I don&#x27;t see any good using it. I finally use Dove that I bought at Costco. It is cheaper and make your hair soft and weightless as well.</li>
            <li> When doing your shampoo becomes a favorite part of your day, you can bet you are using this stuff.  It is very refreshing and no wait time for the conditioner to work.</li>
            <li> I got this organic conditioner to use with the Pura d&#x27;or shampoo and the combination really works.  My hair is manageable, thicker and shines.  I would recommend it especially if you&#x27;re like me...middle aged...with hair that just didn&#x27;t have the shine or feel that my hair used to have.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know if it makes my hair thicker or healthier, but it feels good and thought it was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is okay. For it to be effective, I have to mix it with another conditioner. However, I do really like the Biotin B-Complex shampoo by the same brand and would recommend that product.</li>
            <li> I got this shampoo to help build up and give vitamins to my fine hair. It&#x27;s ok but it doesn&#x27;t really feel like its cleaning my hair, more like its drying it out. I use the conditioner too and both of them I find hard to cover my head and the cond. does n&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s doing anything. I wont be getting this again.</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 bottles. One of them is broken, the liquid flowed out all over the place...</li>
            <li> i bought it for my little sister ,she said it&#x27;s good for her hair about her hair lose</li>
            <li> I hate this shampoo! It mentions organic on bottle,but that is misleading! This item is NOT organic,AND gave me BUMPS!!! YES BUMPS on my head!</li>
            <li> Good price for a 14 oz product that I would have paid way more from a hair supply or some other store.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this. I used with companion shampoo and my hair was very dry and couldnt get a wide toth comb thru it. even after rewash it still wasn&#x27;t easy to manage. :( I sent this product and the shampo back. Big disapointment.</li>
            <li> I share this conditioner with two other housemates and we LOVE it. It has a nice natural smell that all of us enjoy. I have very, very fine hair. Conditioners generally leave my hair greasy or weighed down but not this one. One of the house mates has curly hair and she loves it too. I have seen a huge difference. My boyfriend even loves it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month. The good is that my hairs feels soft and silky and smells nice. The bad is I see no improvement with thickening. The conditioner is foamy and goes a long way, feels nice, it&#x27;s a good conditioner, it just doesn&#x27;t do much to thicken my hair.</li>
            <li> Being a long haired guy, I&#x27;ve developed a preference for the more natural shampoos and conditioners, but really wasn&#x27;t happy with this. After using this, my hair would be badly tangled and gnarled. Even perhaps matted toward the ends. After I managed to comb through it, my hair wouldn&#x27;t feel bad for the rest of the day... but something about it really made my hair tangle up and feel really dried up in the ends.</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my hair feel.  I have thin curly hair that has a mind of its own but since I started using this product i&#x27;ve noticed that it grows faster, thicker and it&#x27;s bouncier than before!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I have really oily hair and usually have to wash it everyday but this stuff doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily and can go a day without washing it. My hair is also really thin and this seems to plump it up.</li>
            <li> There was nothing conditioning about this.  I actually think it made my hair tangle more.  Really an odd product to be called conditioner?</li>
            <li> When I first started using this back in February 2013, my thinning hair stopped shedding completely! A few weeks ago the shedding picked up again, unfortunately. I loved this shampoo and conditioner while it was working. I also feel like an idiot for not noticing the sulfates and other damaging ingredients in it. How can it be labeled organic when it&#x27;s loaded with sulfates? Very disappointed and won&#x27;t be buying again. Check your labels, I&#x27;ve noticed a lot of shampoos that claim to be organic have sulfates!</li>
            <li> I cannot believe something so wonderful just changed overnight into sticky glue like waxy goop. I had ordered several bottles because this used to be my \\&quot;conditioner for life\\&quot;. When I opened the first one and squeezed a little conditioner onto my hand, I thought, oh no, this is not conditioner! I ended up putting it in my hair anyway, and I was terrified. My hair was a sticky, tangly mess, like I had put glue in my hair and really rubbed it in. I opened another bottle, thought, maybe something was wrong with the first one. Same thing. I had send all of it back. They were nice about the return though. This happened a couple of years ago, but I see they still haven&#x27;t changed the formula back to the good old one, so I thought I should warn others about this \\&quot;conditioner\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I did not like the product, gave it all away to a women&#x27;s shelter.</li>
            <li> A 32 year old male and recently grew my hair out for the first time since my teens. I used an expensive &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; (aka expensive for no reason) product that dried out my hair and caused it to break... In two uses this stuff moisturized it and has it looking fuller than ever. I get more for less money and the shipping was quick. Recommend this to anyone and everyone</li>
            <li> This smelled pretty herbal for me. It didn&#x27;t thicken my hair or anything it claimed to. I prefer to just take biotin pills instead. At least my hair wouldn&#x27;t be smelling like an herbal plant.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner on the market even if you do not have thinning and damaged hair like I do.</li>
            <li> is a great product , leave my hair clean and whit much vitamint, i love it. i buy champoo too and is amazing.</li>
            <li> Hated it.  Did not make my hair feel soft or moisturized.  Felt dull and course.  I would like my money back!!</li>
            <li> So far does not seem to &amp;#34;thicken&amp;#34; my hair...it actually seems to weigh it down.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this could possibly be thickening my hair when I lose so much of it due to knots.  Love the shampoo but you can hardly get your comb through after you use the conditioner.</li>
            <li> This shampoo effect is obvious</li>
            <li> I did not like the conditioner seems that it is not a conditioner at all ... Shampoo was ok but after using the conditioner I needed to use my detangler or use my other conditioners.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous types of of hair thickening shampoos and conditioner.  This is the best so far.  A little pricey but you don&#x27;t have to use very much.</li>
            <li> Definitely works as advertise. My hair is much more thicker and fuller than any products I have used in the past. I have spent hundreds of dollars on other products without getting the same results. Excellent customer service and super fast S&amp;H</li>
            <li> I like it .I think it will good for my hair. Hehe ,but I  think the transportation expenses is too much</li>
            <li> Not moisturizing at all.  I actually threw it away and now use random conditioner from target instead.  Big bummer as I bought 3 bottles of this stuff :(</li>
            <li> Bought to go with the shampoo, nothing has ever worked and smelled so good as this.  Usually with organic shampoos and conditioners you have to cake on the shampoo and conditioners, not these.  When first using the conditioner it may seem as if you need to use more than normal, but give it some work first.  Use what you would normally use, and gently work it around the ends of your hair, really rubbing it all around, then move your way up, you should have plenty.  Then let it sit for a few minutes before rinsing (I shampoo my hair first thing, put the conditioner in, then wash my face and body, shave, then rinse the conditioner out lightly).  My hair is so soft, styles well, no frizz, and feels so good! I will never change shampoo/conditioners again!&lt;br /&gt;(See my review for the shampoo under the same headline).</li>
            <li> I had to use a lot to get my whole hair with the product and did not care for the feeling of my hair after rinsing</li>
            <li> I have been using Avalon Thickening Conditioner for about 2 years now, and I&#x27;m pleased with this product. The conditioner has a quite an extensive list of natural oils and ingredients. I can say for sure that the stimulating scalp part does work because I can feel a slight tingling in my scalp just after I use it. I believe this is for stimulating blood flow to the scalp. It does nourish my hair without leaving it feeling too greasy when it dries out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There isn&#x27;t a strong scent to this conditioner, but it does have a slight earthy or bark-like aromatic smell as you&#x27;re applying it. As you can tell from the picture the consistency is very similar to hand lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m mostly pleased by the ingredients for a natural way to thicken hair growth without using the toxic ingredients in other brands at the grocery store. The price is usually pretty excellent on Amazon compared to my local health store. I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I noticed any difference  with thickening between this conditioner and any other that I used, but it&#x27;s a good conditioner.  It has a good texture and consistency and does moisturize and make the hair feel stronger.  However, I can&#x27;t say that I noticed any thickening.  My four stars is based solely on the fact that it&#x27;s a good conditioner and not that it created extra thickness.</li>
            <li> the best shampoo going for the hair that has turned from silver to white.  Great body when enhanced by the conditioner same brand.  best price on the internet</li>
            <li> wow just noticed for the first time I HAVE NO FRIZZ. I used to iron my frizz but was in a hurry and it naturally dried...no frizz, natural curls (when did I have curls??)  Happy with this product!!</li>
            <li> After trying several other brands with little effect, the Avalon Biotin B-Complex started showing results in 30 days.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok but I don&#x27;t like to use it, as I need to squeeze the bottle very hard to make it come out. They should change the packing to dump dispenser.</li>
            <li> Did not make hair soft or feel thicker just left tangled. Not recommended to those wanting to feel hair feeling fuller</li>
            <li> When I started having problems with my hair falling out, I bought this and now it&#x27;s a constant for hair washing.  My hair is definitely stronger due to the Biotin which is proven to strengthen hair and nails.</li>
            <li> It really did thickening my hair, and made it smell great.. Thank You</li>
            <li> We were pretty disappointed with this shampoo and conditioner. Had high hopes for it, and it did not deliver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell was okay.&lt;br /&gt;It was harsh and stripping on the hair follicles.&lt;br /&gt;Left our hair with that squeaky clean feeling, but not in a good way, more in a removed all the oil from your hair kinda away.&lt;br /&gt;Even in using the conditioner, my hair still looked frizzy. And I do not have frizzy hair! Mine is fine, thin, and straight. If anything I usually border on having my hair be too silky and need things to volumize it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just cannot recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have changed an earlier review on this product. My fault, I was a newbie to the reviewer world and I failed to realize the importance of tried and true testing. 160 reviews later I get it. It took 3 different products and a very specific combination of products to achieve the texture that I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me - 28 this month. V shaped hairline. Hairstyle - long enough to run a comb through, usually let it grow for 1.5 months then cut back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Biotin B-Complex conditioner is a daily counterbalance to the Biotin Shampoo. The Shampoo is harsh but effective. It leaves my hair feeling like a brillo pad and the conditioner helps break that apart. When used together the signs of balding are significantly reduced (seeing your scalp through the hair). Also, my hairstyle is a lot easier and fuller looking (messy and pushed up in the front).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with the combination I found my hair needing a break from the two. I use Organix Coconut milk conditioner once a week to soften my hair. This is an extremely effective break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The proportions I use suit my taste. The appearance of thickness is all I really care about. I know i&#x27;ll go bald eventually which is why i&#x27;m putting the work in the gym now. You have to be in shape if you&#x27;re bald :)</li>
            <li> I bought the shampoo and figured I had to get the conditioner to go along with it.  Nope.  It barely did anything for my hair.  It was like adding water to my hair.  I even tried to mix it with another conditioner.  Big mistake on that one.  My hair felt like it wasn&#x27;t clean.  Anyway, I would skip this.</li>
            <li> Cleans well and my hair seems thicker.</li>
            <li> It works!  Makes my hair feel very healthy.  I use it about 4x weekly.</li>
            <li> I chose this conditioner because I am trying to go organic as much as possible. Having said that, I ordered this conditioner because it promises to thicken the hair shaft naturally; however, when I applied it through my hair, it did little if anything to de-tangle. It reminds me of body lotion and it might as well have been. I had to use my regular conditioner to de-tangle. I pulled more hair out trying to work this stuff through my hair. I have medium long, fine hair. Maybe it&#x27;s more effective for hair that&#x27;s too short to tangle...Not a total lods, though; I&#x27;m using the rest of it as a shaving creme!</li>
            <li> I love that it is organic. My hair always feels clean, fuller and I have gained length since using this product</li>
            <li> Fantastic product that I have been using for a few years. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great scent and ingredients, but it left my hair feeling dry.</li>
            <li> Amazing conditioner! I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find shampoo and conditioner that are natural and sulphate free/safe for colored hair for a reasonable price. I really like the Avalon Organics Thickening Shampoo. I am not certain if I love this corresponding conditioner, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that when I put it in my hair I still can&#x27;t run my fingers through my hair to comb out the knots. It&#x27;s like my hair just sucks it in and then I feel like maybe I need to put more in (which I refuse to do because then I&#x27;ll run out too fast). After I blow dry my hair it looks great, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to finish the bottle before I decide whether I continue buying this one.</li>
            <li> Good product but not sure it is doing anything at all to save my remaining hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is slowly growing back after I went through major hair loss (postpartum pregnancy). This isn&#x27;t a moisturizing conditioner, though. It&#x27;s very drying. I add Moroccan oil to the ends of my hair after I use this product.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and that its organic. And its a very good value for the size however, it doesn&#x27;t seem to make my hair as soft as some other products. overall though I like it</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long to review this product but my hair definitely feels good.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Leaves my hair clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> A few ingredients have a * and are marked organic, but the entire product is not.  There also isn&#x27;t the USDA seal.  It worked fine for me, but if you&#x27;re looking for something truly all natural this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> I was so very disappointed with my purchase of the Avalon Thickening shampoo and conditioner. I had such high hopes, but in only two shampooings, my hair was noticeably stripped of oils, had that &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; feeling you get when using a very harsh product, and it became dry and brittle. It started looking very dull. They use many products that have an oil stripping effect on the hair, like orange oil and lemon oil. You might think because it says, &#x27;oil&#x27; that it might add to your hair&#x27;s shine, but these are ingredients in industrial strength degreasers. This product only damaged my hair. Avalon is only 70% organic and it had a rather unpleasant smell to me. Rather like mosquito repellant or dish soap. Using a harsh product like this is very detrimental for your hair. I know that a lot of people will be drawn to Avalon because of the low price, but if it drastically stripped my extremely oily hair in two shampoos, I can&#x27;t imagine what it might do to yours. Although my hair is very fine, so perhaps ethnic girls, and women with coarser hair might benefit? I honestly wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. I&#x27;d rather see people get something that will improve their self-esteem immediately, rather than give them new problems to worry about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In desperation I purchased the more expensive Just Naturals system for thinning hair and believe me, it blows Avalon out of the water. In just one shampoo my hair regained it&#x27;s texture and became so silky it felt like Asian hair. I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair now and I feel so much more confident. They use incredible ingredients that greatly benefit people with hair loss due to hormonal issues, or who have an increase in DHT. You do pay more than double for that shampoo, but having something that supports your hair, improves the texture, and smells fantastic, was worth it to me. I&#x27;m now quite confident in what I&#x27;m using and plan to go on using it, regardless of the cost. I&#x27;d pay 5x what I&#x27;m paying for it now, I love it so much. And their treatment spray is oil based. I use the system twice a day and I&#x27;m shocked at how long it is lasting. It has truly been an excellent investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend that you shampoo and condition your hair twice a day if you want to see regrowth with any system. This is because one application of shampoo with DHT-fighting ingredients, can only do so much. Your body is constantly generating new hormones and new DHT. By helping to combat it twice a day, you have a better chance of seeing results sooner. This is coming from a 36 year old woman who has been fighting repeated hair loss due to hormonal imbalance from 16 on. Once a day just never cut it for me. Using a leave on treatment like Just Naturals has overnight, can also work wonders. I use it during the day too if I&#x27;m not going out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps you recover your hair, and your self-esteem, a little faster and more efficiently. :o)nd their treatment spray is oil based.

            <li> This product is great, it has helped my hair a lot! I will definitely be buying some more when I&#x27;m out of this one!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t detangle my hair - it feels as though I skipped conditioner altogether.</li>
            <li> Nice thick conditioner makes your hair feel really smooth and thick. I think the biotin is what does. I would buy this product again and a little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Following my review on the Biotin Thickening Shampoo - I do not care for this product at all. The smell is very similar to lemon Pledge or Lysol. When I first opened the conditioner, it was really a really thick and creamy appearance, but the second I put it in my hair, it lost all of its integrity and seemingly barely covered my hair! I usually start applying at my tips and slowly working my way up to about 4\\&quot; away from my roots, but I was having such a hard time working it up that I had to reapply a couple times. What a waste of conditioner! When I rinsed it out, my hair had a dry and straw-ish consistency. Not very pleased. I do notice that my hair has grown a bit faster this past month or two. I&#x27;m unsure if that&#x27;s due to the Biotin supplements or the shampoo/conditioner. I just end up throwing a bunch of Dove brand leave-in conditioner because of the way this shamp/cond leaves my hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased the shampoo and conditioner for my 80 year old mother. They left her hair looking limp and greasy. Definitely won&#x27;t be buying these again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this conditioner in the past and recently re-purchased.  I must say that THIS IS NOT the same formulation (in my opinion) as past formulations I&#x27;ve used were FAR MORE conditioning and a completely different texture.  I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s changed, but I CAN TELL YOU that I will NOT be purchasing this again anytime in the near future.  Something is definitely amiss here...</li>
            <li> does not work, make my hair stick together, not smooth at all</li>
            <li> This does well with my mop of silver hair, which has thinned some since I stopped being middle aged and moved on.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several years now, and am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I do feel the parts of my hair I use it on is thicker... but I don&#x27;t see how it has stimulated my hair to grow. At least it&#x27;s natural and it&#x27;s not doing any damage! Smell isn&#x27;t terrible, but it&#x27;s not good</li>
            <li> does not work makes my hair feel dirty and made my  hair fall out even more, will never buy again</li>
            <li> I can tell a difference in the texture of my hair after using, the fragrance is a little off putting but I really look forward to how this product will help me grow out my hair</li>
            <li> This product works well with using the Avalon Organics shampoo.  I couldn&#x27;t find&lt;br /&gt;the Avalon conditioner I liked in the stores so I ordered this online.  It is a good product.&lt;br /&gt;I do find though that the thicker conditioners don&#x27;t flow easily from the bottle.</li>
            <li> Great organic product, works pretty much as described. Big difference in ingredients when compared to other &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; shampoos or conditioners.</li>
            <li> Good thickening shampoo</li>
            <li> When I got this in the mail it looked like someone had already opened the bottle. Haven&#x27;t really seen any results either.</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling very clean. It was a little hard for me to lather but with a little extra water it works well. Smell is pleasant as well :)</li>
            <li> My hair was falling in chunks and I had tried every good shampoo in the market until I used Biotin. I&#x27;m glad that I chanced upon this product because my hair fall has reduced considerably and the quality is also improving. I would recommend the shampoo and conditioner together. The conditioner makes the hair not only feel thicker but also softer.</li>
            <li> I love the thickening shampoo.  It is wonderful and really has made a noticeable difference in my hair.  However, the conditioner is awful.  It doesn&#x27;t add moisture or detangle my hair at all.  In fact I feel like the conditioner dries out my hair even more after washing.  I use a different conditioner, but still use the shampoo because it is great.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair look greasy (but I have very fine hair). If I had thick hair, I&#x27;d probably love this :-)</li>
            <li> This conditioner not only seems watered down but it really doesnt do much for my hair either.  I have to use a trememdously large amount in order to get any type of actual conditioning feeling in my hair with this...literally 1/4-1/3 of a cup worth. This wouldnt be SO bad if i didnt have super fine and thin hair to begin with and its short so there should be no reason i should have to use this much conditioner.  I have used many different organic types of shampoo/conditioner and never have had to use this much.  I was really excited to get this conditioner but honestly it is not at all worth the money paid for it.  Very dissappointed</li>
            <li> 6/8/2013, first review: I thought to review this product as time goes on. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week, so I do not expect to see hair growth at this point.  It&#x27;s good to note that I&#x27;m 42 years old, w/disturbing hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottles are SMALL so I&#x27;m not using it carelessly. The smell is not flowery &amp; fun, but it&#x27;s more medicinal in scent, not overpowering. The shampoo lathers if you work at it, &amp; it&#x27;s a low lather rather than a high and luffy one. I rub it gently on my scalp &amp; throughout my hair. If scrub too hard, I&#x27;ll lose MORE HAIR. :( I am washing my hair every day, where I used to wash every other day. The conditioner does not lather.  It&#x27;s more of a cream that I rub gently onto wet hair. My hair feels sort of weighty as I wash it &amp; I think that I&#x27;m going to have a BAD HAIR DAY ahead of me, but after styling, it&#x27;s actually soft, manageable, not weighty! After washing, I wrap in a towel for about 5 minutes, apply FINESSE styling mousse, let my brown curls air dry. Sometimes a touch of hairspray but most days, not. With the thick feel in the shower, I am surprised that it&#x27;s not weighted down after styling. SO, I&#x27;ll keep on trying this for 3 months. I&#x27;ll try to remember to update if I see a difference. Feel free to ask me questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**IT&#x27;S IMPORTANT TO MENTION THAT ALONG W/THE SHAMPOO &amp; CONDITIONER, I&#x27;M TAKING, MAXI HAIR SUPPLEMENTS.  My Dr. was pleased w/the ingredients of the shamp, cond AND supplements. I use the supplements in place of a multi so I also take OMEGA 3 &amp; Calcium Citrate w/ D3. (As per Dr).**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6/27/2013 - Although there is NO new hair growth, I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;M LOSING LESS HAIR when I wash &amp; style!  It&#x27;s enough for me to notice &amp; enough for me to keep going w/ this trial. 19 days in, w/ consistent use of shamp/cond &amp; Maxi Hair, my hair is smoother, softer, shinier stronger, doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell, still not weighty &amp; continues to be manageable. I feel like whatever residue was clogging my hair is out. My hope is that this is the case for my scalp &amp; maybe, just maybe, I&#x27;ll see some new sprouts. A girl can dream. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6/30/2013 - Could it be?  New hair?  Will keep you posted.  I see three short hairs poking through!  I should also note that my nails need to be trimmed more often than ever, and I have to shave, (legs, underarms), more frequently!  I suspect this would be from the internal good I&#x27;m getting from the Maxi-Hair supplement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/21/2013 - YES!  Still losing less hair, AND there IS new hair growth in little stray spots.  My nails, which I keep short, need to be cut once every week to 10 days as opposed to once every 3 or more weeks!  I rcvd two complements on my hair this past week, about how shiny &amp;healthy it looks!  I remain faithful to the products, using them EVERY DAY as recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/21/13 - IMPORTANT UPDATE.  It seems that with months of use, this product is GREAT for clearing up any residue on my scalp, BUT it is drying out my hair.  I have to rotate my use of this and the conditioner.  It&#x27;s stripping the oils from my hair.  I will still use the shampoo and conditioner, but may just use it once a week.  WIll keep updating.  I did notice that for the past two weeks, when I use the products, my scalp gets just a little itchy.  That also indicates to me that the residue blocking my pores may be cleared up!  That is the good part!  SO, I will be using the MAXI HAIR daily as bottle recommends, but will limit the use of the shampoo and conditioner.y hope is that this is the case for my scalp &amp; maybe, just maybe, I&#x27;ll see some new sprouts.

            <li> I really like the Biotin B Complex Thickening Conditioner (and shampoo). I love the scent and I like the way my hair feels after I wash and condition my hair. Although I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice a change in volume and texture, ..I will continue to buy both products because I like the natural ingredients and wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner along with the shampoo, to stop my hair loss. My hair stopped falling off.  Good product.</li>
            <li> I am looking for volume because I already have thick hair.  I think this would work well on thinning hair.  It doesn&#x27;t feel like it cleans or softens real well but it definitely added some texture to my hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioner does magic! I love my hair after I&#x27;ve used it. It styles much better than before using it. The smell is great too!</li>
            <li> My hair appears and feels thicker. I like the fragrance too</li>
            <li> Feels like more hair.</li>
            <li> This and the accompanying shampoo are one of the few hair product lines that actually make my fine hair feel truly thick. I love it and my hair does not get &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; to it after a while. Smells good too.</li>
            <li> I have Protein issues therefore my hair these past couple of years have thinned (maybe too cuz I&#x27;m getting old)...but this conditioner used with their shampoo makes my hair feel thicker and healthier. I have long color treated hair and when using this product I find my hair is easy to manage after shampooing, no tangles. I not only recommend this product but I bought several bottles since my first purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW the price is not bad, since it takes a few drops to do the job, even with long hair. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for three months now. I have noticed a big difference in my hair. My hair is much thicker and has more body and volume.&lt;br /&gt;It feels much stronger. I see less hair in the comb and more on my head. I just reordered this product and will  continued to use it.</li>
