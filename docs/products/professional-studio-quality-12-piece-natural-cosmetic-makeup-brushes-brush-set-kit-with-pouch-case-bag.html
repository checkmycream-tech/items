            <li>They come in a nice case, and there is a web address to go and read about each brush&#x27;s function, which I thought was a nice additional touch.</li>

            <li>The roll keeps them nice and neat.</li>
            <li>The reason I didn&#x27;t give these brushes five stars is because the brushes doesnt have a label naming the kind of brush the customer is using.</li>
            <li>The case in which they come is handy, durable and portable.</li>
            <li>The handles are a bit longer than I like them, but maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m used to my own brushes.</li>

            <li>great product, quick delivery.</li>
            <li>but i will learn,all that for a super great price.</li>
            <li>I was very happy with this item, the brushes are good weight and the bristles aren&#x27;t like silk, but they&#x27;re nicer than anything you&#x27;d get at CVS or Walgreens for the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So if you want some really cheap- but nice make-up brushes then this is a good buy.</li>
            <li>They were a great value for the money and quick shipping.</li>
            <li>She was impressed that they were very soft and well made.</li>
            <li>The pouch that they came in had to go immediately thoughbecause of a very strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li>Very strong odor.</li>
            <li>The brushes and pouch have a very strong smell.</li>
            <li>They had a very strong smell when opened.</li>
            <li>Got them just 4 days after I purchased them, very strong chemical smell..</li>
            <li>The case has a very strong smell.</li>
            <li>However, when I opened the pouch to check out the brushes there is a very strong aroma of what I think is varnish.  </li>
            <li>However, I will say that the brushes and the pouch has a very strong chemical smell as others have stated.</li>
            <li>Immediately after opening the box I could smell a very strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very strong like alcohol type smell.</li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t very strong as a matter of fact</li>
            <li>Smells like very strong plastic.</li>
            <li>They are the best brushes I have had so far!</li>

            <li>and I am really pleased with the purchase.</li>

            <li>Love it, a bit of a smell</li>
            <li>You get so many brushes....</li>
            <li>I bought two sets of these brushes and love them.</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased them.  </li>
            <li>But once the smell passed, I have zero complaints :)</li>
            <li>Love the brush set.</li>
            <li>They are so soft its just amazing no scratchy feeling on skin just heavenly softness and the size is very nice too.</li>
            <li>They are good quality and just the right amount of each size for my makeup needs.</li>
            <li>The case is great as well to keep everything safe and new!</li>
            <li>but they appear to be beautiful brushes, very soft &amp; case</li>
            <li>My Fiancé said that they are very nice and spread makup very well for the price.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend !!!!!</li>
            <li>As a former Lancôme makeup artist, I love these brushes!!!</li>
            <li>I am very excited to try them out</li>
            <li>I think my niece will be very excited to receive these.</li>
            <li>I use it with higher end Mac or drug store brand makeup and it make the drugstore makeup look way more controlled and the Mac makeup looks over the top good with these brushes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear makeup that often, and when I did before I got this brush set, I was happy with what I could do; but now with this new set, I have been able to do a lot more with my eye makeup.</li>
            <li>She says they&#x27;re great and smooth on her skin and hold up really well!</li>
            <li>Pretty good product, though they shed more bristles during use than I would like.</li>
            <li>Decent quality for the price, however the brushes are shedding and don&#x27;t quite look great.</li>
            <li>Still, this is a great buy of a high quality product.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest these for those who want quality brushes for a great price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>high quality, no odor- great purchase.</li>
            <li>Also the case they come is is super cute!</li>
            <li>Amazing product and the price is right!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super soft on skin and are great for powder blending; have yet to try then on creams!</li>
            <li>Super nice for the cost :)</li>
            <li>Brushes are perfect, I just wish the case didn&#x27;t cause such a strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li>A pretty good product</li>
            <li>I have to say these brushes are pretty good quality for the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclaimer: I received a code to apply a full cost discount to this item, but this is my honest opinion on the product.</li>
            <li>these brushes are really soft and brushes on makeup evenly and quite beautifully.</li>
            <li>So I read the reviews before I bought these and had a pretty good idea of what they might be.</li>
            <li>They apply quite well (not my #1 but pretty good).</li>
            <li>Good quality and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Pretty good brushes, they do what theyre supposed to.</li>
            <li>At first, I loved this brush set.</li>
            <li>This is my first set of makeup brushes and they seem to be good quality.  </li>
            <li>I was going to rate this product 3 stars, but for the price it is a pretty good.</li>
            <li>But as I said before, for the price it is pretty good.</li>
            <li>These brushes surely are not the best quality, but for the price, they are WAY BETTER than I expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to wearing make-up, but I thought these brushes were great.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I thought the pouch it came with was super tacky</li>
            <li>The brushes seem okay, but there was an incredibly strong chemical smell when i opened the package.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on good brushes but at the same time I wanted to them to be good quality.</li>
            <li>They are good brushes, soft and nice quality bristles and handles.  </li>
            <li>, my make up apply much better, the brushes does not shed, which is the most important.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t comprehend how this product got so many good reviews...</li>
            <li>Great brushes, very soft.</li>
            <li>Great brushes, very soft and well made.</li>
            <li>Very professional feeling bristles and great price.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and they do a great job with application.  </li>
            <li>Very soft, great quality and they don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li>Their quality was incredible, loved the carrying case and they were delivered in less than 36 hours!</li>
            <li>This is a great bargain for these professional brushes with a case!  </li>
            <li>They was clean!</li>
            <li>Awesome brushes, they are super soft and I really enjoy them.</li>
            <li>Very good selection of different sizes and shapes.</li>
            <li>Very high quality, good value</li>
            <li>They are very good quality; soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>i bought this for a gift for a friend who is becoming a make up artist.</li>
            <li>For the price  and my first set of brushes I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>So far these brushes work great.  </li>
            <li>They are great quality and work just like the professional brushes in salons.</li>
            <li>I think these professional studio quality makeup brushes are great.  </li>
            <li>Happy so far with the product</li>
            <li>I love the carrying case and how light weight the brushes are.</li>
            <li>Now i dont necesarily use all of the brushes but the ones i do use are great and, just like the description says, soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I am sure my nieces will enjoy them for X-mas.</li>
            <li>The brushes themselves are soft and apply great.</li>
            <li>She was impressed by the wide selection of brushes.</li>
            <li>the longer handles allow a more secure grip.</li>
            <li>Seems like something that I will enjoy for many years.</li>
            <li>good product with high quality!</li>
            <li>For the price, you can&#x27;t beat them honestly, they&#x27;re well worth the $12 I paid.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used them much, but when I have I have loved them.</li>
            <li>These brushes would be good if they were fuller and didnt shed so much.</li>
            <li>Some brushes are good, others not so much.</li>
            <li>They loved them so much</li>
            <li>I have only used one of them so far, but the quality looks good, and the price is excellent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, for a person who has to use natural brushes it was a good buy, but, they could&#x27;a been better.</li>
            <li>The blend of the brushes make it as good as real hair.</li>
            <li>, we loved them so much</li>
            <li>When I took them out of the package they had a very strong chemical smell, but that dissipated quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy fast and really good pricing</li>
            <li>Great brushes, very soft and precise.</li>
            <li>As a makeup artist I own a ton of brushes, this Karity Cosmetics set is right up there with Sigma and Mac.</li>
            <li>The makeup case is very plastic-y but pretty good for storing the brushes on the go!</li>
            <li>Very nice complete make-up pieces.</li>
            <li>As long as you keep them clean they apply makeup beautifully !</li>
            <li>But other than that, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I just used the brushes for the first time this morning, but I already love them!  </li>
            <li>Other than that all of the brushes are great!</li>
            <li>Pretty good quality bristle wise but the handles separate far too easily</li>
            <li>Her make up goes on easily using them</li>
            <li>Great price for how many different brushes come in the set, however, you get what you pay for...</li>
            <li>I received them very quick.</li>
            <li>Great set for someone like me who doesn&#x27;t need so many different types of eyeshadow brushes.</li>
            <li>The packaging rolls up for easy storage.</li>
            <li>Also, I have found that some of the smaller ones work great if you are using with some sort of cream type cosmetic, cream eye shadow, cream contour, concealer, etc., but require a lot more application with a powder cosmetic to get the desired color.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t know what brushes are for you can easily find on their website.</li>
            <li>One of the brushes came with some glue on the tip, which I couldn&#x27;t remove easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply makeup</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly.</li>

            <li>The case is nice and not to big and good for traveling.</li>
            <li>You have to air it out the plastic smell is so strong</li>

            <li>However, the brushes have a strong odor.</li>
            <li>Does have a strong smell of plastic, however.  </li>
            <li>Good quality, nice sized brushes overall...</li>

            <li>The brush kit looks great and I will be excited to try it out this week as I have a busy week that will need lots of &amp;#34;glam&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The color seems a lot more true</li>
            <li>This is the first brush kit I have purchased, so I don&#x27;t have a lot to compare it to to be completely honest.</li>
            <li>i liked at first but then started to shed.</li>
            <li>I am using this kind of thing first time.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>Love the cool case they come in.</li>
            <li>I really liked them when I first got them.</li>
            <li>I have been using the set about 6 months and they are still good as new.</li>
            <li>I bought one in black, and purple for my best friend.</li>
            <li>Just wash your brushes like always before using them and it will be just fine.</li>
            <li>But, they work just fine.</li>
            <li>The product is fine.</li>
            <li>The brushes were fine</li>
            <li>These brushes are just &amp;#34;Okay&amp;#34; But they often &amp;#34;shed&amp;#34; or pieces of the bristles break off while applying my foundation, they work fine, but I would not purchase these again.  </li>
            <li>I think for the price point these will work fine</li>
            <li>Only best recommendations;-)</li>
            <li>The smell has dissipated and is fine now.</li>
            <li>but it works fine with powders, I would buy again</li>
            <li>And i&#x27;m pretty sure the bristles aren&#x27;t authentic.</li>
            <li>Product was just as promised and was shipped in fine time.</li>
            <li>Have been using them for 3 months now and holding up just fine.</li>
            <li>A quick wash got rid of the smell!</li>
            <li>then that brush are very soft and good quality</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very soft, the bristles do not fall out and they feel good against your face.</li>
            <li>Good quality for the price and very soft.</li>
            <li>Item in good shape and very complete with all these brushes.</li>
            <li>Exceptional, high quality.</li>
            <li>They are absolutely everything &amp; more !</li>

            <li>Wife absolutely loved brushes and they got here super fast</li>
            <li>Beautiful brushes even better then expected!</li>
            <li>When I first received them, the case had a very strong odor (like paint fumes), but after I let it air or in my garage overnight, the smell had gone.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;there is a very strong odor at first when opened</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very strong at first and made me feel like I was in an auto body shop.</li>
            <li>huge chunks just fell out of it.</li>

            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>they are really good quality and they are soft.</li>

            <li>The brushes and bag had an overwhelmingly strong chemical/plastic smell when I first opened the package, and most of that has faded but it hasn&#x27;t gone away.</li>

            <li>Obviously not designer brushes at this price, but honestly they do a pretty good job.</li>
            <li>Easy for organizing and quick travels.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, good packaging, were exactly as described.</li>
            <li>The brushes themselves are natural hair, super soft, and blend flawlessly.</li>
            <li>I bought it based on the good reviews and really regret it when I received the product since there is strong smell that really made me dizzy and wanted to throw up.  </li>
            <li>The handles are nice and long that the brush blends the makeup nicely.</li>
            <li>I really like the quality of the brushes, the bristles do not flake off and makes applying my cosmetics very easy.</li>

            <li>I thought they looked like a great set of makeup brushes and I will probably buy a set for myself later on, as my own are getting old.  </li>
            <li>this is so good with make up and barely falls out.</li>
            <li>Although, I&#x27;ve not had a chance to test them for long, they appear to be a great investment for anyone was trying to expand their brush collection or travel a lot.</li>
            <li>I will update this after some use, but if you are on the fence, the brush holder alone is probably worth the price!</li>
            <li>I love the fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Such a great price and my brushes are soft and amazing.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it!</li>

            <li>So worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>Really great quality for such a reasonable price!!</li>
            <li>Based on good reviews, I had high hopes for these brushes as an inexpensive alternative to higher end brands.</li>

            <li>I took the cover off each one of them and rubbed them on the palm of my hand to take the dust that makes it smell, then clean them with a wipe to take  off the excess.</li>
            <li>#34;Amazon order needs your attention.&amp;#34;  Every time I clicked to find a message saying, &amp;#34;Please! - We Really need some good reviews on these brushes!&amp;#34; Very tacky.</li>
            <li>I  went through many reviews to find good brushes that wouldn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg and had minimal shedding.</li>

            <li>Very soft brushes in a nice case.</li>

            <li>I rarely experienced having to deal with loose bristles on my face.</li>
            <li>and they are very nice quality, soft brushes for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>The brushes themselves aren&#x27;t anything special but work</li>
            <li>For me, there is one too many large brushes.</li>

            <li>They are amazing I have used them frequently</li>
            <li>This is true, and mostly smells like the leather pouch that it came in was straight from a paint factory.</li>
            <li>Looks professional and the materials are nice.</li>
            <li>The brushes are well made with even build nice soft tapered tips.</li>
            <li>Purchased for my teenage granddaughter she loved the brushes.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 13 year old daughter, and she is thrilled with all the brushes.</li>
            <li>If looking for something good and affordable then look no further.</li>
            <li>I would not purchase the full set again.</li>
            <li>Love how fast this shipped</li>
            <li>/&gt;Additionally, the size differences between the brushes aren&#x27;t true to the display picture.</li>

            <li>I got these brushed because the good reviews</li>

            <li>Nice soft bristles.</li>

            <li>Good purchase overall</li>
            <li>The bag was nice and soft, but I have no need.  </li>
            <li>They pick up a good amount of product so you don&#x27;t constantly have to be redipping your brush.</li>
            <li>And if you can spend some more, real techniques are the holy grail.</li>
            <li>Relatively to the price, I got a good quality set of brushes.</li>

            <li>For the price it&#x27;s a great deal in terms of options for different brushes; was just surprised given that, that I still found myself needing 1 or 2 types that weren&#x27;t there...think it has to do more with the quality.</li>

            <li>Not bad for this price.</li>
            <li>Very excited about the fan brush in particular!</li>
            <li>Super soft and really nice.</li>
            <li>I love the texture of the natural bristles, the quality is high-end, they are easy</li>
            <li>The brush selection is great, and they have a very soft, professional feel.  </li>
            <li>When i first recieved it, it had strong scent</li>
            <li>case does have a strong smell at first.</li>
            <li>The pouch had a strong \\&quot;factory acetone like\\&quot; odor to it at first, but it eventually faded.</li>
            <li>the case smells strongly of vinyl and it&#x27;s pretty bulky.</li>
            <li>Pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li>Also on the lip lining brush, you can tell it&#x27;s going to fray pretty easily.</li>
            <li>Firstly, the smell of the case is quite strong.</li>
            <li>Also, when I first opened the package, there was a strong &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34; smell emitting from the brush case.</li>
            <li>Other than that great brushes.</li>
            <li>Other than that they are great and within my price range.</li>
            <li>the carry case is great for traveling and fits other brushes</li>
            <li>Other than that, I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>When they are cleaned bristles do not fall out, a problem I&#x27;ve experienced with other brands.</li>
            <li>Nice brush kit in handy little wrap type case.</li>
            <li>I love my new make up brushes!</li>
            <li>I love my new brushes!  </li>
            <li>They got here really quick too.</li>
            <li>but overall I was very impressed with the quality especially for the price!!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how to use so many different brushes or what all are suppose to be used for :)   </li>
            <li>I could not be more pleased especially with the texture and price.</li>
            <li>I would buy these again because they seem to be made very well and don&#x27;t look cheap or wear cheap at all.</li>
            <li>I was lucky to come across it when I did.</li>
            <li>Received product quickly.</li>
            <li>This was a gift and was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>Work very well and easy to clean,</li>
            <li>I unrolled and removes the plastic packaging and the odor was gone quickly.</li>
            <li>The big blush brush has worked excellently in evenly applying brush to all the desired facial regions with no spotting, blotching or streaking.</li>
            <li>Product got here super quick.</li>
            <li>Variety of tips are probably more than needed (for most), but offer the opportunity to experiment with different shading styles.</li>
            <li>They came quickly.</li>
            <li>I was super exited for them but</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>We love the brushes definitely will buy more .</li>
            <li>Like headache worthy smell.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice if each brush was labeled to indicate intended use, but that&#x27;s not a big deal and the website provides detailed explanation</li>
            <li>I just now washed them carefully in a mild shampoo bath and they are drying.</li>
            <li>Luckily, it went away soon.</li>
            <li>I am excited to finally have a full set of brushes to call my own.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These are high quality brushes and i love the way they feel.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;leather&amp;#34; case is adorable and seems to be high quality.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend and would consider purchasing more for gifts.</li>
            <li>she has had many high end makup brushes.</li>
            <li>Better off buying a high quality brush at sephora or Mac.</li>
            <li>Love my brushes and certainly will be buying these a gifts for makeup loving friends in the future.</li>
            <li>Love the fan brush and case :) I&#x27;m fairly new to makeup but seems decent.</li>
            <li>but overall very satisfied.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very useful, I like it very much</li>
            <li>I use Bare Minerals makeup and although they have nice brushes too they seem to need to be cleaned a lot.</li>
            <li>First, the case is so unbelievably cheap looking.</li>
            <li>I decided to purchase this brush set after reading several reviews from others who were very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Loved the carrying case, however I felt the handle of the brushes were a bit too long, which I was not a fan of.</li>
            <li>The bag isn&#x27;t extremely large so it makes it easy to pack for trips.</li>
            <li>Super duper fast!!</li>
            <li>welcome gives some brief indications of what the different types of brush are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the most useful brushes in the make up</li>
            <li>Love my new brushes.</li>
            <li>Very professional spa style brushes!!!!.</li>
            <li>The smaller in the set work pretty good.</li>
            <li>Brushes pick up product easily yet deposit on the skin in a very controlled manned.</li>
            <li>My price point at the time didn&#x27;t include any higher quality brushes, and I really wish I had just saved up more.</li>
            <li>Most of it seemed to come from the plastic wrapping, so once I got rid of that it was better but not completely eliminated.</li>
            <li>It really smelled strongly of some chemical order.</li>
            <li>But other than that, amazing quality!</li>
            <li>But overall, I absolutely love them for the value!</li>
            <li>Exactly what we needed!</li>
            <li>They are exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>I love every one of these professional makeup brushes!</li>
            <li>Definitely don&#x27;t need more brushes than this!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was expecting !</li>
            <li>I like these brushes and it comes with a good variety, but one of the brush heads  is loose</li>
            <li>I would most definitely give them a strong 5 stars if not for the smell.</li>
            <li>I love the convenient of the pouch case bag, taking it anywhere with you, and all the brushes was super soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>Since my skin is very sensitive, I am delighted that bristles are extremely soft.</li>
            <li>For me, I just needed a few more new inexpensive brushes for the time being, and its a great set for that and especailly travel.</li>
            <li>easy to clean and super soft.</li>
            <li>The foundation brush doesn&#x27;t work very well but the rest of them are fine.</li>
            <li>They are super soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>all the brushes are so useful and everything blends really well together with the brush!!</li>
            <li>These brushes are fantastic and very high quality.</li>
            <li>I rate this product overall an A+ for its ease of use, sophisticated design and large array of brushes which I haven&#x27;t been able to find elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>twelve brushes contained within the roll are all very well finished and balanced with full-size handles that are comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;There are no instructions with the brushes but logging on to KarityCosmetics.com</li>
            <li>These brushes are amazing, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>Great set and price, I use this set everyday that I wear makeup.</li>
            <li>Overall i think they were an amazing deal.</li>
            <li>These brushes feel amazing soft and they hold product very well.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money</li>
            <li>good product came faster than expected</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I looked on the website and its worth 85$...</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews</li>
            <li>She says it was worth 5 stars.</li>
            <li>For the money, it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>This brush set definitely worth the price</li>
            <li>They are definitely worth the buying.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and durable and I swear my make-up looks better just from using them.</li>
            <li>They come in a nice bag you can use for storing or toting around, if necessary.</li>
            <li>My daughter says that it&#x27;s pretty cool.</li>
            <li>I bought them as a gift but was able to feel how soft they were.</li>
            <li>definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li>So nice but the only thing I didn&#x27;t get was a foundation brush</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and hold shadow well - face, powder and foundation brushes are on par with items costing 4x or more</li>
            <li>Overall really nice brushes for the price.</li>
            <li>Gives my make up look more professional polished finish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just starting to get into more complex make-up routines and these have been a wonderful start.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it for a beginners brush kit.</li>
            <li>I feel like they make my makeup that much more natural looking.</li>
            <li>It is worth buying.</li>
            <li>Love the pouches, soft brushes.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny .</li>
            <li>Brushes were cheap, pouch was nothing more than plastic and the entire set had a funky odor, so I returned it.</li>
            <li>She was beyond thrilled and said the only problem was that she didn&#x27;t know what all the brushes were used for.  </li>
            <li>They come in a handy roll up leather like pouch; very convenient for taking with you for the weekend, they are soft and the bristles seem to be well attached.  </li>
            <li>Now, they&#x27;re a handy kit that I pull out when I&#x27;m feeling like doing some proper, fancy make-up.</li>
            <li>I love these soft brushes and recommend them to everyone.  </li>
            <li>Brushes are nice, but I wish they were labeled as to each brushes specific function.  </li>
            <li>I simply threw away the pouch since I had bought a nice makeup holder anyway.</li>
            <li>Im very happy with this set was definitely money well spent</li>
            <li>All in all, these are s***y brushes, not even worth playing with the dolls.</li>
            <li>They work good and there was a wide variety of brushes to use</li>
            <li>So far I love the brushes.</li>
            <li>In my option well worth the money.</li>
            <li>but it has a distinct odor I have not use it yet and have not wash yet</li>
            <li>Worth the price I paid.</li>
            <li>They have the kind of quality that I believe would last a while.</li>
            <li>While I have so many reservations about purchasing &#x27;natural&#x27; brushes, I couldn&#x27;t pass up on the deal.</li>
            <li>They are soft and I absolutely love.</li>
            <li>The only thing I liked is the brush holder.</li>
            <li>I really love this brushes they were more than what I expected.</li>
            <li>I love the selection and the brushes are soft.</li>
            <li>I love the natural brushes.</li>
            <li>Natural hair, which I find is so much better than synthetic.  </li>
            <li>Very good set for an unbelievable price!  </li>
            <li>When i first opened the package, I immediately smelled a strong chemical odor, like when you paint or like a really concentrated sharpie, so I took the brushes out of the case and put the case in my closet for a couple of days and the smell was gone.</li>
            <li>First of all, these really do smell quite strong</li>
            <li>/&gt;In conclusion, if you are looking for decent brushes that will get the job done, these will do just fine.</li>
            <li>Loved the brushes quality for such a great price who needs to spend $20 per brush or more these work just the same if not better.</li>
            <li>They came pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, from my experience thus far - this set is a decent deal price-wise, but it isn&#x27;t anything amazing.</li>
            <li>So not only are you getting a high quality product but your also getting a really good deal.  </li>
            <li>You guys know the pouch is probably made from puppies they hit over the head or cut their throats so they can skin them and make this product right?</li>
            <li>These arrived right on time (two day shipping).</li>
            <li>Shipped right away and with everything stated in description.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve finally found a winner- they haven&#x27;t shedded, they blend nicely, and they&#x27;re a good quality overall (so far)!</li>
            <li>This is my first set of professional makeup brushes and I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li>very soft and easy to work with.</li>
            <li>The only con about them is they came in a leather pouch that smelled very strongly of chemicals and plastic.</li>
            <li>The only issue I had was the bag they are stored in had a very strong plastic/chemical smell when we opened it.</li>
            <li>One reviewer said there was a smell, I experienced very little smell.  </li>
            <li>but I did not like the many, many e-mails that I received from the seller after the purchase with the subject, &amp;</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE the shadow brushes, which was my main reason for purchasing this particular set.</li>
            <li>I tried one brush and it applied smoothly and quickly - 100000x better than applicators that usually come free with make-up purchases.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are natural and the makeup goes on nice a smooth, the bristles have not fallen out even with extensive use.</li>
            <li>However, my first impression is that they were worth the price</li>
            <li>There has been no shedding as I&#x27;ve experienced with some brushes in the past.</li>
            <li>I would have to recommend these brushes to anyone who is looking into an affordable brush set that would also meet the expectations of any amateur or moderately experienced makeup user.</li>
            <li>other than that minor flaw its the best brush set I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>I considered giving 4 stars because the brushes are too long for my travel makeup bag, but since they come with their own travel case I haven&#x27;t found that to be an inconvenience.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty nice brushes for being so cheap I paid nearly 50 dollars for another set of brushed</li>
            <li>Wonderful for both theatrical and everyday use.</li>
            <li>These brushes are great for such a low price!</li>
            <li>U really don&#x27;t need more than these 12 brushes unless u r a professional makeup artist.</li>
            <li>Brushes are soft &amp; easy to work with.</li>
            <li>i am not big on makeup and am definitely no makeup artist, so these brushes work great for me.</li>
            <li>The pouch does have a strong smell of paint but aired out overnight.  </li>
            <li>Soft bristles and picks up product easily.</li>
            <li>I really only bought these for two specific brushes but all of them are great.</li>
            <li>just as described and shipped super fast thank you..</li>
            <li>Great quality especially for the low price I purchased them.</li>
            <li>Eye shadow brushes make application easy and professional looking.</li>
            <li>Since it comes with so many, I&#x27;ll just start using another brush, but if you&#x27;re a makeup pro, you might want to spend a little more for higher quality.</li>
            <li>I love this brush set and its so unbelievably cheap for such high quality.</li>
            <li>While they are very soft and provide smooth application, they also shed quite a bit.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy how soft these brushes are!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t know what to expect especially for so cheap, best brushes, I&#x27;ve used ever, now I wish I had gotten the bigger 32 brush set, my bare minerals brushes were not as nice as these, now I wonder if karity makes a kabuki brush, and BTW you just can&#x27;t beat bare minerals foundation matte ,actually i sleep in it!</li>
            <li>Item exactly as described - Super Fast Shipping</li>
            <li>I like these brushes very much.</li>
            <li>I like these brushes very much.</li>
            <li>So far These brushes are working fine</li>
            <li>Pretty great variety of decent brushes for little $</li>
            <li>Good for the price, but now the little bristles are coming off onto my face everytime</li>
            <li>Good product with little to no shedding.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and pretty!</li>
            <li>Comes in a pleather package, very sleek and modern!!</li>
            <li>She has been asking for new brushes and I was excited to find these.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The natural brush is the way to go because they hold more product &amp; the blending brush adds the professional touch!!</li>
            <li>When I first used them they shed a bit</li>
            <li>The brushes work pretty well for a beginner</li>
            <li>I will add to my review when I&#x27;ve had the chance to use them and given them their first cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My favorite part of these brushes are the smaller eyeshadow brushes, I found that some of my eyeshadows that don&#x27;t seem to go on with a lot of pigment seem renewed using these brushes.</li>
            <li>However, she likes the set so much, she is keeping them for herself!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was wanting.</li>
            <li>first time user of make up after taking make up</li>
            <li>My rating would have been higher</li>
            <li>So, the first time I washed these brushes after getting them, they bled a reddish color.</li>
            <li>First time user of make up and brushes are sufficient</li>
            <li>and I do still enjoy how soft they are.</li>
            <li>These brushes from a first impression remind me of the Morphe brushes.</li>
            <li>I love the eye brushes though I use them daily</li>
            <li>I think they will last more than a year.</li>
            <li>but they are better than you would get than from buying brushes from walmart at the same price.</li>
            <li>This is my first set of brushes that I bought all together instead of buying one here and one there.</li>
            <li>and I love all the different size options!  </li>
            <li>Truthfully, I only purchased this set because I wanted more brushes for applying eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>First brush set ever.</li>
            <li>but like I said, I don&#x27;t do make up often and don&#x27;t exactly know what I&#x27;m doing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly as depicted in the offering</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t going anywhere, just decided to try to use as many of the brushes as possible for the review.wasn&#x27;t going anywhere, just decided to try to use as many of the brushes as possible for the review.</li>
            <li>When they first were taken out of the box it smelled like they spray painted the case.</li>
            <li>It does more than enough for me</li>
            <li>I will provide more feedback later.</li>
            <li>this is my first set of makeup brushes</li>
            <li>They are exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>We used them right after we bought them for a large wedding party.  </li>
            <li>The bag for the brushes looks pretty.</li>
            <li>This was my first purchase from Karity and they didn&#x27;t disappoint.  </li>
            <li>There was a smell when they first arrived, but after a couple of days the smell dissipated.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend !!</li>
            <li>The larger brushes were more flexible than I like, and the fan brush had to be flatironed after washing.</li>
            <li>that said the brushes had a funny smell to it</li>
            <li>They look exactly like the picture</li>
            <li>I would most definitely recommend these brushes to anyone looking for makeup application!  </li>
            <li>My first brush set</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price but took a chance and was blown away by what came in the mail!</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to purchase makeup brushes :)</li>
            <li>Maybe now I can take up painting on the side ;)</li>
            <li>It came with more brushes than she can actually use.</li>
            <li>The brushes were exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>On a side note, the case they came in was pretty chemical smelling</li>
            <li>This is my first time using makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with any type of makeup brush.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a wide variety of brushes for all your needs, and they look pretty nice, too.</li>
            <li>The defining brushes work better &amp; apply makeup well enough.</li>
            <li>Exactly was was advertised.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s pretty picky about brushes.</li>
            <li>Very Niceeeee!</li>
            <li>Thanks u!</li>
            <li>First, let me say...</li>
            <li>Not expensive</li>
            <li>Pretty brushes.  </li>
            <li>Also they have an overwhelming chemical smell when you first open the bag,</li>
            <li>I only wish it came with more eyeshadow blending brushes...</li>
            <li>This was my first purchase on Amazon</li>
            <li>The bag smells funny.</li>
            <li>Love it especially the price!</li>
            <li>Just be aware of the smell.</li>
            <li>I put mine in a pretty glass container and threw away the bag.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I was able to purchase this set as a back up set</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>My daughter likes them so much she bought them for her friend!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a brush for absolutely everything!</li>
            <li>I love them especially for the price.</li>
            <li>This set of brushes would have been okay for the price if the brushes didn&#x27;t have such an odor - the odor had petroleum based  smell which may have been from the case - but even after washing the brushes retained that odor and made me unwilling to use them on my face.</li>
            <li>The lack of softness is more noticeable on the big brushes.</li>
            <li>I would be willing to try them again.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first because of the price but these brushes are perfect !!!</li>
            <li>and i definitely recommend. :)</li>
            <li>and so it slid out within first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I really like these brushes!</li>
            <li>She said that she was glad that the brushes had individual sleeves inside of the carrying case to preserve their shapes.</li>
            <li>these bushes are much higher in price.  </li>
            <li>Even make up artist they ship fast and work just as great as the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>I love the travel case and the fact that the bigger brushes come with plastic protectors for travel.</li>
            <li>Amazon sells much better quality brushes for the same price.</li>
            <li>These were the first makeup brushes ihave ever purchased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again :)</li>
            <li>The quality its exactly what i am looking for.</li>
            <li>The hair came out a lot my first couple times using them.  </li>
            <li>As another reviewer noted, the case had an odor when I first opened it.  </li>
            <li>Wash brushes &amp; air out case when you first get it.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves the brushes!  </li>
            <li>I really like these brushes!</li>
            <li>Thanks for meeting my expectations!</li>
            <li>Well, I can tell you exactly what these smell like- spray paint.</li>
            <li>The smell alone was enough to deter me from touching these brushes to my face.</li>
            <li>She loved the brushes and has been using them everyday since she got them.</li>
            <li>Bought these because of the good reviews and the few that said the names of the brushes were on the handles...</li>
            <li>other wise a decent value.</li>
            <li>They arrived with minimal packaging but the brush roll itself is lovely - a very attractive black and white pleather roll featuring the Karity logo with well-attached security</li>
            <li>these brushes blend good when half of their hair isnt falling off!</li>
            <li>About the smell, they really have a strong chemical smell, but I took them out the case and plastic and it seems worked so far.</li>
            <li>people will probably already own an extra large Kabuki powder brush in their battery of brushes, the long - handled one here is a good size, whilst not the same as a Kabuki it still gives generous coverage.</li>
            <li>I was very much looking forward to receiving these brushes, counting on the overwhelmingly positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Absolutely reek of chemicals right out package....</li>
            <li>unless you come up close you can&#x27;t even smell it and it&#x27;ll probably go away over some time but other than that its amazing.</li>
            <li>These brushes are great and soft and definitely worth the price :) I&#x27;ve used them everyday for a few weeks now and no problems so far :)</li>
            <li>She has since thrown out all her other brushes and is loving this set.</li>
            <li>I would compare them to some other Sephora brushes I own.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the second set of brushes I&#x27;ve used, the first being a Kirkland brand set (much softer; much more durable).</li>
            <li>Other than that the eyeshadow brushes are effective.</li>
            <li>The price was well worth it; the value was over $80 on the website fit the exact same product</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not a professional makeup artist these brushes will do just fine!</li>
            <li>I was shocked at the price and honestly did not expect it to be great</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty long from top to bottom, if that matters.  </li>
            <li>They smelled a little plastic-y from the brush holder, but other then that these are actually great!</li>
            <li>Super soft!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t lose bristles, and the brushes are super soft!</li>
            <li>Brushes are super soft!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super soft and work really well!</li>
            <li>They do have a strong smell when you open them for the first time, but the smell went away as soon as I washed them.</li>
            <li>the natural hair brushes are super soft!!!!</li>
            <li>It was also delivered pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Great for an amateur makeup artist or a professional!</li>
            <li>just strange. :)</li>
            <li>Smell at first, but that went away fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I got what I paid for pretty much.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and full.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these brushes to anyone &amp; the price is right</li>
            <li>I washed them with my brush cleaning solution and wiped down the pouch it came in (which is nice pleather-ish material) and the smell went away.</li>
            <li>Though I have had only brief opportunity to make use of the brush set, the Karity Professional set appears to be excellent quality, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>I will most definitely be ordering more brushes again on the near future.</li>
            <li>They work well, are soft and clean nicely in warm water with a little soap.  </li>
            <li>Very strong smell as other reviewers noted but</li>
            <li>Some of the smaller brushes have strong yet supple qualities which make them ideal for applying more delicate and intricate forms of makeup in a non irritating, precise fashion.</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous about ordering them online but was so pleased once she received them!</li>
            <li>I really love the qualoyy of the brushes they are also very long</li>
            <li>These brushes are super soft and apply makeup well</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy enough to get used to.</li>
            <li>The folding case is fabulous, I&#x27;ve pretty much only used the eyebrow/eyelash brush, the eyeshadow brush and the angled contouring brush.</li>
            <li>bristles are super soft and no shedding!&lt;br /&gt;The pouch does have an odor</li>
            <li>super soft bristles even though they look hoarse</li>
            <li>They do not shed when using and are super soft.</li>
            <li>Others begin to lose hair rather quickly, but these have stood up well so far.</li>
            <li>Super soft.</li>
            <li>I ended up sending them back because it was too strong to give as a gift to my mother in law.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that the case does have a strong smell to it</li>
            <li>The length precludes me from carrying any of these around in my daily arsenal of tricks, BUT for fancy nights the length is a good thing since you are supposed to use long brushes, holding them from the furthest point to keep from over applying</li>
            <li>I received the brushes today and As I ripped the envelope they were mailed in, I got a sudden wiff of a strong odor.</li>
            <li>The only thing that bothered me was the strong smell.</li>
            <li>I dont think I have used a single one more than once.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are large and sturdy.  </li>
            <li>Been using them for a few weeks now and absolutely love them!</li>
            <li>I love my new brush set definitely recommend !</li>
            <li>I figured for the price I would give them a try since my old set was pretty pricey and not in my budget right now.</li>
            <li>They seem to have a nice tight hold on the bristles themselves.</li>
            <li>High quality for very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>the face brushes aren&#x27;t my favorite, they&#x27;re constantly shedding and they aren&#x27;t very soft.</li>
            <li>The smaller brushes ate fine.</li>
            <li>I left it close to a window to get some air and after a day or two, it was fine.</li>
            <li>The brush handles look like they&#x27;re made of some pretty decent quality and</li>
            <li>These brushes seem to be pretty decent quality</li>
            <li>Very high quality.</li>
            <li>These were very high quality for the price.  </li>
            <li>Very high quality.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to do my makeup one single time without finding bristles stuck to my face!</li>
            <li>The largest one is just not stiff enough to really apply powder very well; I wish it was just a tad bit better.</li>
            <li>and I really like them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li>So much more than I expected for the cost.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast too.</li>
            <li>and she seems to really like them.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>&#x60;I know absolutely nothing about makeup and the act of applying it</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and item as described.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>I bought them for my daughter and she really enjoys them.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use the lash/brow comb, I prefer a spoolie for my brows &amp; my Tweezerman lash comb for lashes, so I can&#x27;t comment on that.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast and my niece loves them.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much experience with makeup brushes</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I like these brushes a lot as they blend my makeup very well, without it looking caked on.</li>
            <li>I really like these brushes.  </li>
            <li>but for its price , theyre better than expected .</li>
            <li>They arrived fast.  </li>
            <li>I really like how the brushes apply my makeup</li>
            <li>the brushes had to be cleaned very well and one came apart while cleaning...</li>
            <li>I was not expecting much because of the price</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this set!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear makeup very often</li>
            <li>Was given as a gift to my daughter and she absolutely loves them.</li>
            <li>really looking forward to pampering myself.</li>
            <li>I apologize that the light and angle weren&#x27;t the same (that damn sun keeps moving!!!)</li>
            <li>Alas it&#x27;s not that great of a product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Get what you pay for really.</li>
            <li>And I really like the pouch.</li>
            <li>They do not work very well.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush set for my roommate for Christmas because she needed a set, and she absolutely loves them.</li>
            <li>They work very well for applying makeup.  </li>
            <li>i really like these brushes for the price</li>
            <li>Really like the set.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the leather smell doesn&#x27;t bother me too much</li>
            <li>and I actually really like the case</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Much better quality than expected for this price.</li>
            <li>they are better than I expected</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like these Brushes.</li>
            <li>She absolutely LOVES them.</li>
            <li>These brushes were so much nicer than the picture.</li>
            <li>Cleaning with a mixture of dish soap and olive oil works really well, it doesn&#x27;t make them lose additional bristles.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>but these brushes are very hit and miss.</li>
            <li>They shed after about three washes and they applied everything that was powder very patchy.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Item(s) arrived fast and as described.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really pick up these brushes as much as I would like.</li>
            <li>so much</li>
            <li>The bristles stay in the brush and are gentle to use.</li>
            <li>They work very well</li>
            <li>but I really like it.</li>
            <li>case is convenient to have but very stinky plastic.</li>
            <li>I really like the brushes, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say much as to how they stand up over time.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I would like to add two thumbs up for fast shipping.</li>
            <li>and I really like the eyeshadow</li>
            <li>mind much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;they are very soft,&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li>its very nice&lt;br /&gt;i can recommend it all my friends whose using make ups ,&lt;br /&gt;its 100% satisfaction guarantee,some brush that i have been use its make me itch,but this one is really make me feel so comptable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The brushes work very well.</li>
            <li>I really have the concern</li>
            <li>I really like the fan brush and the blush brushes.</li>
            <li>and I ordered myself a set given the reasonable price.</li>
            <li>This was a Christmas gift for my daughter and she absolutely loves them.</li>
            <li>Better then expected when I opened the box.</li>
            <li>Amazon should really invest in it considering some of the products they endorse.</li>
            <li>These brushes should cost three times as much.  </li>
            <li>I really like them.</li>
            <li>I really like these brushes</li>
            <li>I like the fact that the brushes grab the power really well.</li>
            <li>Purchased as a gift for my daughter, she really likes them.</li>
            <li>Wife really loves these and was amazed at the price</li>
            <li>so this kit really comes in</li>
            <li>I really like the brushes</li>
            <li>in all Im very</li>
            <li>This was given as a gift and was very well received.  </li>
            <li>More than I expected.  </li>
            <li>They are not plastic, they are real wood.  </li>
            <li>The case wasn&#x27;t real leather.</li>
            <li>Real hair.</li>
            <li>I really like these brushes and the case it comes in.  </li>
            <li>I really like this set.</li>
            <li>And not so much to hinder my application, just a nuisance if anything.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have everything you&#x27;ll want, and the quality is better than expected for the price.</li>
            <li>I really like these brushes.</li>
            <li>should anyone really need that</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive for what you get.</li>
            <li>set.&lt;br /&gt;The carrying wrap bag is a plus and very convenient.</li>
            <li>This set is fantastic for personal use.</li>
            <li>For the price, you get what you need, plus a better quality than expected.</li>
            <li>Not to mention their fast delivery</li>
            <li>They work really well</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, as well.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these brushes!</li>
            <li>and she absolutely lives them.</li>
            <li>Of course I did not wash them, but I can&#x27;t imagine that washing them would change much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m giving this product three stars instead of two because the smaller brushes work as expected and the price of the set is good for what you get.</li>
            <li>For the same price,in a department store, you only have five medium quality brushes,i hesitated,went home to Amazon,and of course i found a pouch of 12 fines,well organized soft,good quality brushes,to apply all kind of make up,some of them i don&#x27;t even know,how to use them</li>
            <li>when i recieved the brush i immediately check attachment of the brush to its wooden handle, because as what i&#x27;ve read about the reviews most of the comment was the brush is not firmly attached to the handle.</li>
            <li>I am not a makeup artist, but I do like nice brushes - they make such a difference especially for eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li>It goes away after a few days, but it&#x27;s pretty strong when you first get them!</li>
            <li>As a previous reviewer said, they had a VERY STRONG CHEMICAL SMELL when I got them in the mail.</li>
            <li>I would have liked a more firm powder brush, but for this price I&#x27;m certainly not complaining.</li>
            <li>These brushes are truly professional!!!</li>
            <li>Very rarely do you get quality at a low price.  </li>
            <li>My other professional brushes are far superior.</li>
            <li>These are quality brushes that have held up very nicely for the last few months.</li>
            <li>If you like the hairs on the brush to be very thin and light this will be good for you.</li>
            <li>The smell of the cases were a little strong but went away quickly after opening (leathery smell; not offensive).</li>
            <li>They are easy to work with because they are long.</li>
            <li>I was told the eye brushes were decent but the bigger brushes were cheap.</li>
            <li>Nice variety of brushes, large and small.  </li>
            <li>The different eye make - up brushes enable unique designs.</li>
            <li>It is okay except some brushes were made with other materials.</li>
            <li>I will purchase a better quality foundation brush and continue to use the other brushes in the kit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a set that I would use while saving money for a higher end set or individual brushes of better quality such as from the MAC line.</li>
            <li>This is better than I expected!</li>
            <li>Having NO CLUE in the WORLD what to look for in a makeup brush, of course I asked my daughter and gave her several (what appeared to be high quality) sets available here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>They are high quality and much better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I figured it out on my own, but an small instruction book would have been appreciated.</li>
            <li>My daily routine doesn&#x27;t much involve brushes, but I decided to get a full brush kit.</li>
            <li>They have a pretty strong plastic smell when first opened but just let them air out a few days</li>
            <li>They are decent if you don&#x27;t want to spend too much money.</li>
            <li>My grand daughter is active in all her community plays</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why these brushes have such great reviews.</li>
            <li>The brushes are nice and soft although I thought they were a little too large.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I found was there are so many different brushes, most I won&#x27;t use, but then I&#x27;m not really into make-up</li>
            <li>The carrying case feels and looks high quality and sports a sort of worn leather look which feels very premium given the affordable price.</li>
            <li>Received very fast even during the busy holiday season.</li>
            <li>: wash them before using the first time, it will ensure you&#x27;re using a clean brush get rid of any loose hairs.</li>
            <li>But overall I feel their performance for the price is right on point!</li>
            <li>These brushes aren&#x27;t super soft but soft enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used 2 for seldom times but loved them none the less.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I will be using a professional set of makeup brushes....</li>
            <li>I had whole set of Bobbi brown and MAC brushs, but this set of brush just as awesome as those expensive brushes as they create the same result.</li>
            <li>This is my first complete set of brushes</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive about smells like me be aware of this problem</li>
            <li>I like big full brushes, and these ones are not quite full enough.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time using professional brushes.  </li>
            <li>I had to hang the set outside for a full 24 hours to air it out before use.</li>
            <li>Some of the brushes, we&#x27;re not sure what they&#x27;re for, but nice quality.</li>
            <li>i have no fault with them so far not a wrong buy.</li>
            <li>Overall not a bad starter set of brushes.</li>
            <li>The bigger brushes came with plastic protectors, which I thought was a very smart idea to keep those things in shape!</li>
            <li>Can not beat the price for these soft, professional looking brushes!!!!  </li>
            <li>The large powder brush lost quite a few bristles, but not so many that I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li>it folds up easily and needs minimal storage.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re decent for the price.</li>
            <li>if you prefer to use a fan brush to apply blusher then this one would be a decent pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What wasn&#x27;t okay was the constant harrassment from the company until I left a review.</li>
            <li>The brushes themselves are decent.  </li>
            <li>I mainly use the foundation and blush brushes.</li>
            <li>Decent quality brushes for the price</li>
            <li>the brushes are decent quality and do what they need to do.</li>
            <li>Worth the buy for the extra money we saved and the time saved with her getting ready to go places</li>
            <li>I have actually lost 2 in this short time but uts ok.</li>
            <li>They did the job decent.</li>
            <li>The brushes feel soft but they don&#x27;t pick up much product and they don&#x27;t put much product on your face.</li>
            <li>The brushes were surprisingly decent for the price.</li>
            <li>I just received these brushes and have not even used yet - but wanted to leave a review that they definitely feel and appear worthy of the reviews that encouraged me to buy them.  </li>
            <li>The quality is good and they last through some heavy usage.</li>
            <li>Such a super price too.</li>
            <li>The bristles come out constantly, and they don&#x27;t provide a super even coverage.</li>
            <li>Decent set of brushes for the price.</li>
            <li>Will definitely purchase more affordable sets from this seller in the future!!</li>
            <li>The price was unbeatable :) Will definitely look to Karity Cosmetics for beauty supplies I may need in the future!</li>
            <li>Its nice to have such a wide array of brushes at my disposal.  </li>
            <li>They pick up product very well and the brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li>When taking the brush set out of the box, which was very neatly packaged by the way, WOW, I was hit with an over powering chemical smell!  </li>
            <li>Very soft!  </li>
            <li>I had Sephora brushes before and was ready for a set with a bigger variety but still real hair (which are hard to find for a good price).</li>
            <li>but none of the fibers have come loose and the coverage is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Warning: These do have a strong smell when you first buy them but take it out of the plastic for a few hours and its practically gone.</li>
            <li>High quality and arrived on time.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these</li>
            <li>and she said they were high quality</li>
            <li>high quality.</li>
            <li>She noted how high quality the brushes were, commenting on the balanced weight and fineness of the hairs for even distribution.</li>
            <li>These brushes are high quality, I ordered them for my mom</li>
            <li>looks high end but got it for fraction of a price.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Truly like them and would recommend highly.</li>

            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>High quality brushes.</li>
            <li>I ordered 2 sets and would highly recommend these brushes to anyone.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>She like high quality brushes too...</li>
            <li>highly recommended</li>
            <li>I was looking for a variety of makeup brushes, but didn&#x27;t want to pay the high prices.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Seemed to be high quality brushes.</li>
            <li>These brushes provide both and are highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this kit to anyone</li>
            <li>I usually spend $20 to $30 dollars on single brushes and these work just as great .</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is that the bag has a strong paint/chemical smell- which I&#x27;m sure will go away.</li>
            <li>I ordered these for my mom, and while she likes them just fine (she&#x27;s never used make up brushes before), I found the bristles in these brushes rough on the skin, and they fall out from time to time.</li>
            <li>Had to retun these due to a strong pungent petroleum smell.</li>
            <li>They are soft and the makeup stays on the brushes very well.</li>
            <li>They look and feel like real professional brushes.</li>
            <li>The bristles have stayed in really well so far.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and soft bristles.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and professional attitude.</li>
            <li>Bristles are soft, but hold up very well to pressure and use.</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft, I have never been much into being high-maintanence with my makeup</li>
            <li>The brushes were very well made and presented in the case with a professional look.</li>
            <li>and I really wished the brushes were marked</li>
            <li>That would have been very helpful for someone that has never used professional brushes before.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally wear makeup</li>
            <li>This set is a lot bigger from what I imagined from the picture, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I hope it will last a long time :)</li>
            <li>Worth the price, definitely.</li>
            <li>the quality is ok for everyday.</li>
            <li>I use them everyday for a few months now and they are holding up beautifully.</li>
            <li>The only rush that was useful was the fanned brush.</li>
            <li>While she said that the carrying bag they come in was pretty generic, she didn&#x27;t really care about that.</li>
            <li>The black and white color looks nice.</li>
            <li>The brushes are lovely - very soft and definitely not cheaply made.</li>
            <li>The price was right and the brushes work well with any of the brands I currently use.</li>
            <li>Wish there was a medium/large brush, but other than that it&#x27;s fantastic</li>
            <li>The other brushes are fantastic.</li>
            <li>One fall, and my eyebrow brush is losing its bristles, all over my newly made face, due to cheap and brittle plastic.  </li>
            <li>would recommend for a gift to someone who is new at make up.</li>
            <li>I live it to</li>
            <li>It works so well with my new set of make up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite new to make-up application and decided to purchase a set of brushes.  </li>
            <li>My wife has been bugging me to let her spend an arm and a leg on new brushes from Sephora.</li>
            <li>but I needed some new brushes.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m new at this and have just been watching YouTube videos to learn.)</li>
            <li>They are nice quality, but a few bristles are falling out after only a month.</li>
            <li>They sent me three separate emails asking me to leave one, which I initially didn&#x27;t do because I really haven&#x27;t used these brushes all that much.</li>
            <li>At least those won&#x27;t shed as much and are much much much much more softer than the course finish of these brushes.</li>
            <li>They are very soft on your skin and apply my makeup evenly.</li>
            <li>The bristle does not fall and feels very soft on the skin.</li>
            <li>These are very soft quality brushes.</li>
            <li>Very soft.  </li>
            <li>These are high quality, professional brushes without a doubt.</li>
            <li>She was very surprised by my surprise gift.</li>
            <li>I warn you about a distinctive smell to it as some people are very sensitive to smelly makeup products but</li>
            <li>Very soft with no shedding and</li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft as well.</li>
            <li>She loves them, very professional.</li>
            <li>she has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Very soft.  </li>
            <li>They are very soft and the hair does not fall off.</li>
            <li>There high quality and the brush hairs are soft but sturdy.  </li>
            <li>It has very soft, but sturdy bristles.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very soft, and I like how they&#x27;re sovkight weight.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are very soft.  </li>
            <li>Handles are long enough to use easily unlike some of.</li>
            <li>Soft; easy to clean;bristles stay put...really nice for the price..you cannot go wrong here!</li>
            <li>Well made and so soft!</li>
            <li>Absolutely awesome trust you won&#x27;t be disappointed if you purchase them.</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>My 15 year old niece loves them!</li>
            <li>There was no shedding of hairs on the initial wash but the powder brush is starting to shed significantly while using it.</li>
            <li>No need to buy the $200.00 brushes when this one is so affordable and works exactly the same!!!!</li>
            <li>To me, makeup brush bristles should maintain shape especially after its first wash of cleaning.</li>
            <li>and they didn&#x27;t even last through their first wash.</li>
            <li>They do have a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; smell when you first open them</li>
            <li>I am not sure why the foundation brush does this, but for $11, it&#x27;s not terrible.</li>
            <li>this is what exactly i needed for daily use</li>
            <li>Brushes are soft and they work well!</li>
            <li>I am not sure why so many people are raving about them.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so convenient I feel like taking it everywhere, the brushes are soft and all as described!</li>
            <li>They are professional and all my friends thought I must have paid a fortune for them!</li>
            <li>They are better then Mac and other big name brushes!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not excessive.  </li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft!</li>
            <li>My favorite is the small angled brush, I use it for concealer under by brows, its great!!&lt;br /&gt;The brushes blend well, and dont dust away my blush or powders when I use them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do love the small tapered brushes and the eyeshadow brushes.</li>
            <li>But so far, no problems, and she loves them!</li>
            <li>I would only suggest discarding the carrying case which has a significant plastic smell, but if you&#x27;ll use it air it out outside for a bit.</li>
            <li>The bristles are nice and soft, but are firm enough to blend contouring makeup and eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>However, one of the brushes came apart the first time using it and the others loose &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; a little more the I would like.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say how they compare to more expensive brands, but they work for me and the price was right!</li>
            <li>Kind of weird, chemically smell to them at first</li>
            <li>far better brushes than anything iv bought in the past and for the price</li>
            <li>The brushes are natural and very soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot of brushes for the money and the brushes I have used so far (powder, blush, 2 eyeshadow, eye liner) are very soft.</li>
            <li>The brushes have held up well for the most part, but after 6 months of use some little hairs are falling out of the bigger brushes and they also are not as soft as some other cheap brushes that I have.</li>
            <li>I am still enjoying the brushes and they appear to be made well and will likely last a long time.</li>
            <li>I have one very expensive makeup brush and these are just as good!  </li>
            <li>I wash them after each use before I put them away, but make sure they are fully dry before use (the bristles will clump together when wet).</li>
            <li>I love the black and white handles.</li>
            <li>I love the black and white.</li>
            <li>Not ready to give up my super soft mac kabuki brush.</li>
            <li>The travel case is a little stinky, but it was fine after I aired it out.</li>
            <li>She uses them almost every day and has pretty much relegated her other brushes to the bottom drawer of shame.</li>
            <li>I am no expert in make up brushes but these seem to be fine, did not come apart on soaking in soap water for a few hours,</li>
            <li>Another thing is that they seem to only have medium, large and x-large shadow brushes.</li>
            <li>The large shadow brush looks and feel different.</li>
            <li>was a little worried to buy them from the cheap price</li>
            <li>Most of the eyeshadow ones are hard to use and they leave a log of hair while using them.</li>
            <li>Very high quality, I was not expecting such quality given the price point</li>
            <li>I had very high hopes for these brushes, despite the very low price.</li>
            <li>Nice set but bigger brushes are hard &amp; shed a lot.</li>
            <li>(Just because Im very picky), maybe have more color selections to choose from other than black?</li>
            <li>The natural brush heads are soft and sensitive on the skin.</li>
            <li>Maybe like girly colors like pink, light blue or purple</li>
            <li>even months after it has become clear that you have no desire to.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical on buying because of the mixed reviews but this is really a great set.  </li>
            <li>but I am happily surprised.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a makeup professional, so</li>
            <li>So soft and gives you the look of a professional make up artist.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had much need to actually use the set</li>
            <li>It is made of natural hair.</li>
            <li>Soft.</li>
            <li>My daughter is a professional performer and she loves these brushes.</li>
            <li>She was so surprised and the product&#x27;s work well.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the brushes.</li>
            <li>Bought these as a replacement for my old brushes.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how soft the brushes were.</li>
            <li>Gift for my 14 year old granddaughter.</li>
            <li>so I just took one from my old set.</li>
            <li>I have never had natural brushes before.</li>
            <li>the brushes are soft and don&#x27;t shed</li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t MAC type soft</li>

            <li>and the bristles are soft</li>
            <li>They are soft and don&#x27;t leave residue hairs all over.</li>
            <li>Bristles are soft, but the smell of plastic taste too.</li>
            <li>They are sturdy and soft.</li>
            <li>Ordered as a gift for a professional makeup artist.</li>
            <li>but i surprised my wife with them</li>
            <li>This is a thing with &#x27;professional brushes, and how you are supposed to hold them for application, so it&#x27;s not a slam on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Brushes are soft and wash well.</li>
            <li>Brush bristles fall out frequently.</li>
            <li>so much bought several for gifts!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a soft touch for a soft touch;  I wish I had ordered this set for gifts for friends....</li>
            <li>The brushes aren&#x27;t too course or soft and hold the makeup well.</li>
            <li>She says the&#x27;re soft and apply evenly.</li>
            <li>no bristle shedding so far.</li>
            <li>These brushes are soft and apply the makeup well, but they smell like chemicals and shed like you wouldn&#x27;t believe.</li>
            <li>Wow, I have now a complete set of make up brush without slashing my wallet.  </li>
            <li>It also helps keep them soft when I wash them with baby shampoo.</li>
            <li>No shedding and they are so soft.</li>
            <li>The brushes work well and are really soft on your face.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if my 22 year old will like or not</li>
            <li>They are soft, they don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li>I purchased these for my 16 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>The hair of brushes are not as soft as I</li>
            <li>She can now throw away the really old brushes she has had for years.</li>
            <li>they are so soft.</li>
            <li>I bouth this brushes because a would like exchange my old ones.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re incredibly soft for being synthetic brushes.</li>
            <li>I have complete control placing makeup where I want it to be applied.  </li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m really surprised with the quality.</li>
            <li>They are soft and hold the powder and quality made.</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft and they get the job done well.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re extremely soft.</li>
            <li>The bristles don&#x27;t shed and they maintain their shape after cleaning (using cleanser for natural bristles).</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I haven&#x27;t been using professional brushes sooner.  </li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m a beginner and far from being a pro, I decided to start with those brushes.</li>
            <li>Soft against your skin, well made.</li>

            <li>The only issue I had was the smell, but all I&#x27;ll need to do is wash them once before use, so that really isn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
            <li>These are professional quality affordable make up brushes that are an alternative to some of the high-end brands.</li>
            <li>After a week or so, however, the bristles come out too frequently.</li>
            <li>Brushes are to soft to even blend anything</li>
            <li>They are soft and put the makeup on evenly.</li>
            <li>The brushes are SO soft and don&#x27;t have a smell really, as far as the packaging and the pouch there was bubble wrap</li>
            <li>The smell is completely like plastic.  </li>
            <li>I gave them to my 16 yr old daughter</li>
            <li>what chemical they used it here with such a smell and really believe that can be harmful to the health.  </li>
            <li>i get so busy.</li>
            <li>I like the variety and quality, the professional look and feel of these.  </li>
            <li>so I aired them out in my living room before using.</li>
            <li>She feels like she is getting a professional makeup application each time she uses them.</li>
            <li>They are professional quality and</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t pick up powders very well especially if you want to use them to apply blush or bronzer</li>
            <li>I use these as a professional for weddings and every day use.</li>
            <li>So soft and do not shed.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my adult daughter</li>
            <li>My eyeshadow especially looks much smoother and even then before.  </li>
            <li>It is not made of natural hair.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something that feels soft like silk over your cheeks, keep looking.</li>
            <li>The bag is plastic not leather, the brushes stink and they are a cheap harsh fiber...</li>
            <li>If your looking for a professional grade makeup brush set this is not the set you want.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and hold the powders well.</li>
            <li>I purchased these for my 15 year old cousin.</li>
            <li>Soft, and none of the hairs come out.</li>
            <li>Just what I was looking for, a complete set, soft brushes that actulally do the job.</li>
            <li>The only other thing is that I noticed the bigger foundation, blush, and contouring brushes shed quite significantly the first couple of times I used them.</li>
            <li>even if you have sensitive skin (like me) bag has kinda an overwleming smell tho</li>
            <li>As a professional photographer I look for both value and consistency in the application of makeup for models.</li>
            <li>There is every size you would need for a professional looking makeup application.</li>
            <li>Bristles were really soft.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very convenient for on the go (added an extra star for that).</li>
            <li>and so far I have no complaints.</li>
            <li>bought this set as a gift for my 15 yr old-</li>
            <li>I ended up giving the set to my 7 year old daughter to play with.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t shed at all and are really soft.</li>
            <li>I had read a few reviews about cheap makeup brushes smelling like chemicals.</li>
            <li>If I bought all of these brushes at a regular store, they&#x27;d be at least double the price, so it&#x27;s a good deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They differ by structure a tiny bit, but size wise, none of the eye brushes are small enough for small and smooth</li>
            <li>There was an odor when I first opened it, but that went away within the first few days.</li>
            <li>And so many essential brush types are missing.</li>
            <li>the feel of these brushes is nice but they leave alot of broken bristles.</li>
            <li>I ordered these on sale, expecting them to be mediocre, but they are honestly so good.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t go wrong with good quality brushes for the low😝😁</li>
            <li>Good set for beginners for the price, but the fibers are itchy, feel scratchy, and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>I wish the was one more with tight, flat bristles</li>
            <li>These bristles are a bit more stiff and coarse than the synthetic that I am used to, but I like the firmness when applying my makeup.</li>
            <li>I really had trouble finding the right brushes for the look I want to produce.</li>
            <li>But she was spending money left and right on different makeup applicators.</li>
            <li>Well made brushes for very little money, they came very quickly.</li>
            <li>however, there is an odor when they are first opened (like dry erase markers) but with a wash or two, that goes away completely.</li>
            <li>The quality is also good as none of the brushes had any loose heads, as I have seen reported on other brushes in other reviews.</li>
            <li>They work extremely well and totally make a huge difference in makeup application/</li>
            <li>First Impression- When i opened it they smelled like cement, i washed them and let them air dry.</li>
            <li>The bigger brushes are okay, but the smaller eyeshadow brushes (which is what I really needed) are scratchy and pick up very little pigment.</li>
            <li>Edit: Just notices that the company describes these as being of \\&quot;quality natural hair\\&quot; in the first product description and then writes farther down that \\&quot;The brushes are made from a combination of natural hair and synthetic hair for lasting performance, so they are soft and silky on top, yet firm and durable on the bottom.\\&quot; \\&quot;Soft and silky\\</li>
            <li>They arrived earlier than I thought, they are truly high quality, and the packaging was professional as well.</li>
            <li>It looks very professional, and the brushes are very soft, and the handles are solid.</li>
            <li>Overall the brushes were of decent quality.</li>
            <li>I when I first received the brushed they came individually wrapped in the roll case.</li>
            <li>It does have a slight plastic smell when you first open it, but after it was out it open, it went away quickly.</li>
            <li>i wish it had more small brushes then having three big ones</li>
            <li>Overall a decent set of brushes, though.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with the head becoming displaced from the stem like other users, but the brush hairs have begun to fall out left and right.</li>
            <li>High quality brushes for a low price.</li>
            <li>These are such high quality brushes.</li>
            <li>The brushes are high quality, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>I bought these because they had such high reviews.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and these brushes are soft enough to not irritate my skin at all, plus it has every brush I needed and wanted.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the brushes daily for a couple months and have seen no negative signs of wear.</li>
            <li>These are exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>I will recommend washing them before using, only because they have a scent, but that&#x27;s normal.    </li>
            <li>but I expected a higher quality.</li>
            <li>Brushes are exactly what i expected.</li>
            <li>The brushes are fine if you only plan to use them at home, only, but they are too long to carry for daily maintenance or application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The little pouch did have a funky smell to it upon arrival, but it quickly went away.</li>
            <li>, both the brushes and the bag have the very sharp smell of synthetic materials and although I put them in front of fresh air for some days, the smell still remains.</li>
            <li>I would recommend them to anyone who does primarily use liquid or cream cosmetics, with only a few powder cosmetics.</li>
            <li>I ordered this brush set to replace an older one, my previous set had much softer bristled brushes.</li>
            <li>A good investment for few years at least.</li>
            <li>Two brushes have come off at the metal end from the wood end, but a little glue fixed that right up.</li>
            <li>They are very soft , however, they did have a smell similar to nail polish remover, but it wasn&#x27;t a smell that lasted after you have cleaned them .</li>
            <li>I really love these brushes they have every brush from a tiny detail brush to big and fluffy one that blen!</li>
            <li>I was hoping to get that single brush replaced, but the company actually refunded me the whole purchase!</li>
            <li>I really love how soft they are and mine hardly had any loose hair after washing them.</li>
            <li>Some loose hairs came out the first couple times I used them, but it was no big offense.</li>
            <li>Also, this exact set retails for $85 or something on their website, I am not sure if this is realistic price</li>
            <li>I have had some pretty bad brushes in my lifetime, these are amazing.</li>
            <li>They work well for their general purpose.</li>
            <li>They seem to be very well made and will last a long time.</li>
            <li>She recently started professional make up school</li>
            <li>Bought these brushes as a birthday present for a 12 year old girl that loves makeup.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not applying product harshly (no one should), so I don&#x27;t understand why they come out with such ease...</li>
            <li>So far I have only used 2 brushes.</li>
            <li>I reviewed this some time back in early May, I know because it was before I would be traveling.</li>
            <li>, they are soft and made well enough.</li>
            <li>Please note these were bought for personal use not for professional use.</li>
            <li>soft enough esp</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and don&#x27;t feel cheap and sharp like some of the other similar packages on Amazon.</li>
            <li>So far they have not left any brush hairs on me as i am putting make up on.</li>
            <li>The brushes themselves are ok, not great, but usable.</li>
            <li>The case doesn&#x27;t look as expensive or nice as the brushes themselves</li>
            <li>I ordered them mainly for the smaller brushes to use with eye shadows and for blending since I prefer synthetic for foundation, but in this case I found the natural hairs to be of a lesser quality than expected - course and wild!</li>
            <li>the first day some brittles came loose, but after that and after even washing them a couple times there is no major brittle loss.</li>
            <li>I have several different brushes and these are just as good as the high end expensive ones!</li>
            <li>Definitely 5 stars all the way, if you are relatively new to makeup brushes like me than I would definitely recommend this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pure spray paint.&lt;br /&gt;I opened the box because there were other items that I had ordered in it.</li>
            <li>Mine had no strong odors, and I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to that.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t actually expect them to be as great due to the price I paid for them, but boy, was I wrong.</li>
            <li>There was a slight laquer odor when they first arrived.</li>
            <li>No loose hairs.</li>
            <li>Much nicer than I expected!</li>
            <li>little extra cash for two day shipping was so worth it.</li>
            <li>I only used it once, but overall it was really soft and does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li>I left the brushes open for a week and it seemed to help, but I don&#x27;t see the smell going away completely.</li>
            <li>I would recommend the brushes to my friends they are really soft and feel more expensive than they were.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve given them a few months and a few cleanings to see if it would get better, but it hasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Even after washing they still remained soft and did not shed, unlike my more expensive ones.</li>
            <li>The brushes were kind of rough and irritating to the skin.</li>
            <li>The other facial brushes do shed, especially when you first use them.</li>
            <li>The case was a little bit stinky at first, but over time that went away.</li>
            <li>The brushes smelled a little funny but let them sit out</li>
            <li>This brush set was purchased as a gift for my teen aged granddaughter who participates in competitive dance and is a pom pom girl at her high school.</li>
            <li>They are going right in the garbage for I am past the return deadline.</li>
            <li>It is all natural but the brushes don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The leather from the brush holder is high quality, you can just tell.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are so soft but firm enough to get the makeup on your face too.</li>
            <li>Used daily for several weeks already with no loose bristles.</li>
            <li>These brushes pick up product very well, are soft but firm, the ends are not plastic and long, and they come with bristle protectors.</li>
            <li>Brushes have a sort of &amp;#34;petroleum&amp;#34; smell when package first opened (see others&#x27; remarks), but goes away if left open to air after a few days.</li>
            <li>The bag does have a smell when you first get it, like some other reviews have stated...almost like wet paint.</li>
            <li>After heavy use on the large brush it&#x27;s been losing some bristles, however that could just be me</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the product came smelling quite strongly of the warehouse or wherever it was stored but it aired out after a few days.</li>
            <li>The price is what really sets them apart, at a little over a dollar a piece...</li>
            <li>As a few have stated, I noticed bristles have fallen out; but only on the large powder/kabuki brush.</li>
            <li>and she said she bought very expensive brushes before but this one is top quality i highly recommend it</li>

            <li> They come in a nice case, and there is a web address to go and read about each brush&#x27;s function, which I thought was a nice additional touch.</li>
            <li> They included a nice reusable case that fits nicely into her kit and each brush was packed in a protective plastic.</li>

            <li> The handles are a bit longer than I like them, but maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m used to my own brushes.</li>

            <li> best part is she thinks i got them from Ulta and paid more than i did ;)</li>
            <li> The faux leather does have a funky smell but that dissipates after a while These are decent brushes, excellent set for the price.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great for beginners and the price is pretty good.</li>
            <li> Travels very easily and is nice to keep brushes organized when not in use.</li>
            <li> They are very soft! :D</li>
            <li> High quality brushes at a great price!</li>
            <li> This kit is suitable for any kind of make up.</li>
            <li> Love love very nice... :)</li>
            <li> Very good quality brushes, good blending ability, no shedding, soft and durable.</li>
            <li> Perfect starter set for my new business.</li>
            <li> Great brush set, soft, works well and the price was great.</li>
            <li> great product, quick delivery.</li>
            <li> but i will learn,all that for a super great price.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this item, the brushes are good weight and the bristles aren&#x27;t like silk, but they&#x27;re nicer than anything you&#x27;d get at CVS or Walgreens for the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So if you want some really cheap- but nice make-up brushes then this is a good buy.</li>
            <li> They were a great value for the money and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> She was impressed that they were very soft and well made.</li>
            <li> The pouch that they came in had to go immediately thoughbecause of a very strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li> Very strong odor.</li>
            <li> The brushes and pouch have a very strong smell.</li>
            <li> They had a very strong smell when opened.</li>
            <li> Got them just 4 days after I purchased them, very strong chemical smell..</li>
            <li> The case has a very strong smell.</li>
            <li> However, when I opened the pouch to check out the brushes there is a very strong aroma of what I think is varnish.  </li>
            <li> However, I will say that the brushes and the pouch has a very strong chemical smell as others have stated.</li>
            <li> Immediately after opening the box I could smell a very strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very strong like alcohol type smell.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t very strong as a matter of fact</li>
            <li> Smells like very strong plastic.</li>
            <li> They are the best brushes I have had so far!</li>

            <li> Another comment I&#x27;d like to make is that these brushes seem to be better than Elf brand brushes, so that&#x27;s a plus for the price.</li>

            <li> and I am really pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> It really seems like a great value.</li>

            <li> Love it, a bit of a smell</li>
            <li> You get so many brushes....</li>
            <li> I bought two sets of these brushes and love them.</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased them.  </li>
            <li> But once the smell passed, I have zero complaints :)</li>
            <li> Love the brush set.</li>
            <li> They are so soft its just amazing no scratchy feeling on skin just heavenly softness and the size is very nice too.</li>
            <li> They are good quality and just the right amount of each size for my makeup needs.</li>
            <li> The case is great as well to keep everything safe and new!</li>
            <li> but they appear to be beautiful brushes, very soft &amp; case</li>
            <li> My Fiancé said that they are very nice and spread makup very well for the price.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend !!!!!</li>
            <li> As a former Lancôme makeup artist, I love these brushes!!!</li>
            <li> I am very excited to try them out</li>
            <li> I think my niece will be very excited to receive these.</li>
            <li> I use it with higher end Mac or drug store brand makeup and it make the drugstore makeup look way more controlled and the Mac makeup looks over the top good with these brushes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup that often, and when I did before I got this brush set, I was happy with what I could do; but now with this new set, I have been able to do a lot more with my eye makeup.</li>
            <li> She says they&#x27;re great and smooth on her skin and hold up really well!</li>
            <li> Pretty good product, though they shed more bristles during use than I would like.</li>
            <li> Decent quality for the price, however the brushes are shedding and don&#x27;t quite look great.</li>
            <li> Still, this is a great buy of a high quality product.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest these for those who want quality brushes for a great price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> high quality, no odor- great purchase.</li>
            <li> Also the case they come is is super cute!</li>
            <li> Amazing product and the price is right!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super soft on skin and are great for powder blending; have yet to try then on creams!</li>
            <li> Super nice for the cost :)</li>
            <li> Brushes are perfect, I just wish the case didn&#x27;t cause such a strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li> A pretty good product</li>
            <li> I have to say these brushes are pretty good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclaimer: I received a code to apply a full cost discount to this item, but this is my honest opinion on the product.</li>
            <li> these brushes are really soft and brushes on makeup evenly and quite beautifully.</li>
            <li> So I read the reviews before I bought these and had a pretty good idea of what they might be.</li>
            <li> They apply quite well (not my #1 but pretty good).</li>
            <li> Good quality and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Pretty good brushes, they do what theyre supposed to.</li>
            <li> At first, I loved this brush set.</li>
            <li> This is my first set of makeup brushes and they seem to be good quality.  </li>
            <li> I was going to rate this product 3 stars, but for the price it is a pretty good.</li>
            <li> But as I said before, for the price it is pretty good.</li>
            <li> These brushes surely are not the best quality, but for the price, they are WAY BETTER than I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wearing make-up, but I thought these brushes were great.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I thought the pouch it came with was super tacky</li>
            <li> The brushes seem okay, but there was an incredibly strong chemical smell when i opened the package.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on good brushes but at the same time I wanted to them to be good quality.</li>
            <li> They are good brushes, soft and nice quality bristles and handles.  </li>
            <li> , my make up apply much better, the brushes does not shed, which is the most important.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t comprehend how this product got so many good reviews...</li>
            <li> Great brushes, very soft.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, very soft and well made.</li>

            <li> Very high quality, good value</li>
            <li> They are very good quality; soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> i bought this for a gift for a friend who is becoming a make up artist.</li>
            <li> For the price  and my first set of brushes I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> So far these brushes work great.  </li>
            <li> They are great quality and work just like the professional brushes in salons.</li>
            <li> I think these professional studio quality makeup brushes are great.  </li>
            <li> Happy so far with the product</li>
            <li> I love the carrying case and how light weight the brushes are.</li>
            <li> Now i dont necesarily use all of the brushes but the ones i do use are great and, just like the description says, soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I am sure my nieces will enjoy them for X-mas.</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves are soft and apply great.</li>
            <li> She was impressed by the wide selection of brushes.</li>
            <li> the longer handles allow a more secure grip.</li>
            <li> Seems like something that I will enjoy for many years.</li>
            <li> good product with high quality!</li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t beat them honestly, they&#x27;re well worth the $12 I paid.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them much, but when I have I have loved them.</li>
            <li> These brushes would be good if they were fuller and didnt shed so much.</li>
            <li> Some brushes are good, others not so much.</li>
            <li> They loved them so much</li>
            <li> I have only used one of them so far, but the quality looks good, and the price is excellent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, for a person who has to use natural brushes it was a good buy, but, they could&#x27;a been better.</li>
            <li> The blend of the brushes make it as good as real hair.</li>
            <li> , we loved them so much</li>
            <li> When I took them out of the package they had a very strong chemical smell, but that dissipated quickly.</li>
            <li> Easy fast and really good pricing</li>
            <li> Great brushes, very soft and precise.</li>
            <li> As a makeup artist I own a ton of brushes, this Karity Cosmetics set is right up there with Sigma and Mac.</li>
            <li> The makeup case is very plastic-y but pretty good for storing the brushes on the go!</li>
            <li> Very nice complete make-up pieces.</li>
            <li> As long as you keep them clean they apply makeup beautifully !</li>
            <li> But other than that, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I just used the brushes for the first time this morning, but I already love them!  </li>
            <li> Other than that all of the brushes are great!</li>
            <li> Pretty good quality bristle wise but the handles separate far too easily</li>
            <li> Her make up goes on easily using them</li>
            <li> Great price for how many different brushes come in the set, however, you get what you pay for...</li>
            <li> I received them very quick.</li>
            <li> Great set for someone like me who doesn&#x27;t need so many different types of eyeshadow brushes.</li>
            <li> The packaging rolls up for easy storage.</li>
            <li> Also, I have found that some of the smaller ones work great if you are using with some sort of cream type cosmetic, cream eye shadow, cream contour, concealer, etc., but require a lot more application with a powder cosmetic to get the desired color.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t know what brushes are for you can easily find on their website.</li>
            <li> One of the brushes came with some glue on the tip, which I couldn&#x27;t remove easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply makeup</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> The case has a flap that protects the brushes so it is easy to store and take them on the go without the worry that</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow brushes actually make my eyeshadow more pigmented, which is great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so compact and so easy to take with you everywhere</li>
            <li> The brushes are compact and lightweight, making them easy to use.</li>
            <li> The storage case makes packing for a trip easy.</li>
            <li> It makes it easy to take with you anywhere, plus keeps the brushes organized.</li>
            <li> There was a strong chemical smell on them and it made me not want I use them on my skin.</li>
            <li> The case is nice and not to big and good for traveling.</li>
            <li> You have to air it out the plastic smell is so strong</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re is a STRONG paint smell</li>
            <li> but it has a strong paint smell but another</li>
            <li> Good quality for s decent price</li>
            <li> The smell is not too strong, but noticeable.</li>
            <li> However, the brushes have a strong odor.</li>
            <li> Does have a strong smell of plastic, however.  </li>
            <li> Good quality, nice sized brushes overall...</li>
            <li> When you pull it out of the package , the case has a really strong smell.</li>
            <li> Did not have the strong chemical smell I was worried about.</li>
            <li> but they do have a strong odor.</li>
            <li> The case has a really strong smell that I hope will go away soon.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t shed at all, the case that they come in is lovely, and the price is right!</li>
            <li> I will continue to use them &amp; am happy with them in general.</li>
            <li> The brush kit looks great and I will be excited to try it out this week as I have a busy week that will need lots of &amp;#34;glam&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The color seems a lot more true</li>
            <li> This is the first brush kit I have purchased, so I don&#x27;t have a lot to compare it to to be completely honest.</li>
            <li> i liked at first but then started to shed.</li>
            <li> I am using this kind of thing first time.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> Love the cool case they come in.</li>
            <li> I really liked them when I first got them.</li>
            <li> I have been using the set about 6 months and they are still good as new.</li>
            <li> I bought one in black, and purple for my best friend.</li>
            <li> Just wash your brushes like always before using them and it will be just fine.</li>
            <li> But, they work just fine.</li>
            <li> The product is fine.</li>
            <li> The brushes were fine</li>
            <li> These brushes are just &amp;#34;Okay&amp;#34; But they often &amp;#34;shed&amp;#34; or pieces of the bristles break off while applying my foundation, they work fine, but I would not purchase these again.  </li>
            <li> I think for the price point these will work fine</li>
            <li> Only best recommendations;-)</li>
            <li> The smell has dissipated and is fine now.</li>
            <li> but it works fine with powders, I would buy again</li>
            <li> And i&#x27;m pretty sure the bristles aren&#x27;t authentic.</li>
            <li> Product was just as promised and was shipped in fine time.</li>
            <li> Have been using them for 3 months now and holding up just fine.</li>
            <li> A quick wash got rid of the smell!</li>
            <li> then that brush are very soft and good quality</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very soft, the bristles do not fall out and they feel good against your face.</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price and very soft.</li>
            <li> Item in good shape and very complete with all these brushes.</li>
            <li> Exceptional, high quality.</li>
            <li> They are absolutely everything &amp; more !</li>
            <li> I love this Brush set my very first set as I&#x27;m beginning to experience in makeup</li>
            <li> Received my brushes fast and I love them!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, these brushes are amazingly soft!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife so she can use it for her new sephora makeup palatte, she said they&#x27;re soft and work perfectly, she loves them.</li>
            <li> It has worked, the brushes are super soft and do a great job of picking the make up up and applying it to the face.</li>
            <li> Wife absolutely loved brushes and they got here super fast</li>
            <li> Beautiful brushes even better then expected!</li>
            <li> When I first received them, the case had a very strong odor (like paint fumes), but after I let it air or in my garage overnight, the smell had gone.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;there is a very strong odor at first when opened</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very strong at first and made me feel like I was in an auto body shop.</li>
            <li> huge chunks just fell out of it.</li>
            <li> I waited to write my review until I had used these brushes for awhile to give a accurate review of the product.</li>

            <li> Well, I managed to find these brushes and so far so good.</li>
            <li> Both said they loved the set and even got rid of their old brushes</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> they are really good quality and they are soft.</li>
            <li> Bought for my niece who is an aspiring professional makeup artist and she loved the quality</li>
            <li> These brushes are about as good as you can get without spending a professional quality price.</li>
            <li> but so far all is good.</li>
            <li> They are soft and good quality.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> They are sturdy, soft and good quality.</li>
            <li> Would recommend purchasing if you are looking for a nice set of high quality brushes that are easy to take along with you and cover all of your cosmetic application needs.</li>
            <li> Long handles provide great control, and are easy to handle.</li>
            <li> The brushes and bag had an overwhelmingly strong chemical/plastic smell when I first opened the package, and most of that has faded but it hasn&#x27;t gone away.</li>
            <li> Recommend to wash the brushes first !!</li>
            <li> so much !!!</li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves it!!!  </li>
            <li> Very amazing quality for the low price.</li>
            <li> Obviously not designer brushes at this price, but honestly they do a pretty good job.</li>
            <li> Easy for organizing and quick travels.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, good packaging, were exactly as described.</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves are natural hair, super soft, and blend flawlessly.</li>
            <li> I bought it based on the good reviews and really regret it when I received the product since there is strong smell that really made me dizzy and wanted to throw up.  </li>
            <li> The handles are nice and long that the brush blends the makeup nicely.</li>
            <li> I really like the quality of the brushes, the bristles do not flake off and makes applying my cosmetics very easy.</li>
            <li> These were just what I was looking for, and I&#x27;ve been enjoying them very much.</li>
            <li> Great deal for someone who is new to cosmetics or wants to save money on brushes.</li>
            <li> Those brushes are super soft and good quality.</li>
            <li> I thought they looked like a great set of makeup brushes and I will probably buy a set for myself later on, as my own are getting old.  </li>
            <li> this is so good with make up and barely falls out.</li>
            <li> Although, I&#x27;ve not had a chance to test them for long, they appear to be a great investment for anyone was trying to expand their brush collection or travel a lot.</li>
            <li> I will update this after some use, but if you are on the fence, the brush holder alone is probably worth the price!</li>
            <li> I love the fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Such a great price and my brushes are soft and amazing.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product been using for the past week now.</li>
            <li> I was excited to order this product</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny, and then some!</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t the Absolute best professional brushes, but they are really close..  </li>
            <li> So worth every penny!  </li>
            <li> Really great quality for such a reasonable price!!</li>
            <li> Based on good reviews, I had high hopes for these brushes as an inexpensive alternative to higher end brands.</li>
            <li> and you clean them after you use them anyway.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised at the quality for such a great price!</li>
            <li> I loved the makeup set, I couldn&#x27;t have spent my money better</li>
            <li> Overall, great buy and worth the money.</li>
            <li> These brushes were super cheap (</li>
            <li> love the big powder brush, the eyeshadow brushes are nice too&lt;br</li>
            <li> but i love it grate for starting a brush collecting and a really nice set and bag for the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just getting into really doing my makeup and these brushes are great so far.</li>
            <li> The packaging was professional and the overall presentation was excellent.</li>
            <li> That way i can keep them clean.</li>
            <li> These are really great brushes they are soft and very sturdy.</li>
            <li> I took the cover off each one of them and rubbed them on the palm of my hand to take the dust that makes it smell, then clean them with a wipe to take  off the excess.</li>
            <li> #34;Amazon order needs your attention.&amp;#34;  Every time I clicked to find a message saying, &amp;#34;Please! - We Really need some good reviews on these brushes!&amp;#34; Very tacky.</li>
            <li> I  went through many reviews to find good brushes that wouldn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg and had minimal shedding.</li>
            <li> loved it highly recommend it and the price is amazing regular price thesis are 80 bucks</li>
            <li> Very soft brushes in a nice case.</li>
            <li> Love it although it does carry an intense smell but other then that its pretty awesome</li>
            <li> Other than that, they have held up beautifully.</li>
            <li> I rarely experienced having to deal with loose bristles on my face.</li>
            <li> and they are very nice quality, soft brushes for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> The brushes themselves aren&#x27;t anything special but work</li>
            <li> For me, there is one too many large brushes.</li>
            <li> Review comes from a make up wearer during the work week and going out for special occasions</li>
            <li> She seemed pretty happy with them, and with my limited knowledge I can say that they looked very nice, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> They are amazing I have used them frequently</li>
            <li> This is true, and mostly smells like the leather pouch that it came in was straight from a paint factory.</li>
            <li> Looks professional and the materials are nice.</li>
            <li> The brushes are well made with even build nice soft tapered tips.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my teenage granddaughter she loved the brushes.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 13 year old daughter, and she is thrilled with all the brushes.</li>
            <li> If looking for something good and affordable then look no further.</li>
            <li> I would not purchase the full set again.</li>
            <li> Love how fast this shipped</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally, the size differences between the brushes aren&#x27;t true to the display picture.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my 18 yr old daughter, she loves them, says they are really nice quality</li>
            <li> I got these brushed because the good reviews</li>
            <li> (length keeps you from being able to apply too much pressure when held correctly).</li>
            <li> They look nice, are soft and well finished.</li>
            <li> Nice soft bristles.</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves are good quality, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I just received my 12 makeup brushes and am thrilled to toss out all of my old ones.</li>
            <li> Nice, soft brushes.</li>
            <li> nice soft brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice and soft and I haven had any issues with the falling apart.</li>
            <li> Such a good variety of brushes.</li>
            <li> Love them work really well.</li>
            <li> I have to tweeze the bristles off my face if I use the foundation brush, but I still use several of the brushes and for the price they were a fair product I would say.  </li>
            <li> I got nice, soft and hight cuality set.</li>
            <li> Overall it was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> These were a gift for my grand daughter she absolutely loves them.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft, the case is handy and it has plenty of brushes to choose from.</li>
            <li> these are lovely, quality, real hair brushes.</li>
            <li> Bought these as a Christmas present for my wife she loves these brushes good quality and she tells me all the time</li>
            <li> The leather pouch with it is so darn cute, it doesn&#x27;t have that much of an odor, to me it smells like leather.</li>
            <li> Good purchase overall</li>
            <li> The bag was nice and soft, but I have no need.  </li>
            <li> They pick up a good amount of product so you don&#x27;t constantly have to be redipping your brush.</li>
            <li> And if you can spend some more, real techniques are the holy grail.</li>
            <li> Relatively to the price, I got a good quality set of brushes.</li>
            <li> Only one hair came out the brush so thats good in my book.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes for my teenage daughter and loved them</li>
            <li> I love the case, it&#x27;s very convenient.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s a great deal in terms of options for different brushes; was just surprised given that, that I still found myself needing 1 or 2 types that weren&#x27;t there...think it has to do more with the quality.</li>
            <li> Good brushes especially for the price.</li>
            <li> nice, soft Brushes.</li>
            <li> I needed some really nice makeup brushes, and ordered this set so I could toss my old ones.</li>
            <li> i love it ..works really well</li>
            <li> I love them so much</li>
            <li> so they&#x27;re good for my daily</li>
            <li> A lot of good makeup brushes for a low price.</li>
            <li> I love the brushes - really high quality!</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> Not a bad set for the price but after a month or so of use, my brush started losing bristles.</li>
            <li> Not bad for this price.</li>
            <li> Very excited about the fan brush in particular!</li>
            <li> Super soft and really nice.</li>
            <li> I love the texture of the natural bristles, the quality is high-end, they are easy</li>
            <li> The brush selection is great, and they have a very soft, professional feel.  </li>
            <li> When i first recieved it, it had strong scent</li>
            <li> case does have a strong smell at first.</li>
            <li> The pouch had a strong \\&quot;factory acetone like\\&quot; odor to it at first, but it eventually faded.</li>
            <li> the case smells strongly of vinyl and it&#x27;s pretty bulky.</li>
            <li> Pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li> Also on the lip lining brush, you can tell it&#x27;s going to fray pretty easily.</li>
            <li> Firstly, the smell of the case is quite strong.</li>
            <li> Also, when I first opened the package, there was a strong &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34; smell emitting from the brush case.</li>
            <li> Other than that great brushes.</li>
            <li> Other than that they are great and within my price range.</li>
            <li> the carry case is great for traveling and fits other brushes</li>
            <li> Other than that, I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> When they are cleaned bristles do not fall out, a problem I&#x27;ve experienced with other brands.</li>
            <li> Nice brush kit in handy little wrap type case.</li>
            <li> I love my new make up brushes!</li>
            <li> I love my new brushes!  </li>
            <li> They got here really quick too.</li>
            <li> but overall I was very impressed with the quality especially for the price!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to use so many different brushes or what all are suppose to be used for :)   </li>
            <li> I could not be more pleased especially with the texture and price.</li>
            <li> I would buy these again because they seem to be made very well and don&#x27;t look cheap or wear cheap at all.</li>
            <li> I was lucky to come across it when I did.</li>
            <li> Received product quickly.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> Work very well and easy to clean,</li>
            <li> I unrolled and removes the plastic packaging and the odor was gone quickly.</li>
            <li> The big blush brush has worked excellently in evenly applying brush to all the desired facial regions with no spotting, blotching or streaking.</li>
            <li> Product got here super quick.</li>
            <li> Variety of tips are probably more than needed (for most), but offer the opportunity to experiment with different shading styles.</li>
            <li> They came quickly.</li>
            <li> I was super exited for them but</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> We love the brushes definitely will buy more .</li>
            <li> Like headache worthy smell.</li>
            <li> It would have been nice if each brush was labeled to indicate intended use, but that&#x27;s not a big deal and the website provides detailed explanation</li>
            <li> I just now washed them carefully in a mild shampoo bath and they are drying.</li>
            <li> Luckily, it went away soon.</li>
            <li> I am excited to finally have a full set of brushes to call my own.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These are high quality brushes and i love the way they feel.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;leather&amp;#34; case is adorable and seems to be high quality.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend and would consider purchasing more for gifts.</li>
            <li> she has had many high end makup brushes.</li>
            <li> Better off buying a high quality brush at sephora or Mac.</li>
            <li> Love my brushes and certainly will be buying these a gifts for makeup loving friends in the future.</li>
            <li> Love the fan brush and case :) I&#x27;m fairly new to makeup but seems decent.</li>
            <li> but overall very satisfied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very useful, I like it very much</li>
            <li> I use Bare Minerals makeup and although they have nice brushes too they seem to need to be cleaned a lot.</li>
            <li> First, the case is so unbelievably cheap looking.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this brush set after reading several reviews from others who were very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Loved the carrying case, however I felt the handle of the brushes were a bit too long, which I was not a fan of.</li>
            <li> The bag isn&#x27;t extremely large so it makes it easy to pack for trips.</li>
            <li> Super duper fast!!</li>
            <li> welcome gives some brief indications of what the different types of brush are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the most useful brushes in the make up</li>
            <li> Love my new brushes.</li>
            <li> Very professional spa style brushes!!!!.</li>
            <li> The smaller in the set work pretty good.</li>
            <li> Brushes pick up product easily yet deposit on the skin in a very controlled manned.</li>
            <li> My price point at the time didn&#x27;t include any higher quality brushes, and I really wish I had just saved up more.</li>
            <li> Most of it seemed to come from the plastic wrapping, so once I got rid of that it was better but not completely eliminated.</li>
            <li> It really smelled strongly of some chemical order.</li>
            <li> But other than that, amazing quality!</li>
            <li> But overall, I absolutely love them for the value!</li>
            <li> Exactly what we needed!</li>
            <li> They are exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I love every one of these professional makeup brushes!</li>
            <li> Definitely don&#x27;t need more brushes than this!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting !</li>
            <li> I like these brushes and it comes with a good variety, but one of the brush heads  is loose</li>
            <li> I would most definitely give them a strong 5 stars if not for the smell.</li>
            <li> I love the convenient of the pouch case bag, taking it anywhere with you, and all the brushes was super soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> Since my skin is very sensitive, I am delighted that bristles are extremely soft.</li>
            <li> For me, I just needed a few more new inexpensive brushes for the time being, and its a great set for that and especailly travel.</li>
            <li> easy to clean and super soft.</li>
            <li> The foundation brush doesn&#x27;t work very well but the rest of them are fine.</li>
            <li> They are super soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> all the brushes are so useful and everything blends really well together with the brush!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are fantastic and very high quality.</li>
            <li> I rate this product overall an A+ for its ease of use, sophisticated design and large array of brushes which I haven&#x27;t been able to find elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> twelve brushes contained within the roll are all very well finished and balanced with full-size handles that are comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;There are no instructions with the brushes but logging on to KarityCosmetics.com</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing, especially for the price!</li>

            <li> Overall i think they were an amazing deal.</li>
            <li> These brushes feel amazing soft and they hold product very well.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money</li>
            <li> good product came faster than expected</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I looked on the website and its worth 85$...</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews</li>
            <li> She says it was worth 5 stars.</li>
            <li> For the money, it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> This brush set definitely worth the price</li>
            <li> They are definitely worth the buying.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and durable and I swear my make-up looks better just from using them.</li>
            <li> They come in a nice bag you can use for storing or toting around, if necessary.</li>
            <li> My daughter says that it&#x27;s pretty cool.</li>
            <li> I bought them as a gift but was able to feel how soft they were.</li>
            <li> definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> So nice but the only thing I didn&#x27;t get was a foundation brush</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and hold shadow well - face, powder and foundation brushes are on par with items costing 4x or more</li>
            <li> Overall really nice brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> Gives my make up look more professional polished finish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just starting to get into more complex make-up routines and these have been a wonderful start.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it for a beginners brush kit.</li>
            <li> I feel like they make my makeup that much more natural looking.</li>
            <li> It is worth buying.</li>
            <li> Love the pouches, soft brushes.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny .</li>
            <li> Brushes were cheap, pouch was nothing more than plastic and the entire set had a funky odor, so I returned it.</li>
            <li> She was beyond thrilled and said the only problem was that she didn&#x27;t know what all the brushes were used for.  </li>
            <li> They come in a handy roll up leather like pouch; very convenient for taking with you for the weekend, they are soft and the bristles seem to be well attached.  </li>
            <li> Now, they&#x27;re a handy kit that I pull out when I&#x27;m feeling like doing some proper, fancy make-up.</li>
            <li> I love these soft brushes and recommend them to everyone.  </li>
            <li> Brushes are nice, but I wish they were labeled as to each brushes specific function.  </li>
            <li> I simply threw away the pouch since I had bought a nice makeup holder anyway.</li>
            <li> Im very happy with this set was definitely money well spent</li>
            <li> All in all, these are s***y brushes, not even worth playing with the dolls.</li>
            <li> They work good and there was a wide variety of brushes to use</li>
            <li> So far I love the brushes.</li>
            <li> In my option well worth the money.</li>
            <li> but it has a distinct odor I have not use it yet and have not wash yet</li>
            <li> Worth the price I paid.</li>
            <li> They have the kind of quality that I believe would last a while.</li>
            <li> While I have so many reservations about purchasing &#x27;natural&#x27; brushes, I couldn&#x27;t pass up on the deal.</li>
            <li> They are soft and I absolutely love.</li>
            <li> The only thing I liked is the brush holder.</li>
            <li> I really love this brushes they were more than what I expected.</li>
            <li> I love the selection and the brushes are soft.</li>
            <li> I love the natural brushes.</li>
            <li> Natural hair, which I find is so much better than synthetic.  </li>
            <li> Very good set for an unbelievable price!  </li>
            <li> When i first opened the package, I immediately smelled a strong chemical odor, like when you paint or like a really concentrated sharpie, so I took the brushes out of the case and put the case in my closet for a couple of days and the smell was gone.</li>
            <li> First of all, these really do smell quite strong</li>
            <li> /&gt;In conclusion, if you are looking for decent brushes that will get the job done, these will do just fine.</li>
            <li> Loved the brushes quality for such a great price who needs to spend $20 per brush or more these work just the same if not better.</li>
            <li> They came pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, from my experience thus far - this set is a decent deal price-wise, but it isn&#x27;t anything amazing.</li>
            <li> So not only are you getting a high quality product but your also getting a really good deal.  </li>
            <li> You guys know the pouch is probably made from puppies they hit over the head or cut their throats so they can skin them and make this product right?</li>
            <li> These arrived right on time (two day shipping).</li>
            <li> Shipped right away and with everything stated in description.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve finally found a winner- they haven&#x27;t shedded, they blend nicely, and they&#x27;re a good quality overall (so far)!</li>
            <li> This is my first set of professional makeup brushes and I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> very soft and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> The only con about them is they came in a leather pouch that smelled very strongly of chemicals and plastic.</li>
            <li> The only issue I had was the bag they are stored in had a very strong plastic/chemical smell when we opened it.</li>
            <li> One reviewer said there was a smell, I experienced very little smell.  </li>
            <li> but I did not like the many, many e-mails that I received from the seller after the purchase with the subject, &amp;</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the shadow brushes, which was my main reason for purchasing this particular set.</li>
            <li> I tried one brush and it applied smoothly and quickly - 100000x better than applicators that usually come free with make-up purchases.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are natural and the makeup goes on nice a smooth, the bristles have not fallen out even with extensive use.</li>
            <li> However, my first impression is that they were worth the price</li>
            <li> There has been no shedding as I&#x27;ve experienced with some brushes in the past.</li>
            <li> I would have to recommend these brushes to anyone who is looking into an affordable brush set that would also meet the expectations of any amateur or moderately experienced makeup user.</li>
            <li> other than that minor flaw its the best brush set I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> I considered giving 4 stars because the brushes are too long for my travel makeup bag, but since they come with their own travel case I haven&#x27;t found that to be an inconvenience.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty nice brushes for being so cheap I paid nearly 50 dollars for another set of brushed</li>
            <li> Wonderful for both theatrical and everyday use.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great for such a low price!</li>
            <li> U really don&#x27;t need more than these 12 brushes unless u r a professional makeup artist.</li>
            <li> Brushes are soft &amp; easy to work with.</li>
            <li> i am not big on makeup and am definitely no makeup artist, so these brushes work great for me.</li>
            <li> The pouch does have a strong smell of paint but aired out overnight.  </li>
            <li> Soft bristles and picks up product easily.</li>
            <li> I really only bought these for two specific brushes but all of them are great.</li>
            <li> just as described and shipped super fast thank you..</li>
            <li> Great quality especially for the low price I purchased them.</li>
            <li> Eye shadow brushes make application easy and professional looking.</li>
            <li> Since it comes with so many, I&#x27;ll just start using another brush, but if you&#x27;re a makeup pro, you might want to spend a little more for higher quality.</li>
            <li> I love this brush set and its so unbelievably cheap for such high quality.</li>
            <li> While they are very soft and provide smooth application, they also shed quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy how soft these brushes are!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know what to expect especially for so cheap, best brushes, I&#x27;ve used ever, now I wish I had gotten the bigger 32 brush set, my bare minerals brushes were not as nice as these, now I wonder if karity makes a kabuki brush, and BTW you just can&#x27;t beat bare minerals foundation matte ,actually i sleep in it!</li>
            <li> Item exactly as described - Super Fast Shipping</li>
            <li> I like these brushes very much.</li>
            <li> I like these brushes very much.</li>
            <li> So far These brushes are working fine</li>
            <li> Pretty great variety of decent brushes for little $</li>
            <li> Good for the price, but now the little bristles are coming off onto my face everytime</li>
            <li> Good product with little to no shedding.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and pretty!</li>
            <li> Comes in a pleather package, very sleek and modern!!</li>
            <li> She has been asking for new brushes and I was excited to find these.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The natural brush is the way to go because they hold more product &amp; the blending brush adds the professional touch!!</li>
            <li> When I first used them they shed a bit</li>
            <li> The brushes work pretty well for a beginner</li>
            <li> I will add to my review when I&#x27;ve had the chance to use them and given them their first cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My favorite part of these brushes are the smaller eyeshadow brushes, I found that some of my eyeshadows that don&#x27;t seem to go on with a lot of pigment seem renewed using these brushes.</li>
            <li> However, she likes the set so much, she is keeping them for herself!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was wanting.</li>
            <li> first time user of make up after taking make up</li>
            <li> My rating would have been higher</li>
            <li> So, the first time I washed these brushes after getting them, they bled a reddish color.</li>
            <li> First time user of make up and brushes are sufficient</li>
            <li> and I do still enjoy how soft they are.</li>
            <li> These brushes from a first impression remind me of the Morphe brushes.</li>
            <li> I love the eye brushes though I use them daily</li>
            <li> I think they will last more than a year.</li>
            <li> but they are better than you would get than from buying brushes from walmart at the same price.</li>
            <li> This is my first set of brushes that I bought all together instead of buying one here and one there.</li>
            <li> and I love all the different size options!  </li>
            <li> Truthfully, I only purchased this set because I wanted more brushes for applying eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> First brush set ever.</li>
            <li> but like I said, I don&#x27;t do make up often and don&#x27;t exactly know what I&#x27;m doing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly as depicted in the offering</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t going anywhere, just decided to try to use as many of the brushes as possible for the review.wasn&#x27;t going anywhere, just decided to try to use as many of the brushes as possible for the review.</li>
            <li> When they first were taken out of the box it smelled like they spray painted the case.</li>
            <li> It does more than enough for me</li>
            <li> I will provide more feedback later.</li>
            <li> this is my first set of makeup brushes</li>
            <li> They are exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> We used them right after we bought them for a large wedding party.  </li>
            <li> The bag for the brushes looks pretty.</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase from Karity and they didn&#x27;t disappoint.  </li>
            <li> There was a smell when they first arrived, but after a couple of days the smell dissipated.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend !!</li>
            <li> The larger brushes were more flexible than I like, and the fan brush had to be flatironed after washing.</li>
            <li> that said the brushes had a funny smell to it</li>
            <li> They look exactly like the picture</li>
            <li> I would most definitely recommend these brushes to anyone looking for makeup application!  </li>
            <li> My first brush set</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price but took a chance and was blown away by what came in the mail!</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to purchase makeup brushes :)</li>
            <li> Maybe now I can take up painting on the side ;)</li>
            <li> It came with more brushes than she can actually use.</li>
            <li> The brushes were exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> On a side note, the case they came in was pretty chemical smelling</li>
            <li> This is my first time using makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with any type of makeup brush.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a wide variety of brushes for all your needs, and they look pretty nice, too.</li>
            <li> The defining brushes work better &amp; apply makeup well enough.</li>
            <li> Exactly was was advertised.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s pretty picky about brushes.</li>
            <li> Very Niceeeee!</li>
            <li> Thanks u!</li>
            <li> First, let me say...</li>
            <li> Not expensive</li>
            <li> Pretty brushes.  </li>
            <li> Also they have an overwhelming chemical smell when you first open the bag,</li>
            <li> I only wish it came with more eyeshadow blending brushes...</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase on Amazon</li>
            <li> The bag smells funny.</li>
            <li> Love it especially the price!</li>
            <li> Just be aware of the smell.</li>
            <li> I put mine in a pretty glass container and threw away the bag.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I was able to purchase this set as a back up set</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> My daughter likes them so much she bought them for her friend!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a brush for absolutely everything!</li>
            <li> I love them especially for the price.</li>
            <li> This set of brushes would have been okay for the price if the brushes didn&#x27;t have such an odor - the odor had petroleum based  smell which may have been from the case - but even after washing the brushes retained that odor and made me unwilling to use them on my face.</li>
            <li> The lack of softness is more noticeable on the big brushes.</li>
            <li> I would be willing to try them again.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because of the price but these brushes are perfect !!!</li>
            <li> and i definitely recommend. :)</li>
            <li> and so it slid out within first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes!</li>
            <li> She said that she was glad that the brushes had individual sleeves inside of the carrying case to preserve their shapes.</li>
            <li> these bushes are much higher in price.  </li>
            <li> Even make up artist they ship fast and work just as great as the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I love the travel case and the fact that the bigger brushes come with plastic protectors for travel.</li>
            <li> Amazon sells much better quality brushes for the same price.</li>
            <li> These were the first makeup brushes ihave ever purchased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again :)</li>
            <li> The quality its exactly what i am looking for.</li>
            <li> The hair came out a lot my first couple times using them.  </li>
            <li> As another reviewer noted, the case had an odor when I first opened it.  </li>
            <li> Wash brushes &amp; air out case when you first get it.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves the brushes!  </li>
            <li> I really like these brushes!</li>
            <li> Thanks for meeting my expectations!</li>
            <li> Well, I can tell you exactly what these smell like- spray paint.</li>
            <li> The smell alone was enough to deter me from touching these brushes to my face.</li>
            <li> She loved the brushes and has been using them everyday since she got them.</li>
            <li> Bought these because of the good reviews and the few that said the names of the brushes were on the handles...</li>
            <li> other wise a decent value.</li>
            <li> They arrived with minimal packaging but the brush roll itself is lovely - a very attractive black and white pleather roll featuring the Karity logo with well-attached security</li>
            <li> these brushes blend good when half of their hair isnt falling off!</li>
            <li> About the smell, they really have a strong chemical smell, but I took them out the case and plastic and it seems worked so far.</li>
            <li> people will probably already own an extra large Kabuki powder brush in their battery of brushes, the long - handled one here is a good size, whilst not the same as a Kabuki it still gives generous coverage.</li>
            <li> I was very much looking forward to receiving these brushes, counting on the overwhelmingly positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Absolutely reek of chemicals right out package....</li>
            <li> unless you come up close you can&#x27;t even smell it and it&#x27;ll probably go away over some time but other than that its amazing.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great and soft and definitely worth the price :) I&#x27;ve used them everyday for a few weeks now and no problems so far :)</li>
            <li> She has since thrown out all her other brushes and is loving this set.</li>
            <li> I would compare them to some other Sephora brushes I own.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the second set of brushes I&#x27;ve used, the first being a Kirkland brand set (much softer; much more durable).</li>
            <li> Other than that the eyeshadow brushes are effective.</li>
            <li> The price was well worth it; the value was over $80 on the website fit the exact same product</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not a professional makeup artist these brushes will do just fine!</li>
            <li> I was shocked at the price and honestly did not expect it to be great</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty long from top to bottom, if that matters.  </li>
            <li> They smelled a little plastic-y from the brush holder, but other then that these are actually great!</li>
            <li> Super soft!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t lose bristles, and the brushes are super soft!</li>
            <li> Brushes are super soft!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super soft and work really well!</li>
            <li> They do have a strong smell when you open them for the first time, but the smell went away as soon as I washed them.</li>
            <li> the natural hair brushes are super soft!!!!</li>
            <li> It was also delivered pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Great for an amateur makeup artist or a professional!</li>
            <li> just strange. :)</li>
            <li> Smell at first, but that went away fast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I got what I paid for pretty much.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and full.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these brushes to anyone &amp; the price is right</li>
            <li> I washed them with my brush cleaning solution and wiped down the pouch it came in (which is nice pleather-ish material) and the smell went away.</li>
            <li> Though I have had only brief opportunity to make use of the brush set, the Karity Professional set appears to be excellent quality, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> I will most definitely be ordering more brushes again on the near future.</li>
            <li> They work well, are soft and clean nicely in warm water with a little soap.  </li>
            <li> Very strong smell as other reviewers noted but</li>
            <li> Some of the smaller brushes have strong yet supple qualities which make them ideal for applying more delicate and intricate forms of makeup in a non irritating, precise fashion.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about ordering them online but was so pleased once she received them!</li>
            <li> I really love the qualoyy of the brushes they are also very long</li>
            <li> These brushes are super soft and apply makeup well</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy enough to get used to.</li>
            <li> The folding case is fabulous, I&#x27;ve pretty much only used the eyebrow/eyelash brush, the eyeshadow brush and the angled contouring brush.</li>
            <li> bristles are super soft and no shedding!&lt;br /&gt;The pouch does have an odor</li>
            <li> super soft bristles even though they look hoarse</li>
            <li> They do not shed when using and are super soft.</li>
            <li> Others begin to lose hair rather quickly, but these have stood up well so far.</li>
            <li> Super soft.</li>
            <li> I ended up sending them back because it was too strong to give as a gift to my mother in law.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that the case does have a strong smell to it</li>
            <li> The length precludes me from carrying any of these around in my daily arsenal of tricks, BUT for fancy nights the length is a good thing since you are supposed to use long brushes, holding them from the furthest point to keep from over applying</li>
            <li> I received the brushes today and As I ripped the envelope they were mailed in, I got a sudden wiff of a strong odor.</li>
            <li> The only thing that bothered me was the strong smell.</li>
            <li> I dont think I have used a single one more than once.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are large and sturdy.  </li>
            <li> Been using them for a few weeks now and absolutely love them!</li>
            <li> I love my new brush set definitely recommend !</li>
            <li> I figured for the price I would give them a try since my old set was pretty pricey and not in my budget right now.</li>
            <li> They seem to have a nice tight hold on the bristles themselves.</li>
            <li> High quality for very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> the face brushes aren&#x27;t my favorite, they&#x27;re constantly shedding and they aren&#x27;t very soft.</li>
            <li> The smaller brushes ate fine.</li>
            <li> I left it close to a window to get some air and after a day or two, it was fine.</li>
            <li> The brush handles look like they&#x27;re made of some pretty decent quality and</li>
            <li> These brushes seem to be pretty decent quality</li>
            <li> Very high quality.</li>
            <li> These were very high quality for the price.  </li>
            <li> Very high quality.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to do my makeup one single time without finding bristles stuck to my face!</li>
            <li> The largest one is just not stiff enough to really apply powder very well; I wish it was just a tad bit better.</li>
            <li> and I really like them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li> So much more than I expected for the cost.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast too.</li>
            <li> and she seems to really like them.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> &#x60;I know absolutely nothing about makeup and the act of applying it</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and item as described.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> I bought them for my daughter and she really enjoys them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use the lash/brow comb, I prefer a spoolie for my brows &amp; my Tweezerman lash comb for lashes, so I can&#x27;t comment on that.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and my niece loves them.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience with makeup brushes</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I like these brushes a lot as they blend my makeup very well, without it looking caked on.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes.  </li>
            <li> but for its price , theyre better than expected .</li>
            <li> They arrived fast.  </li>
            <li> I really like how the brushes apply my makeup</li>
            <li> the brushes had to be cleaned very well and one came apart while cleaning...</li>
            <li> I was not expecting much because of the price</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this set!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup very often</li>
            <li> Was given as a gift to my daughter and she absolutely loves them.</li>
            <li> really looking forward to pampering myself.</li>
            <li> I apologize that the light and angle weren&#x27;t the same (that damn sun keeps moving!!!)</li>
            <li> Alas it&#x27;s not that great of a product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Get what you pay for really.</li>
            <li> And I really like the pouch.</li>
            <li> They do not work very well.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush set for my roommate for Christmas because she needed a set, and she absolutely loves them.</li>
            <li> They work very well for applying makeup.  </li>
            <li> i really like these brushes for the price</li>
            <li> Really like the set.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the leather smell doesn&#x27;t bother me too much</li>
            <li> and I actually really like the case</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Much better quality than expected for this price.</li>
            <li> they are better than I expected</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like these Brushes.</li>
            <li> She absolutely LOVES them.</li>
            <li> These brushes were so much nicer than the picture.</li>
            <li> Cleaning with a mixture of dish soap and olive oil works really well, it doesn&#x27;t make them lose additional bristles.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> but these brushes are very hit and miss.</li>
            <li> They shed after about three washes and they applied everything that was powder very patchy.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Item(s) arrived fast and as described.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really pick up these brushes as much as I would like.</li>
            <li> so much</li>
            <li> The bristles stay in the brush and are gentle to use.</li>
            <li> They work very well</li>
            <li> but I really like it.</li>
            <li> case is convenient to have but very stinky plastic.</li>
            <li> I really like the brushes, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say much as to how they stand up over time.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I would like to add two thumbs up for fast shipping.</li>
            <li> and I really like the eyeshadow</li>
            <li> mind much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;they are very soft,&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li> its very nice&lt;br /&gt;i can recommend it all my friends whose using make ups ,&lt;br /&gt;its 100% satisfaction guarantee,some brush that i have been use its make me itch,but this one is really make me feel so comptable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The brushes work very well.</li>
            <li> I really have the concern</li>
            <li> I really like the fan brush and the blush brushes.</li>
            <li> and I ordered myself a set given the reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my daughter and she absolutely loves them.</li>
            <li> Better then expected when I opened the box.</li>
            <li> Amazon should really invest in it considering some of the products they endorse.</li>
            <li> These brushes should cost three times as much.  </li>
            <li> I really like them.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes</li>
            <li> I like the fact that the brushes grab the power really well.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for my daughter, she really likes them.</li>
            <li> Wife really loves these and was amazed at the price</li>
            <li> so this kit really comes in</li>
            <li> I really like the brushes</li>
            <li> in all Im very</li>
            <li> This was given as a gift and was very well received.  </li>
            <li> More than I expected.  </li>
            <li> They are not plastic, they are real wood.  </li>
            <li> The case wasn&#x27;t real leather.</li>
            <li> Real hair.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes and the case it comes in.  </li>
            <li> I really like this set.</li>
            <li> And not so much to hinder my application, just a nuisance if anything.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have everything you&#x27;ll want, and the quality is better than expected for the price.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes.</li>
            <li> should anyone really need that</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive for what you get.</li>
            <li> set.&lt;br /&gt;The carrying wrap bag is a plus and very convenient.</li>
            <li> This set is fantastic for personal use.</li>
            <li> For the price, you get what you need, plus a better quality than expected.</li>
            <li> Not to mention their fast delivery</li>
            <li> They work really well</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, as well.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these brushes!</li>
            <li> and she absolutely lives them.</li>
            <li> Of course I did not wash them, but I can&#x27;t imagine that washing them would change much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this product three stars instead of two because the smaller brushes work as expected and the price of the set is good for what you get.</li>
            <li> For the same price,in a department store, you only have five medium quality brushes,i hesitated,went home to Amazon,and of course i found a pouch of 12 fines,well organized soft,good quality brushes,to apply all kind of make up,some of them i don&#x27;t even know,how to use them</li>
            <li> when i recieved the brush i immediately check attachment of the brush to its wooden handle, because as what i&#x27;ve read about the reviews most of the comment was the brush is not firmly attached to the handle.</li>
            <li> I am not a makeup artist, but I do like nice brushes - they make such a difference especially for eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li> It goes away after a few days, but it&#x27;s pretty strong when you first get them!</li>
            <li> As a previous reviewer said, they had a VERY STRONG CHEMICAL SMELL when I got them in the mail.</li>
            <li> I would have liked a more firm powder brush, but for this price I&#x27;m certainly not complaining.</li>
            <li> These brushes are truly professional!!!</li>
            <li> Very rarely do you get quality at a low price.  </li>
            <li> My other professional brushes are far superior.</li>
            <li> These are quality brushes that have held up very nicely for the last few months.</li>
            <li> If you like the hairs on the brush to be very thin and light this will be good for you.</li>
            <li> The smell of the cases were a little strong but went away quickly after opening (leathery smell; not offensive).</li>
            <li> They are easy to work with because they are long.</li>
            <li> I was told the eye brushes were decent but the bigger brushes were cheap.</li>
            <li> Nice variety of brushes, large and small.  </li>
            <li> The different eye make - up brushes enable unique designs.</li>
            <li> It is okay except some brushes were made with other materials.</li>
            <li> I will purchase a better quality foundation brush and continue to use the other brushes in the kit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a set that I would use while saving money for a higher end set or individual brushes of better quality such as from the MAC line.</li>
            <li> This is better than I expected!</li>
            <li> Having NO CLUE in the WORLD what to look for in a makeup brush, of course I asked my daughter and gave her several (what appeared to be high quality) sets available here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> They are high quality and much better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I figured it out on my own, but an small instruction book would have been appreciated.</li>
            <li> My daily routine doesn&#x27;t much involve brushes, but I decided to get a full brush kit.</li>
            <li> They have a pretty strong plastic smell when first opened but just let them air out a few days</li>
            <li> They are decent if you don&#x27;t want to spend too much money.</li>
            <li> My grand daughter is active in all her community plays</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why these brushes have such great reviews.</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice and soft although I thought they were a little too large.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I found was there are so many different brushes, most I won&#x27;t use, but then I&#x27;m not really into make-up</li>
            <li> The carrying case feels and looks high quality and sports a sort of worn leather look which feels very premium given the affordable price.</li>
            <li> Received very fast even during the busy holiday season.</li>
            <li> : wash them before using the first time, it will ensure you&#x27;re using a clean brush get rid of any loose hairs.</li>
            <li> But overall I feel their performance for the price is right on point!</li>
            <li> These brushes aren&#x27;t super soft but soft enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used 2 for seldom times but loved them none the less.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I will be using a professional set of makeup brushes....</li>
            <li> I had whole set of Bobbi brown and MAC brushs, but this set of brush just as awesome as those expensive brushes as they create the same result.</li>
            <li> This is my first complete set of brushes</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive about smells like me be aware of this problem</li>
            <li> I like big full brushes, and these ones are not quite full enough.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time using professional brushes.  </li>
            <li> I had to hang the set outside for a full 24 hours to air it out before use.</li>
            <li> Some of the brushes, we&#x27;re not sure what they&#x27;re for, but nice quality.</li>
            <li> i have no fault with them so far not a wrong buy.</li>
            <li> Overall not a bad starter set of brushes.</li>
            <li> The bigger brushes came with plastic protectors, which I thought was a very smart idea to keep those things in shape!</li>
            <li> Can not beat the price for these soft, professional looking brushes!!!!  </li>
            <li> The large powder brush lost quite a few bristles, but not so many that I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> it folds up easily and needs minimal storage.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re decent for the price.</li>
            <li> if you prefer to use a fan brush to apply blusher then this one would be a decent pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What wasn&#x27;t okay was the constant harrassment from the company until I left a review.</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves are decent.  </li>
            <li> I mainly use the foundation and blush brushes.</li>
            <li> Decent quality brushes for the price</li>
            <li> the brushes are decent quality and do what they need to do.</li>
            <li> Worth the buy for the extra money we saved and the time saved with her getting ready to go places</li>
            <li> I have actually lost 2 in this short time but uts ok.</li>
            <li> They did the job decent.</li>
            <li> The brushes feel soft but they don&#x27;t pick up much product and they don&#x27;t put much product on your face.</li>
            <li> The brushes were surprisingly decent for the price.</li>
            <li> I just received these brushes and have not even used yet - but wanted to leave a review that they definitely feel and appear worthy of the reviews that encouraged me to buy them.  </li>
            <li> The quality is good and they last through some heavy usage.</li>
            <li> Such a super price too.</li>
            <li> The bristles come out constantly, and they don&#x27;t provide a super even coverage.</li>
            <li> Decent set of brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> Will definitely purchase more affordable sets from this seller in the future!!</li>
            <li> The price was unbeatable :) Will definitely look to Karity Cosmetics for beauty supplies I may need in the future!</li>
            <li> Its nice to have such a wide array of brushes at my disposal.  </li>
            <li> They pick up product very well and the brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li> When taking the brush set out of the box, which was very neatly packaged by the way, WOW, I was hit with an over powering chemical smell!  </li>
            <li> Very soft!  </li>
            <li> I had Sephora brushes before and was ready for a set with a bigger variety but still real hair (which are hard to find for a good price).</li>
            <li> but none of the fibers have come loose and the coverage is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Warning: These do have a strong smell when you first buy them but take it out of the plastic for a few hours and its practically gone.</li>
            <li> High quality and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these</li>
            <li> and she said they were high quality</li>
            <li> high quality.</li>
            <li> She noted how high quality the brushes were, commenting on the balanced weight and fineness of the hairs for even distribution.</li>
            <li> These brushes are high quality, I ordered them for my mom</li>
            <li> looks high end but got it for fraction of a price.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Truly like them and would recommend highly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> High quality brushes.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 sets and would highly recommend these brushes to anyone.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> She like high quality brushes too...</li>
            <li> highly recommended</li>
            <li> I was looking for a variety of makeup brushes, but didn&#x27;t want to pay the high prices.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Seemed to be high quality brushes.</li>
            <li> These brushes provide both and are highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this kit to anyone</li>
            <li> I usually spend $20 to $30 dollars on single brushes and these work just as great .</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the bag has a strong paint/chemical smell- which I&#x27;m sure will go away.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my mom, and while she likes them just fine (she&#x27;s never used make up brushes before), I found the bristles in these brushes rough on the skin, and they fall out from time to time.</li>
            <li> Had to retun these due to a strong pungent petroleum smell.</li>
            <li> They are soft and the makeup stays on the brushes very well.</li>
            <li> They look and feel like real professional brushes.</li>
            <li> The bristles have stayed in really well so far.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and soft bristles.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and professional attitude.</li>
            <li> Bristles are soft, but hold up very well to pressure and use.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft, I have never been much into being high-maintanence with my makeup</li>
            <li> The brushes were very well made and presented in the case with a professional look.</li>
            <li> and I really wished the brushes were marked</li>
            <li> That would have been very helpful for someone that has never used professional brushes before.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally wear makeup</li>
            <li> This set is a lot bigger from what I imagined from the picture, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I hope it will last a long time :)</li>
            <li> Worth the price, definitely.</li>
            <li> the quality is ok for everyday.</li>
            <li> I use them everyday for a few months now and they are holding up beautifully.</li>
            <li> The only rush that was useful was the fanned brush.</li>
            <li> While she said that the carrying bag they come in was pretty generic, she didn&#x27;t really care about that.</li>
            <li> The black and white color looks nice.</li>
            <li> The brushes are lovely - very soft and definitely not cheaply made.</li>
            <li> The price was right and the brushes work well with any of the brands I currently use.</li>
            <li> Wish there was a medium/large brush, but other than that it&#x27;s fantastic</li>
            <li> The other brushes are fantastic.</li>
            <li> One fall, and my eyebrow brush is losing its bristles, all over my newly made face, due to cheap and brittle plastic.  </li>
            <li> would recommend for a gift to someone who is new at make up.</li>
            <li> I live it to</li>
            <li> It works so well with my new set of make up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite new to make-up application and decided to purchase a set of brushes.  </li>
            <li> My wife has been bugging me to let her spend an arm and a leg on new brushes from Sephora.</li>
            <li> but I needed some new brushes.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m new at this and have just been watching YouTube videos to learn.)</li>
            <li> They are nice quality, but a few bristles are falling out after only a month.</li>
            <li> They sent me three separate emails asking me to leave one, which I initially didn&#x27;t do because I really haven&#x27;t used these brushes all that much.</li>
            <li> At least those won&#x27;t shed as much and are much much much much more softer than the course finish of these brushes.</li>
            <li> They are very soft on your skin and apply my makeup evenly.</li>
            <li> The bristle does not fall and feels very soft on the skin.</li>
            <li> These are very soft quality brushes.</li>
            <li> Very soft.  </li>
            <li> These are high quality, professional brushes without a doubt.</li>
            <li> She was very surprised by my surprise gift.</li>
            <li> I warn you about a distinctive smell to it as some people are very sensitive to smelly makeup products but</li>
            <li> Very soft with no shedding and</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft as well.</li>
            <li> She loves them, very professional.</li>
            <li> she has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Very soft.  </li>
            <li> They are very soft and the hair does not fall off.</li>
            <li> There high quality and the brush hairs are soft but sturdy.  </li>
            <li> It has very soft, but sturdy bristles.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very soft, and I like how they&#x27;re sovkight weight.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are very soft.  </li>
            <li> Handles are long enough to use easily unlike some of.</li>
            <li> Soft; easy to clean;bristles stay put...really nice for the price..you cannot go wrong here!</li>
            <li> Well made and so soft!</li>
            <li> Absolutely awesome trust you won&#x27;t be disappointed if you purchase them.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> My 15 year old niece loves them!</li>
            <li> There was no shedding of hairs on the initial wash but the powder brush is starting to shed significantly while using it.</li>
            <li> No need to buy the $200.00 brushes when this one is so affordable and works exactly the same!!!!</li>
            <li> To me, makeup brush bristles should maintain shape especially after its first wash of cleaning.</li>
            <li> and they didn&#x27;t even last through their first wash.</li>
            <li> They do have a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; smell when you first open them</li>
            <li> I am not sure why the foundation brush does this, but for $11, it&#x27;s not terrible.</li>
            <li> this is what exactly i needed for daily use</li>
            <li> Brushes are soft and they work well!</li>
            <li> I am not sure why so many people are raving about them.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so convenient I feel like taking it everywhere, the brushes are soft and all as described!</li>
            <li> They are professional and all my friends thought I must have paid a fortune for them!</li>
            <li> They are better then Mac and other big name brushes!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not excessive.  </li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft!</li>
            <li> My favorite is the small angled brush, I use it for concealer under by brows, its great!!&lt;br /&gt;The brushes blend well, and dont dust away my blush or powders when I use them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do love the small tapered brushes and the eyeshadow brushes.</li>
            <li> But so far, no problems, and she loves them!</li>
            <li> I would only suggest discarding the carrying case which has a significant plastic smell, but if you&#x27;ll use it air it out outside for a bit.</li>
            <li> The bristles are nice and soft, but are firm enough to blend contouring makeup and eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> However, one of the brushes came apart the first time using it and the others loose &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; a little more the I would like.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say how they compare to more expensive brands, but they work for me and the price was right!</li>
            <li> Kind of weird, chemically smell to them at first</li>
            <li> far better brushes than anything iv bought in the past and for the price</li>
            <li> The brushes are natural and very soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot of brushes for the money and the brushes I have used so far (powder, blush, 2 eyeshadow, eye liner) are very soft.</li>
            <li> The brushes have held up well for the most part, but after 6 months of use some little hairs are falling out of the bigger brushes and they also are not as soft as some other cheap brushes that I have.</li>
            <li> I am still enjoying the brushes and they appear to be made well and will likely last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have one very expensive makeup brush and these are just as good!  </li>
            <li> I wash them after each use before I put them away, but make sure they are fully dry before use (the bristles will clump together when wet).</li>
            <li> I love the black and white handles.</li>
            <li> I love the black and white.</li>
            <li> Not ready to give up my super soft mac kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> The travel case is a little stinky, but it was fine after I aired it out.</li>
            <li> She uses them almost every day and has pretty much relegated her other brushes to the bottom drawer of shame.</li>
            <li> I am no expert in make up brushes but these seem to be fine, did not come apart on soaking in soap water for a few hours,</li>
            <li> Another thing is that they seem to only have medium, large and x-large shadow brushes.</li>
            <li> The large shadow brush looks and feel different.</li>
            <li> was a little worried to buy them from the cheap price</li>
            <li> Most of the eyeshadow ones are hard to use and they leave a log of hair while using them.</li>
            <li> Very high quality, I was not expecting such quality given the price point</li>
            <li> I had very high hopes for these brushes, despite the very low price.</li>
            <li> Nice set but bigger brushes are hard &amp; shed a lot.</li>
            <li> (Just because Im very picky), maybe have more color selections to choose from other than black?</li>
            <li> The natural brush heads are soft and sensitive on the skin.</li>
            <li> Maybe like girly colors like pink, light blue or purple</li>
            <li> even months after it has become clear that you have no desire to.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical on buying because of the mixed reviews but this is really a great set.  </li>
            <li> but I am happily surprised.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a makeup professional, so</li>
            <li> So soft and gives you the look of a professional make up artist.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had much need to actually use the set</li>
            <li> It is made of natural hair.</li>
            <li> Soft.</li>
            <li> My daughter is a professional performer and she loves these brushes.</li>
            <li> She was so surprised and the product&#x27;s work well.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the brushes.</li>
            <li> Bought these as a replacement for my old brushes.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how soft the brushes were.</li>
            <li> Gift for my 14 year old granddaughter.</li>
            <li> so I just took one from my old set.</li>
            <li> I have never had natural brushes before.</li>
            <li> the brushes are soft and don&#x27;t shed</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t MAC type soft</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft and don&#x27;t seem to shed.  </li>
            <li> Bought these for my 15 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> and the bristles are soft</li>
            <li> They are soft and don&#x27;t leave residue hairs all over.</li>
            <li> Bristles are soft, but the smell of plastic taste too.</li>
            <li> They are sturdy and soft.</li>
            <li> Ordered as a gift for a professional makeup artist.</li>
            <li> but i surprised my wife with them</li>
            <li> This is a thing with &#x27;professional brushes, and how you are supposed to hold them for application, so it&#x27;s not a slam on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Brushes are soft and wash well.</li>
            <li> Brush bristles fall out frequently.</li>
            <li> so much bought several for gifts!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a soft touch for a soft touch;  I wish I had ordered this set for gifts for friends....</li>
            <li> The brushes aren&#x27;t too course or soft and hold the makeup well.</li>
            <li> She says the&#x27;re soft and apply evenly.</li>
            <li> no bristle shedding so far.</li>
            <li> These brushes are soft and apply the makeup well, but they smell like chemicals and shed like you wouldn&#x27;t believe.</li>
            <li> Wow, I have now a complete set of make up brush without slashing my wallet.  </li>
            <li> It also helps keep them soft when I wash them with baby shampoo.</li>
            <li> No shedding and they are so soft.</li>
            <li> The brushes work well and are really soft on your face.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know if my 22 year old will like or not</li>
            <li> They are soft, they don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my 16 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> The hair of brushes are not as soft as I</li>
            <li> She can now throw away the really old brushes she has had for years.</li>
            <li> they are so soft.</li>
            <li> I bouth this brushes because a would like exchange my old ones.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re incredibly soft for being synthetic brushes.</li>
            <li> I have complete control placing makeup where I want it to be applied.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m really surprised with the quality.</li>
            <li> They are soft and hold the powder and quality made.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft and they get the job done well.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re extremely soft.</li>
            <li> The bristles don&#x27;t shed and they maintain their shape after cleaning (using cleanser for natural bristles).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I haven&#x27;t been using professional brushes sooner.  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m a beginner and far from being a pro, I decided to start with those brushes.</li>
            <li> Soft against your skin, well made.</li>
            <li> No shedding so far, bristles are soft.</li>
            <li> These brushes are soft on the skin and make applying makeup pleasurable.</li>
            <li> The brushes are really soft.</li>
            <li> needs to be thoroughly aired out before using.</li>
            <li> The only issue I had was the smell, but all I&#x27;ll need to do is wash them once before use, so that really isn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
            <li> These are professional quality affordable make up brushes that are an alternative to some of the high-end brands.</li>
            <li> After a week or so, however, the bristles come out too frequently.</li>
            <li> Brushes are to soft to even blend anything</li>
            <li> They are soft and put the makeup on evenly.</li>
            <li> The brushes are SO soft and don&#x27;t have a smell really, as far as the packaging and the pouch there was bubble wrap</li>
            <li> The smell is completely like plastic.  </li>
            <li> I gave them to my 16 yr old daughter</li>
            <li> what chemical they used it here with such a smell and really believe that can be harmful to the health.  </li>
            <li> i get so busy.</li>
            <li> I like the variety and quality, the professional look and feel of these.  </li>
            <li> so I aired them out in my living room before using.</li>
            <li> She feels like she is getting a professional makeup application each time she uses them.</li>
            <li> They are professional quality and</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t pick up powders very well especially if you want to use them to apply blush or bronzer</li>
            <li> I use these as a professional for weddings and every day use.</li>
            <li> So soft and do not shed.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my adult daughter</li>
            <li> My eyeshadow especially looks much smoother and even then before.  </li>
            <li> It is not made of natural hair.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something that feels soft like silk over your cheeks, keep looking.</li>
            <li> The bag is plastic not leather, the brushes stink and they are a cheap harsh fiber...</li>
            <li> If your looking for a professional grade makeup brush set this is not the set you want.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and hold the powders well.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my 15 year old cousin.</li>
            <li> Soft, and none of the hairs come out.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for, a complete set, soft brushes that actulally do the job.</li>
            <li> The only other thing is that I noticed the bigger foundation, blush, and contouring brushes shed quite significantly the first couple of times I used them.</li>
            <li> even if you have sensitive skin (like me) bag has kinda an overwleming smell tho</li>
            <li> As a professional photographer I look for both value and consistency in the application of makeup for models.</li>
            <li> There is every size you would need for a professional looking makeup application.</li>
            <li> Bristles were really soft.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very convenient for on the go (added an extra star for that).</li>
            <li> and so far I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> bought this set as a gift for my 15 yr old-</li>
            <li> I ended up giving the set to my 7 year old daughter to play with.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t shed at all and are really soft.</li>
            <li> I had read a few reviews about cheap makeup brushes smelling like chemicals.</li>
            <li> If I bought all of these brushes at a regular store, they&#x27;d be at least double the price, so it&#x27;s a good deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They differ by structure a tiny bit, but size wise, none of the eye brushes are small enough for small and smooth</li>
            <li> There was an odor when I first opened it, but that went away within the first few days.</li>
            <li> And so many essential brush types are missing.</li>
            <li> the feel of these brushes is nice but they leave alot of broken bristles.</li>
            <li> I ordered these on sale, expecting them to be mediocre, but they are honestly so good.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with good quality brushes for the low😝😁</li>
            <li> Good set for beginners for the price, but the fibers are itchy, feel scratchy, and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I wish the was one more with tight, flat bristles</li>
            <li> These bristles are a bit more stiff and coarse than the synthetic that I am used to, but I like the firmness when applying my makeup.</li>
            <li> I really had trouble finding the right brushes for the look I want to produce.</li>
            <li> But she was spending money left and right on different makeup applicators.</li>
            <li> Well made brushes for very little money, they came very quickly.</li>
            <li> however, there is an odor when they are first opened (like dry erase markers) but with a wash or two, that goes away completely.</li>
            <li> The quality is also good as none of the brushes had any loose heads, as I have seen reported on other brushes in other reviews.</li>
            <li> They work extremely well and totally make a huge difference in makeup application/</li>
            <li> First Impression- When i opened it they smelled like cement, i washed them and let them air dry.</li>
            <li> The bigger brushes are okay, but the smaller eyeshadow brushes (which is what I really needed) are scratchy and pick up very little pigment.</li>
            <li> Edit: Just notices that the company describes these as being of \\&quot;quality natural hair\\&quot; in the first product description and then writes farther down that \\&quot;The brushes are made from a combination of natural hair and synthetic hair for lasting performance, so they are soft and silky on top, yet firm and durable on the bottom.\\&quot; \\&quot;Soft and silky\\</li>
            <li> They arrived earlier than I thought, they are truly high quality, and the packaging was professional as well.</li>
            <li> It looks very professional, and the brushes are very soft, and the handles are solid.</li>
            <li> Overall the brushes were of decent quality.</li>
            <li> I when I first received the brushed they came individually wrapped in the roll case.</li>
            <li> It does have a slight plastic smell when you first open it, but after it was out it open, it went away quickly.</li>
            <li> i wish it had more small brushes then having three big ones</li>
            <li> Overall a decent set of brushes, though.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with the head becoming displaced from the stem like other users, but the brush hairs have begun to fall out left and right.</li>
            <li> High quality brushes for a low price.</li>
            <li> These are such high quality brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes are high quality, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> I bought these because they had such high reviews.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and these brushes are soft enough to not irritate my skin at all, plus it has every brush I needed and wanted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the brushes daily for a couple months and have seen no negative signs of wear.</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I will recommend washing them before using, only because they have a scent, but that&#x27;s normal.    </li>
            <li> but I expected a higher quality.</li>
            <li> Brushes are exactly what i expected.</li>
            <li> The brushes are fine if you only plan to use them at home, only, but they are too long to carry for daily maintenance or application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The little pouch did have a funky smell to it upon arrival, but it quickly went away.</li>
            <li> , both the brushes and the bag have the very sharp smell of synthetic materials and although I put them in front of fresh air for some days, the smell still remains.</li>
            <li> I would recommend them to anyone who does primarily use liquid or cream cosmetics, with only a few powder cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush set to replace an older one, my previous set had much softer bristled brushes.</li>
            <li> A good investment for few years at least.</li>
            <li> Two brushes have come off at the metal end from the wood end, but a little glue fixed that right up.</li>
            <li> They are very soft , however, they did have a smell similar to nail polish remover, but it wasn&#x27;t a smell that lasted after you have cleaned them .</li>
            <li> I really love these brushes they have every brush from a tiny detail brush to big and fluffy one that blen!</li>
            <li> I was hoping to get that single brush replaced, but the company actually refunded me the whole purchase!</li>
            <li> I really love how soft they are and mine hardly had any loose hair after washing them.</li>
            <li> Some loose hairs came out the first couple times I used them, but it was no big offense.</li>
            <li> Also, this exact set retails for $85 or something on their website, I am not sure if this is realistic price</li>
            <li> I have had some pretty bad brushes in my lifetime, these are amazing.</li>
            <li> They work well for their general purpose.</li>
            <li> They seem to be very well made and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> She recently started professional make up school</li>
            <li> Bought these brushes as a birthday present for a 12 year old girl that loves makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not applying product harshly (no one should), so I don&#x27;t understand why they come out with such ease...</li>
            <li> So far I have only used 2 brushes.</li>
            <li> I reviewed this some time back in early May, I know because it was before I would be traveling.</li>
            <li> , they are soft and made well enough.</li>
            <li> Please note these were bought for personal use not for professional use.</li>
            <li> soft enough esp</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and don&#x27;t feel cheap and sharp like some of the other similar packages on Amazon.</li>
            <li> So far they have not left any brush hairs on me as i am putting make up on.</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves are ok, not great, but usable.</li>
            <li> The case doesn&#x27;t look as expensive or nice as the brushes themselves</li>
            <li> I ordered them mainly for the smaller brushes to use with eye shadows and for blending since I prefer synthetic for foundation, but in this case I found the natural hairs to be of a lesser quality than expected - course and wild!</li>
            <li> the first day some brittles came loose, but after that and after even washing them a couple times there is no major brittle loss.</li>
            <li> I have several different brushes and these are just as good as the high end expensive ones!</li>
            <li> Definitely 5 stars all the way, if you are relatively new to makeup brushes like me than I would definitely recommend this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pure spray paint.&lt;br /&gt;I opened the box because there were other items that I had ordered in it.</li>
            <li> Mine had no strong odors, and I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to that.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t actually expect them to be as great due to the price I paid for them, but boy, was I wrong.</li>
            <li> There was a slight laquer odor when they first arrived.</li>
            <li> No loose hairs.</li>
            <li> Much nicer than I expected!</li>
            <li> little extra cash for two day shipping was so worth it.</li>
            <li> I only used it once, but overall it was really soft and does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> I left the brushes open for a week and it seemed to help, but I don&#x27;t see the smell going away completely.</li>
            <li> I would recommend the brushes to my friends they are really soft and feel more expensive than they were.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given them a few months and a few cleanings to see if it would get better, but it hasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Even after washing they still remained soft and did not shed, unlike my more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> The brushes were kind of rough and irritating to the skin.</li>
            <li> The other facial brushes do shed, especially when you first use them.</li>
            <li> The case was a little bit stinky at first, but over time that went away.</li>
            <li> The brushes smelled a little funny but let them sit out</li>
            <li> This brush set was purchased as a gift for my teen aged granddaughter who participates in competitive dance and is a pom pom girl at her high school.</li>
            <li> They are going right in the garbage for I am past the return deadline.</li>
            <li> It is all natural but the brushes don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The leather from the brush holder is high quality, you can just tell.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are so soft but firm enough to get the makeup on your face too.</li>
            <li> Used daily for several weeks already with no loose bristles.</li>
            <li> These brushes pick up product very well, are soft but firm, the ends are not plastic and long, and they come with bristle protectors.</li>
            <li> Brushes have a sort of &amp;#34;petroleum&amp;#34; smell when package first opened (see others&#x27; remarks), but goes away if left open to air after a few days.</li>
            <li> The bag does have a smell when you first get it, like some other reviews have stated...almost like wet paint.</li>
            <li> After heavy use on the large brush it&#x27;s been losing some bristles, however that could just be me</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the product came smelling quite strongly of the warehouse or wherever it was stored but it aired out after a few days.</li>
            <li> The price is what really sets them apart, at a little over a dollar a piece...</li>
            <li> As a few have stated, I noticed bristles have fallen out; but only on the large powder/kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> and she said she bought very expensive brushes before but this one is top quality i highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how they have such positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I have been using these brushes for the past few weeks and they seem to be pretty high quality.</li>
            <li> A little rough at first</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and a great product, you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> After using these brushes i cant use any other they&#x27;re soft and it spreads the makeup on</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had them for very long and they are already starting to need to be replaced, especially the larger brushes.</li>
            <li> soon as my new stash of fave cosmetics arrive I will get back into doing my face after a few years hiatus.</li>
            <li> The large powder brush is very harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a single brush at the local Family Dollar store for $3.</li>
            <li> It came on time, some of the small brushes are very efficient to apply eye shadow.</li>
            <li> My only concern is the bag they come in smells really strange.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t bother me and didn&#x27;t last too long.  </li>
            <li> As long as you take care of these brushes they will last.</li>
            <li> I seriously felt sick just touching them, because the smell was SO STRONG.</li>
            <li> The brushes weren&#x27;t very soft and the bristles fell out a little.</li>
            <li> I think these will last a long time!</li>
            <li> Only complaint is the smell of the case it smells very chemically</li>
            <li> The brushes are ok, the bag smells terrible and feels cheap.</li>
            <li> And I haven&#x27;t bought brush cleaner, but I used regular antibacterial dial soap and they were still soft after they dried.</li>
            <li> These are still soft on my skin, my only issue is that I have been using them for a few weeks now and some of the bristles are falling out.</li>
            <li> I have only used a few so far</li>
            <li> Only a few hairs falling from the contour brush after the first few months.</li>
            <li> I rubbed it along the back of my hand a bit to get all the loose pieces out and</li>
            <li> Not very soft.</li>
            <li> The brushes loose their bristles when using the larger brushes.</li>
            <li> If you wanna buy something less expensive but better quality, go for Elf brushes especially their studio line which are $3 each.</li>
            <li> The only thing I will agree with several other customers.</li>
            <li> but they are not as soft as I thought and they shed little hairs.</li>
            <li> In fact, for several years, I would merely use my clean fingertips to apply makeup.</li>
            <li> An unbelievable price for this high quality brush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, other than the complaints I had, this is a decent set for a beginner or for someone who is on a tight budget.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an owner of both expensive brushes and really cheap brushes.</li>
            <li> The long handle gives the feeling of easier grip and use.</li>
            <li> so you might have to leave it out for a few days to get aired out.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s just a minor point.</li>
            <li> They are not soft at all.  </li>
            <li> The handles are a bit long and I like to be all up in the mirror</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyhow, I am not surprised.</li>
            <li> but they are not soft....</li>
            <li> so long I can&#x27;t take them with me.</li>
            <li> I bought this cosmetic brush set a few weeks ago, and I have no complaints so far.</li>
            <li> Way earlier than i expected and when I opened the packaging, there was an oder</li>
            <li> Brushes are not soft.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a wide variety of tips and shapes for everything you could possibly want to put on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s been hinting to this for so long.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t need any kits for a long time.</li>
            <li> She not a professional at makeup</li>
            <li> So be prepared to air it out a few days if you&#x27;re sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li> The handles of the brushes are long; about 6 or 7 inches.</li>
            <li> it is how long the brushes are.</li>
            <li> they are kinda long</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t been using them long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for brushes for a long time, and I saw these brushes while browsing through amazon  and</li>
            <li> The brushes are not soft.</li>
            <li> They have soft bristles and are not cheap looking.  </li>
            <li> Minor shedding.</li>
            <li> They fall apart whIle using them and are absolutely not soft at all.</li>
            <li> I do wish that they came with instructions on which brush is for what-I&#x27;m not exactly a professional</li>
            <li> also here to tell you all that these brushes were not soft at all.</li>
            <li> The gasses they were giving off on arrival was absolutely unreasonable, but it&#x27;s slowly improving.</li>
            <li> The strong bristles hold firm and the softer ones are very delicate on the skin.</li>
            <li> They are way better than my previous brushes which were expensive.  </li>
            <li> and I have only noticed just a little shedding after a washing them for the third time.</li>
            <li> I will be buying other set of brushes from a different brand.</li>
            <li> Not soft at all!</li>
            <li> The only con, is that it doesn&#x27;t have one of those blunt smudge brushes, and the blending brush is very very very rough compared to my ecotools one.</li>
            <li> so I can tell I will not be using this very long..</li>
            <li> only complaint is I would like to have the brushes labeled ( usage ) however a label maker and a roll of clear plastic label tape took care of that....</li>
            <li> Clean up well, and not too expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not big on makeup, but had a few events lined up last month, so decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I know only a few obvious ones:</li>
            <li> I use two of my brushes everyday and they have not disappointed me over the past few months.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now if you are looking for legit thick high grade brushes...these aren&#x27;t it and you won&#x27;t find any at this price</li>
            <li> I use these every single day.</li>
            <li> but it is a little disappointing since many reviewers have claimed they don&#x27;t shed even after multiple uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not good at all, very dissapponted</li>
            <li> However, I spent some time washing the case carefully and each brush, and after a few days the smell was gone completely.</li>
            <li> And since the brushes loose hair, the hair is all over my face after using them.</li>
            <li> only wish is that the kit contained a referral to the karity cosmetics website that promised to show you what each brush was for and how  to use it, but when I went to their website it seemed that the area must be down.</li>
            <li> I did this over night (just put the solution in a glass jar and put the brushes handle side down in the jar) and the smell was gone the next day.</li>
            <li> Despite washing them after purchase, I found them to be very coarse and almost sharp against my face... felt like little needles each time I put on product using any of the larger brushes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this will persist and I am not sure if it&#x27;s universal to the entire set (I haven&#x27;t tried the eye shadow or blending brushes yet), but that was somewhat disappointing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got the black and white set.  </li>
            <li> They have not shed any bristles, but the handles have come a little loose from regular use.</li>
            <li> My only suggestion would be for the brushes to be a little shorter.  </li>
            <li> The brushes themselves look a little tacky because of the white bands.</li>
            <li> After using the foundation brush three times I noticed that I was left with little hair bristles on my face.</li>
            <li> Personally, I cannot critique these brushes as I&#x27;m not familiar with anything makeup.</li>
            <li> I woud not recommend these to anybody as I am repeatedly picking the loose hair from the brushes off my face!</li>
            <li> I was excited to purchase them after all the positive reviews, I should have read the negative ones, which I have all the same problems as: terrible chemical smell, the brush bristles are too hard and don&#x27;t blend worth a damn.</li>
            <li> The brushes looked great; however, the smell of the brushes and pouch was absolutely disgusting - it even gave me a headache.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long they&#x27;ll last.</li>
            <li> The only reason i gave 4 &amp; not 5 stars is because it takes several days to air this set of brushes out to eliminate or at least minizine the odor of paint.</li>
            <li> Minimal shedding.</li>
            <li> Just what I had wanted and expected.</li>
            <li> They are not very dense but they get the job done.</li>
            <li> However, it is everything I expected to be</li>
            <li> I was just looking for everyday personal use.</li>
            <li> The ones I have used have not really shed during use.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s not much of an added benefit.</li>
            <li> and I have had minimal shedding.</li>
            <li> I then washed the brushes to get rid of the smell (be careful to wash them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Some of the hairs may shed but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> Utter waste.    </li>
            <li> I personally did not like these brushes because they shed every time I use them and thought these where a waste of 14 dollars.</li>
            <li> I received the brushes sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about what I expected from the price though.</li>
            <li> The metal piece that holds the bristles is very loose and wobbly where it is attached to the handle of the brush.</li>
            <li> I got it for my Secret Santa, and hopefully she likes it as much as I did.</li>
            <li> I have purchased expensive sets and brushes thinking $$$ mean better throughout the years, never again.  </li>
            <li> Despite the few annoyances, I have to say they are decent starter brushes, and it&#x27;s hard to beat the price.</li>
            <li> there are only 12 brushes, because seriously who needs 50 brushes in a set, you really only needs a couple of brushes to do makeup</li>
            <li> I retired my other brushes and put these front &amp; center on my vanity.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to say how long they&#x27;ll last.</li>
            <li> My only minor complaint would be</li>
            <li> The brush bag feels cheap and has an unpleasant feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recomment other Amazon shoppers to get this.</li>
            <li> They smelled weird when I first got them</li>
            <li> The case is not pretty</li>
            <li> I kept the other set.</li>
            <li> I wish I had purchased these sooner instead of my other brushes.</li>
            <li> They are firmly attached, it has long handle,they don&#x27;t shed and the brush don&#x27;t have a smell (except for the leather case).</li>
            <li> nothing.. pretty useless for me when i dont know what to use each one for.</li>
            <li> Small enough to travel with if I need it, I would recommend it if you like firmer bristles in your brushes.</li>
            <li> if not better I would definitely recommend purchasing</li>
            <li> Other than that, I got rid of them and went ahead and got some Zoeva brushes.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nothing extreme.</li>
            <li> And i&#x27;ve read the other reviews saying that ut smells like chemicals</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit disappointed and considering sending them back...not sure yet.</li>
            <li> I do like the concealer brush, and a couple of the other medium brushes.</li>
            <li> I washed the brushes before using, just as other reviewers suggested.</li>
            <li> The small brushes worked well, but there was lots of shedding on my face with the larger brushes</li>
            <li> That caused a small amount of makeup to get mixed.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> The product came in before expected!</li>
            <li> Smelled a lot like paint when I first got them, which I thought was weird.</li>
            <li> I use them every other day to put make up on before my show.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I would not recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> but thought I&#x27;d give it a try based on some of the other reviews.</li>
            <li> They are very rough too.</li>
            <li> Brushes had a bad smell, hair falls out of brushes easily while applying make-up, case is plastic material.  </li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve ever have a brush that didn&#x27;t loose a few...</li>
            <li> Alot of people stated they smelled bad after opening them, but mine were fine.</li>
            <li> and there if I pull/clean too hard, but I&#x27;ve had a few encounters with REALLY bad ones before, and these are so much better!</li>
            <li> Its crazy how different your makeup can look when you have a decent brush set.</li>
            <li> Slightly overrated by other buyers, but I do like them anyway.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the bristles have come onto my face with one of the brushes.</li>
            <li> Only negative is I&#x27;ve found the bristles come out sometimes.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I had was the smell.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be the smell of the bag the brushes lay in smells like paint</li>
            <li> I use the brushes everyday and there is minimal shedding.</li>
            <li> My only slight complaint was to do with the bag&#x27;s smell.</li>
            <li> They started shedding from the beginning, thought it might die down, but nahhh still keep shedding everywhere, on the face, while washing, even while just laying in the container.</li>
            <li> Other than that little inconvenience I would buy this again if I needed too.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s little pouch because other brands don&#x27;t come with it</li>
            <li> A other that I like them !</li>
            <li> The only minor con is the length of the brushes past 7 in, which is not good when using bathroom mirror up close for detail work.</li>
            <li> the narrower brushes, there are a couple of slant-tipped brow/eye brushes for filling in eyebrows or providing edge detail on eye make up, a couple of round-topped eye blender brush/eyeshadow brush/smudging brushes and a single - headed very narrow lip liner brush as well as a slightly wider lip</li>
            <li> but I paid a lot less on amazon.</li>
            <li> Threw away all previously owned brushes.</li>
            <li> I have no idea how to use half of them.</li>
            <li> well the brushes are fine but the handles are not labeled :(</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m slightly jealous and looking forward to buying one for myself.</li>
            <li> The bigger brushes are stiff and hard.</li>
            <li> HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!</li>
            <li> I did notice a very few partial stray hairs here and</li>
            <li> so there is less waste.</li>
            <li> There is a slight plastic smell, but it dissipates within a few minutes.</li>
            <li> The eye brushes are a little scratchy but not unbearable.</li>
            <li> The brushes feel a little raspy, but they are, after all, synthetic.</li>
            <li> and though I do wear a little makeup, I don&#x27;t need brushes and fancy stuff.</li>
            <li> It says on a little card: Log onto Karitycosmetics.com to find the function of each brush.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these, one for me and one for my little sister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They do have a chemical smell, but I got rid of it by soaking the handles of the brushes in a solution of water, dr. bronners castille soap, and a little bit of vinegar.  </li>
            <li> they  do shed, but all brushes do (not a lot of shedding just a little).</li>
            <li> Brush fiber are a little on the stiffer side though.</li>
            <li> They work, and it is a neat little kit of brushes.</li>
            <li> I ordered me a set in pink!!!</li>
            <li> The instructions directed me to the web site, which was a little inconvenient given that I was ready to use the brushes.  </li>
            <li> The only bad thing is that the hair falls out frequently.</li>
            <li> The brushes were nice, but there was an awful chemical smell when I received the brushes.</li>
            <li> I just bought this brush set a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> One of my qualms with these brushes is how harsh they feel against my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing the \\&quot;combination\\&quot; is heavy on the synthetic side of things.</li>
            <li> Waste of money....</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had trouble with bristles falling out yet, and I&#x27;ve had them about a</li>
            <li> I have had them for some time and use them everyday.</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves don&#x27;t smell, and the smell of the pouch fades a few days after opening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, would buy again.</li>
            <li> I have bought a few as gifts.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this refuse.</li>
            <li> Not a lot, just a few every now and then</li>
            <li> My one dislike is that the bristles in the bigger brushes (blush, powder, etc) are a bit thin.  </li>
            <li> still use them everyday.</li>
            <li> Quite honestly, these brushes aren&#x27;t awful.</li>
            <li> Just what you need for your everyday and not-so-everyday nights out.  </li>
            <li> This is a waste to me.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this set a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I have been using these brushes for about three weeks now and have already found a few issues: 1.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this at all.</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s quite a lot with heavy use.</li>
            <li> Have just used them a few times.  </li>
            <li> , you know just to name a few.</li>
            <li> My daughter enjoys them and uses them everyday.</li>
            <li> I bought these make-up brushes a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> But after a few days the smell goes away.</li>
            <li> I use them everyday.</li>
            <li> Have not had any trouble with brush pieces</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what you get sometimes, when you waste your money on a bargain.</li>
            <li> I have been using these brushes for a few days</li>
            <li> At the end of the day, it is something that&#x27;s guna touch your face everyday</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t shed much, but it&#x27;s enough that it becomes a bit annoying.</li>
            <li> If I had any complaint at all, I would want the powder brush to be a little softer, but other than that, they meet all my expectations and goals.</li>
            <li> Took days to &amp;#34;air them out&amp;#34; so they stunk less!</li>
            <li> but the brushes are a little too rough &amp; start to come off as you use it which is not good.</li>
            <li> dramatic make ups especially.</li>
            <li> I got my brushes a few weeks ago and use them EVERYDAY!</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad bunch, but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend these to a friend and I am currently looking elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only bad thing about this set was the initial smell of the package.</li>
            <li> (though the case did smell a little plastic-y) and I use them often!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed very little shedding since.</li>
            <li> Firm but not too hard.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the smaller brushes are great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure what it is, so I took off the plastic and it turned out it was coming from the bag or brush holder.</li>
            <li> Use everyday!</li>
            <li> I have used all but two of the small brushes and the largest brush.</li>
            <li> I wash them regularly and they don&#x27;t get weird.</li>
            <li> not sure if its the bag or the brushes, but either way...</li>
            <li> However, the only thing I could say is it has that weird leather smell.</li>
            <li> I had to get past the factory gasoliney smell of the fake leather bag, but that wasn&#x27;t too big of a deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure how to explain it.</li>
            <li> The powder brushes are too small.</li>
            <li> Did have a small plastic smell but after airing out a day</li>
            <li> Initial cleaning produced black residue...concerned that I could put something dangerous on my face.</li>
            <li> It seems that four of the twelve brushes can be used for eye makeup, and it is again, a little disappointing that they are all about the same size.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t begun to use the brushes yet, but it was frustrating to not receive any instructions in the case like other reviews</li>
            <li> The eyelash comb was already broken, not worth your money.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about ordering brushes online being that you can&#x27;t see what your paying for and the fact the most recent reviews were horrible about this product .</li>
            <li> Set hairs are hard and can not remove the chemical smell.</li>
            <li> The brush has separated from the handle making it hard to apply my make-up.</li>
            <li> When I use them to apply foundation, the hair is too hard and scratches my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to beat a 12-piece brush set for this price.</li>
            <li> The brush handles are really thin, I prefer mine to be a little thicker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting into makeup lately, and figured this brush set would be perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think that the amount of brushes is a negative thing.</li>
            <li> The only thing i am unhappy with is how they look.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t retain product well enough to even apply make up, and they shed like crazy.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t heard anything negative about it.</li>
            <li> Despite some of the negative reviews, I went ahead and purchased these brushes.</li>
            <li> This makes holding the brushes awkward because I have to adjust my grip in order to keep the head from moving back and forth with each stroke.</li>
            <li> For some reason they don&#x27;t run very small</li>
            <li> I am used to higher end brushes and get very frustrated with the foundation brush.</li>
            <li> At $30 each that is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I am a casual make up user, and typically don&#x27;t use brushes.</li>
            <li> ten were bad</li>
            <li> therefore no good to use end of story.</li>
            <li> so it makes me really sad that I&#x27;m having a lot of trouble with the hair falling out of the brushes and getting stuck to my face..</li>
            <li> NOT GOOD.</li>
            <li> The fibers were not good.</li>
            <li> It smells like a harsh chemical - don&#x27;t want to put something that smells this terrible anywhere near my face.</li>
            <li> Too bad I&#x27;m not a professional make-up artist because there are some brushes that I have no idea what to use for..lol.</li>
            <li> The first thing is that the bag that it comes in DOES smell awful!</li>
            <li> Even for the low pricepoint, I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;4 stars were given on the fact that a couple hairs from the brushes come out during makeup application with almost every use and one of the brushes&#x27; wood glue was weak</li>
            <li> When I first opened they smelled HORRIBLE...</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased ELF brushes but the were shedding like crazy.</li>
            <li> But it is very very faint and not very noticeable at all!</li>
            <li> It did get worse when I unrolled the brushes...  </li>
            <li> I just got ANOTHER request from the seller to review the product even though I HAVE reviewed the product and mentioned I was annoyed by their begging for reviews.</li>
            <li> not great brushes.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes for a friend for Christmas because I was tired of using her sponge aplicators every time she asked me to do her her makeup.  </li>
            <li> I am not great at makeup by any means, but i know that some brushes just don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Not great quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not totally happy with the quality and size..</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give them five stars because the powder brush is stiff and shed likes crazy.</li>
            <li> Not a good product!</li>
            <li> Sorry I wasted my money on my expensive one!</li>
            <li> I bought two sets for my mother and I, and was a little hesitant about the reviews saying they smelt bad.</li>
            <li> I read that a few people were frustrated with the smell of the case.  </li>
            <li> the thin eyeliner brush is useless.</li>
            <li> The stippling brush is nearly impossible to use without a couple of hairs coming out :/</li>
            <li> I washed them &amp; black crap came out.</li>
            <li> its a set that doesnt include anything ill never use.</li>
            <li> and they were expensive.</li>
            <li> It was a quite uncomfortable smell.</li>
            <li> Whoever designed them obviously has horrible taste, but that is besides the point.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this set.</li>
            <li> It was just sad.</li>
            <li> The chemical smell when you open these is horrible.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Other reviewers have said that this product has a weird smell.</li>
            <li> I got here these brushes in hopes to curb her appetite for expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> Really can&#x27;t go wrong with these brushes.  </li>
            <li> I am sorry I bought them.</li>
            <li> They feel and look expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad that my experience wasn&#x27;t like all the others.</li>
            <li> When I opened up the case it smelled awful but all of the brushes were there and after letting the smell air out for a few days it was almost gone.</li>
            <li> and she go crazy because of it..</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;the will get dirty.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m afraid the bristles are going to fall off.  </li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t tell any difference with an expensive brand!</li>
            <li> For the price its silly NOT to get them!</li>
            <li> It had a faint chemical smell but that didn&#x27;t bother me at all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in awe of the reviews for these brushes because I&#x27;ve had a relatively unpleasant experience with them.</li>
            <li> that said however, these brushes aren&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how bad the smell was.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> The product delivered on-time and the quality doesn&#x27;t look bad for the price</li>
            <li> The eye brushes are not that bad though.</li>
            <li> Bad news:  </li>
            <li> I am not picky about brushes but these ones are soooooo bad.</li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews, they smell so bad....</li>
            <li> The brushes seem find, but the plastic case they came in smelled so bad that I had to throw it away and put the brushes in something else.</li>
            <li> They smell really bad.</li>
            <li> the smell of the bag is bad, but it&#x27;s not a problem to remove it</li>
            <li> &amp; I get so frustrated.</li>
            <li> but once I received it the case and the brushes had a painful smell.</li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;m just disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in quality</li>
            <li> Disappointed</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the quality of the brushes.</li>
            <li> Once I received the bag I wasn&#x27;t disappointed at all.  </li>
            <li> I followed all directions and extremely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> and I hate wiggly brush heads).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The barrage of begging by the company is annoying as hell.</li>
            <li> My daughter was very disappointed with that.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Terrible quality.</li>
            <li> They do have some shedding, but it isn&#x27;t terrible.</li>
            <li> These are HORRIBLE brushes!!</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> That to me is outrageous.</li>
            <li> Terrible brushes.</li>
            <li> The case had an awful smell to it.</li>
            <li> nothing shocking</li>
            <li> Like realllllllly awful migraine inducing plastic chemical smell.</li>
            <li> These are HORRIBLE!</li>
            <li> They also have the worst chemical type of smell to them.</li>
            <li> it is very annoying</li>
            <li> the smell, once the outer packaging was removed, was horrific.  </li>
            <li> , awful</li>
            <li> but I must say these are the worst set of brushes I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> Just terrible!</li>
            <li> It is very annoying.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this product about 2 or 3 times, the brush hairs started shriveling up as if someone had burnt them with a lighter... Looked so disgusting</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent brushes.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Well made and so soft!</li>
            <li> Amazing brushes!! They works perfectly!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful set of brushes - I was expecting to have to pay way more for this quality.</li>
            <li> I have been using these brushes for over a month now.  Very high quality, I was not expecting such quality given the price point but I am happily surprised.  Good service as well, seller followed up twice.</li>
            <li> Great price. .super brushes. Perfect starter set for my new business.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased these brushed and I really like them. When I first used them they shed a bit but after several uses they stopped. A pretty good product and if I needed to, I&#x27;d buy these again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally wear makeup so I just needed some brushes that would get the job done. I&#x27;m not a makeup professional, so I don&#x27;t know what good brushes are supposed to do, but these do what I need them to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these brushes for over a month now. They haven&#x27;t shed and work beautifully.</li>
            <li> They are a good brushes!! For a ship price you&#x27;ll buy 12 good brush brushes</li>
            <li> When taking the brush set out of the box, which was very neatly packaged by the way, WOW, I was hit with an over powering chemical smell!  Like potent nail polish remover!!!  It did get worse when I unrolled the brushes...  After airing out and washing them they are great cosmetic brushes.  But probably would not order again, too toxic...</li>
            <li> Very nice case and brushes</li>
            <li> I had to return this brushes.  There was a strong chemical smell on them and it made me not want I use them on my skin.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, don&#x27;t shed much, good value for price. 4 stars because the case I received wasn&#x27;t sewn properly.</li>
            <li> Beautiful brushes. This is my first set of professional makeup brushes and I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, very soft. The only complaint I have is that the bag has a strong paint/chemical smell- which I&#x27;m sure will go away. But great quality brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the quality of the brushes as well as the quick delivery. Ordered on a Sunday and the brushes were in my mailbox on Wednesday!&lt;br /&gt;I doubt I will ever use all of the brushes but it&#x27;s great to have options!&lt;br /&gt;Good value for what you get.</li>
            <li> When i first opened the package, I immediately smelled a strong chemical odor, like when you paint or like a really concentrated sharpie, so I took the brushes out of the case and put the case in my closet for a couple of days and the smell was gone. The brushes work pretty well for a beginner the only thing I wish it had was an eyeshadow blending brush</li>
            <li> These brushes are great quality and have a great price. The case is good quality too.&lt;br /&gt;There is a brush for your every make up need.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was really fast. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really really love this brush set. I don&#x27;t wear makeup that often, and when I did before I got this brush set, I was happy with what I could do; but now with this new set, I have been able to do a lot more with my eye makeup. I actually feel like I know what I&#x27;m doing and my friends have all commented that my makeup looks great. So no complaints here.  The only thing I do wish was that the brushes were labeled with their function like another set I saw and almost bought. But other than that, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> great for the price.  Lots of variety and I love the handy case. The smell is still on it and its been over 2 weeks. But Im overall happy!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! They are very soft on your skin and apply my makeup evenly. So much more than I expected for the cost.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, good quality</li>
            <li> My daughter like this set of brushes a lot.</li>
            <li> These brushes are actually really nice. They don&#x27;t have the plastic-feel that most of the makeup brushes on Amazon have. I bought one set for my sister, and after checking them out I bought a second set for myself. Just make sure you wash them and you&#x27;re good!</li>
            <li> These brushes are a fantastic quality for the price!  I have one very expensive makeup brush and these are just as good!  Sorry I wasted my money on my expensive one!</li>
            <li> Great quality, great price. I&#x27;m a makeup artist and these work great.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, used them for my halloween makeup, nice quality</li>
            <li> High quality and arrived on time. VERY happy customer(:</li>
            <li> loved it highly recommend it and the price is amazing regular price thesis are 80 bucks this is a good deal</li>
            <li> These are great brushes! Perfect for any job.</li>
            <li> Excellent brushes! The long handle gives the feeling of easier grip and use. I rarely experienced having to deal with loose bristles on my face.</li>
            <li> Great quality for the price I paid. It looks great it could even go as a nice gift.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome pair or brushes</li>
            <li> I like these a lot, yes they are $10-12. Realize you are getting what you pay for. They smelled a little plastic-y from the brush holder, but other then that these are actually great! I use them on a daily basis! A hair comes out here and there but overall very satisfied. Shipping was fast too. I bought one in black, and purple for my best friend.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied for the price.</li>
            <li> Pretty good brushes with good shipping</li>
            <li> Slightly overrated by other buyers, but I do like them anyway.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money good product came faster than expected</li>
            <li> Brushes are soft and work great! Timely delivery and a great value.</li>
            <li> excellent quality for a great price</li>
            <li> Good set of brushes! Love them all!</li>
            <li> These brushes are wonderful. So soft and gives you the look of a professional make up artist.</li>
            <li> Good for the price, but now the little bristles are coming off onto my face everytime I put my makeup on ): They were good for about a month and now I&#x27;m just disappointed. Had to throw them in the garbage</li>
            <li> I bought for my wife for Christmas and she seems to really like them. They got here really quick too. I would totally buy again.</li>
            <li> Awesome price. Fast delivery. Brushes are good quality, and I love the case that they come in. Easy for organizing and quick travels.</li>
            <li> These brushes are nice! I wish they were labeled so you know when to use each one. The brushes do shed a bit but overall I was very impressed with the quality especially for the price!!!</li>
            <li> &#x60;I know absolutely nothing about makeup and the act of applying it but I bought these for my best friend and she called me just to tell me how much she loved them. I&#x27;ve been told they&#x27;re fantastic brushes. They&#x27;re definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Good product with little to no shedding. Great buy! I looked on the website and its worth 85$...</li>
            <li> Very nice for the money</li>
            <li> When I opened up the case it smelled awful but all of the brushes were there and after letting the smell air out for a few days it was almost gone. Recommend to wash the brushes first !!</li>
            <li> i bought these for my daughter, who really liked them.  Very high quality.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and item as described. Very strong smell as other reviewers noted but it rapidly faded. Haven&#x27;t had much need to actually use the set but they seem like a great buy. I will add to my review when I&#x27;ve had the chance to use them and given them their first cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Finally got the chance to really use these brushes and I think they are awesome. I am using the mineral makeup and the product went on flawlessly using one of the bigger brushes. My favorite part of these brushes are the smaller eyeshadow brushes, I found that some of my eyeshadows that don&#x27;t seem to go on with a lot of pigment seem renewed using these brushes. The color seems a lot more true and I don&#x27;t have to apply more and more to get the effect I want. I did notice a very few partial stray hairs here and there but nothing I would complain about. Definitely 5 stars all the way, if you are relatively new to makeup brushes like me than I would definitely recommend this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only wish is that the kit contained a referral to the karity cosmetics website that promised to show you what each brush was for and how  to use it, but when I went to their website it seemed that the area must be down. I would have loved the tutorial. Also, this exact set retails for $85 or something on their website, I am not sure if this is realistic price but I paid a lot less on amazon.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews but I absolutely love my brushes. very soft and easy to work with. i love the case. its a set that doesnt include anything ill never use. in love!!</li>
            <li> my daughter likes them</li>
            <li> Love it! I love the case it comes in and the brushes feel and look really nice!</li>
            <li> I love my new make up brushes!</li>
            <li> Is really good brushes my wife love it.</li>
            <li> I bought the brush set for my daughter.  She recently started professional make up school and I thought she would use them for school. However, she likes the set so much, she is keeping them for herself!</li>
            <li> I had very high hopes for these brushes, despite the very low price. I&#x27;m not sure how they have such positive reviews. I waited to review until I personally tried them out myself. They left hairs all over my face when I applied my makeup. When the blush brush started to do this I rubbed it along the back of my hand a bit to get all the loose pieces out and huge chunks just fell out of it. Terrible quality.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing! Its crazy how different your makeup can look when you have a decent brush set. Plus the price is great! Would definitely recommend❤</li>
            <li> Great quality. Exactly what I was wanting.</li>
            <li> Great price for brushes.  Minimal shedding.</li>
            <li> These were very high quality for the price.  Would recommend purchasing if you are looking for a nice set of high quality brushes that are easy to take along with you and cover all of your cosmetic application needs.</li>
            <li> I only used it once, but overall it was really soft and does it&#x27;s job. When i first recieved it, it had strong scent but I think it was the bag&lt;br /&gt;it comes in NOT the brushes. I&#x27;d recomment other Amazon shoppers to get this. For the price for these brushes, why not. ??</li>
            <li> Got this product as a gift for my mom for Christmas. She has since thrown out all her other brushes and is loving this set. Would buy again!</li>
            <li> This was a nice set. I bought these as a gift for my younger cousin who just started wearing makeup. i should have bought one for myself</li>
            <li> These are fantastic brushes. I waited to write my review until I had used these brushes for awhile to give a accurate review of the product. The bristles are natural and the makeup goes on nice a smooth, the bristles have not fallen out even with extensive use. They are soft and the makeup stays on the brushes very well. The case is nice and not to big and good for traveling. I like that there are only 12 brushes, because seriously who needs 50 brushes in a set, you really only needs a couple of brushes to do makeup and you clean them after you use them anyway. The price is really good for the product you receive, and the seller was fantastic got to me faster than what they had originally told me online! I am very happy with the product, and service.</li>
            <li> Very nice complete make-up pieces. Great gift for college students.</li>
            <li> Great brush set, love!</li>
            <li> Looks professional and the materials are nice.</li>
            <li> They look great and the ones I have used their performance is good. We will have to see about their durability as time progresses.</li>
            <li> It is made of natural hair. The bristle does not fall and feels very soft on the skin. The brushes set my make up well.</li>
            <li> I love them!!!!! It blends so well! I would recommend!</li>
            <li> Great brushes. This set has everything I needed</li>
            <li> Great quality, no shedding, shipping was on time. Im happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Brushes work well. Arrived on the date given. A good product for the price.</li>
            <li> I loved my brushes and they came right on time, i thank you and greatly appreciate everything..</li>
            <li> Nice brushes for the price</li>
            <li> These brushes are awesome. I got my delivery today and I gave them a try....works like a charm. I have had some pretty bad brushes in my lifetime, these are amazing.</li>
            <li> Great!! I love this pack&lt;br /&gt;the make up brush works great, leaving skin smoothly covered</li>
            <li> Overall they do the job for the price. However, one of the brushes came apart the first time using it and the others loose &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; a little more the I would like. other wise a decent value.</li>
            <li> Great brushes at an amazing price!  Would recommend or purchase again!!!</li>
            <li> These brushes do a great job for the price. They do have some shedding, but it isn&#x27;t terrible. Alot of people stated they smelled bad after opening them, but mine were fine. Just wash your brushes like always before using them and it will be just fine.</li>
            <li> Set hairs are hard and can not remove the chemical smell. Initial cleaning produced black residue...concerned that I could put something dangerous on my face. Save your money.</li>
            <li> Really Great Brushes for the Price!</li>
            <li> i bought this for a gift for a friend who is becoming a make up artist. It arrived on time, and although I haven&#x27;t used them, they appear to be good quality.</li>
            <li> Great brushes for a great price</li>
            <li> I wish I could give a zero star. DO NOT BUY THIS.</li>
            <li> Good brushes for the price! They smelled weird when I first got them but it went away after a while</li>
            <li> wonderful product at good value.</li>
            <li> These brushes are awesome.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my wife...she likes them, and uses them every day.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes. Soft. Works very well. Once in awhile a stray brush &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; is left on my face after using. Over all a wonderful deal. I would buy again!</li>
            <li> Bought these for my Daughter! She loves them!!</li>
            <li> Bought these brushes as a birthday present for a 12 year old girl that loves makeup. She loved the brushes and has been using them everyday since she got them. Fast shipping, good packaging, were exactly as described.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re decent for the price.</li>
            <li> For the money the brushes are great!......The pouch that they came in had to go immediately thoughbecause of a very strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li> My daughter ordered this set and loves it. She says it was worth 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Love the brushes .. first time user of make up after taking make up classes.&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are great for the money paid</li>
            <li> Great product for great price!</li>
            <li> VEry nice set. good quality and many different brush types</li>
            <li> Great set of brushes for the money!</li>
            <li> The brushes are well made with even build nice soft tapered tips.</li>
            <li> These are quality brushes. The handles are well made and a good fit in my hand. Handles are long enough to use easily unlike some of. Heaped quality. The bristles do not shed. I have been using the set about 6 months and they are still good as new. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love the brushes! Use them daily!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are truly professional!!! They apply eye shadow &amp; my powder foundation without lines&lt;br /&gt;The natural brush is the way to go because they hold more product &amp; the blending brush adds the professional touch!! I would highly recommend these brushes to anyone &amp; the price is right</li>
            <li> These brushes in general are very good, but for the price they are excellent! Definitely satisfied with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Overall the brushes were of decent quality. I really liked the ones for eye makeup and the bag that they were in was a nice size. For the money, it is well worth it. My rating would have been higher but I did not like the many, many e-mails that I received from the seller after the purchase with the subject, &amp;#34;Amazon order needs your attention.&amp;#34;  Every time I clicked to find a message saying, &amp;#34;Please! - We Really need some good reviews on these brushes!&amp;#34; Very tacky.</li>
            <li> My daughter is a professional performer and she loves these brushes. Wonderful for both theatrical and everyday use.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great for such a low price! I&#x27;ve had them for about four months and I have only noticed just a little shedding after a washing them for the third time. As long as you keep them clean they apply makeup beautifully !</li>
            <li> I bought them for my daughter and she really enjoys them.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, very soft and precise. Love the case, feels nice, protects the brushes perfectly, preventing them from fraying, mixing, and getting disheveled. Wish there was a medium/large brush, but other than that it&#x27;s fantastic</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice, I&#x27;ve used a few of them and they all work great.  No bristles have fallen while I&#x27;ve used them.  The case is not pretty but it&#x27;s a convenient way to keep all the brushes together.  Getting 12 brushes and the case for that price is an awesome deal.  I bought one for me and one for my sister.</li>
            <li> Great brushes!! Can&#x27;t beat the price either!</li>
            <li> So, the first time I washed these brushes after getting them, they bled a reddish color. Don&#x27;t know why makeup brushes would be dyed, especially red. After using them a couple of times, I will say they&#x27;re OK brushes for what you pay. The eye brushes are a little scratchy but not unbearable. I don&#x27;t really use the lash/brow comb, I prefer a spoolie for my brows &amp; my Tweezerman lash comb for lashes, so I can&#x27;t comment on that. Overall not a bad starter set of brushes. I do like how they come in a roll to keep everything together.</li>
            <li> i am glad i bought these brushes... they work so well and bought them for a good price... the only thing i could say is that it had a funky smell to them but they work awesome</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!!! The quality and price is great!! I&#x27;m delighted</li>
            <li> This is the best brush set that I have purchased thus far. Very high quality. I had these brushes over three months and they have yet  shed. Absolutely awesome trust you won&#x27;t be disappointed if you purchase them.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Bought 4 sets. One for me and each of my 3 daughters.  They are wonderful!!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my teenage granddaughter she loved the brushes.</li>
            <li> Great brushes for a good price</li>
            <li> These are very good brushes for the price--work perfectly - highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would ask is that each brush be labeled with its function.  The instructions directed me to the web site, which was a little inconvenient given that I was ready to use the brushes.  Still, this is a great buy of a high quality product.</li>
            <li> So glad I found these I&#x27;ve looked every where and they were expensive. Will buy again brushes work great with all my make up an foundations.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. There is every brush you&#x27;ll need to make your face look absolutely awesome. I have had these brushes for six months now with no problems.</li>
            <li> excelent product excelen seller 100%</li>

            <li> My girlfriend loves it. She was so surprised and the product&#x27;s work well.</li>
            <li> This brush set was purchased as a gift for my teen aged granddaughter who participates in competitive dance and is a pom pom girl at her high school. She wears a LOT of make up for performances. She said these brushes are just what she needed. Her make up goes on easily using them and she is able to contour and shade just the way she likes. The case makes taking them to her shows convenient.</li>
            <li> Perfect set of brushes! I love them. They are very soft! :D</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! Was wanting something high quality with a good price and this is it! Also the case they come is is super cute!</li>

            <li> Love the set! Gave me several great brushes I did not have before and for a great price! The case is great as well to keep everything safe and new! Kind of weird, chemically smell to them at first but it seems to be going away. Overall happy with this set! Very excited about the fan brush in particular!</li>
            <li> Works great, there is a brush for everything, great price.</li>
            <li> They were bought as part of a Christmas gift for my son&#x27;s girlfriend.  They looked quite impressive, and she seemed happy to get them.</li>
            <li> These brushes are awesome! My order came on time and the brushes have been great! I would definitely recommend these!</li>
            <li> I received the two brush sets in two days as promised. I gave one set as gift snd I kept the other set. We love them@</li>
            <li> great brushes, the set is very convenient and bristles are gentle on the face.  I would have given it a 5 star but there is no instruction sheet for the use of each brush.</li>
            <li> The product was received promptly and the quality was excellent!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 13 year old daughter, and she is thrilled with all the brushes.</li>
            <li> i bought a couple of these as presents and they were perfect. They look professional good quality, and the bag it comes with is perfect for travelling.</li>
            <li> The brushes were nice, but there was an awful chemical smell when I received the brushes. I ended up sending them back because it was too strong to give as a gift to my mother in law.</li>
            <li> Love love love these brushes!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are high quality brushes and i love the way they feel.  For the price I expected cheap quality and for the brishes to slowly fall apart...nope!!!!  These are the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
            <li> Really good product. It was bought as a gift and it made the receiver really happy to get it. I am satisfied with it. It was also delivered pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful and very very</li>
            <li> Excellent quality &amp; value. This was purchased as a gift for a friend. She has been thrilled with the brushes. They were the perfect gift.</li>
            <li> First time user of make up and brushes are sufficient</li>
            <li> great product for a good price</li>
            <li> Great  Buy  would  recommend  to a friend.</li>
            <li> You have to air it out the plastic smell is so strong</li>
            <li> These are a very nice set. Purchased 3 sets for my 3 daughters and they are thrilled!</li>
            <li> This set has every kind of brush I needed.</li>
            <li> This brush set definitely worth the price and it&#x27;s a lot of it. So you can feel free to do make ups and change color.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes as a gift for mother. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the brushes. Very well made brushes with a beautiful case.</li>
            <li> These truly are professional quality brushes - and a perfect solution for applying makeup correctly.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great for the price. These are well made and do not shed like some brushes do. I am glad I took the chance and bought them.</li>
            <li> Great brushes! U really don&#x27;t need more than these 12 brushes unless u r a professional makeup artist. Really good quality.</li>
            <li> Great price - nice product.</li>
            <li> Great quality and speedy delivery!</li>
            <li> Bought these as a replacement for my old brushes.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on good brushes but at the same time I wanted to them to be good quality. I have to say these brushes are pretty good quality for the price. I was pleasantly surprised at how soft the brushes were. They look and feel like real professional brushes. They come in a nice protective case. They are definitely worth the buying. They are way better than my previous brushes which were expensive.  The only thing is that the case does have a strong smell to it so you might have to leave it out for a few days to get aired out. Other than that great brushes. If looking for something good and affordable then look no further.</li>
            <li> looked impressive; gave them as a gift and the recipient seemed very happy with them.</li>
            <li> Gift for my 14 year old granddaughter. She is very happy with them. Nice starter set for her make up kit. Brushes look nice and quality is there.</li>
            <li> These brushes are super soft and apply makeup well</li>
            <li> Absolutely couldn&#x27;t believe that I got these brushes for such a great price!! Their quality was incredible, loved the carrying case and they were delivered in less than 36 hours!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for our daughter and she says these brushes are the best she has ever used!! Definitely recommend to the ladies out there!!</li>
            <li> has good casing and the brushes seem sturdy and they look exactly as shown great set !!!</li>
            <li> This is a beautifully presented set of really well made brushes that represents incredible value for money. They arrived with minimal packaging but the brush roll itself is lovely - a very attractive black and white pleather roll featuring the Karity logo with well-attached security ties.&lt;br /&gt;The twelve brushes contained within the roll are all very well finished and balanced with full-size handles that are comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;There are no instructions with the brushes but logging on to KarityCosmetics.com/welcome gives some brief indications of what the different types of brush are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the most useful brushes in the make up kit is a fan brush, the fan brush in this set has a good width making it a practical choice for dusting off excess powder and blending - if you prefer to use a fan brush to apply blusher then this one would be a decent pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many people will probably already own an extra large Kabuki powder brush in their battery of brushes, the long - handled one here is a good size, whilst not the same as a Kabuki it still gives generous coverage.There are a couple of stippling brushes as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the narrower brushes, there are a couple of slant-tipped brow/eye brushes for filling in eyebrows or providing edge detail on eye make up, a couple of round-topped eye blender brush/eyeshadow brush/smudging brushes and a single - headed very narrow lip liner brush as well as a slightly wider lip brush,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brow brush and comb is wider than most of this type. The larger brushes have sleeves provided to protect their bristles - not all of the smaller brushes do. That&#x27;s just a minor point. Overall, this is a brilliant buy and very good value.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received a code to apply a full cost discount to this item, but this is my honest opinion on the product.</li>
            <li> This was a great buy thank you</li>
            <li> Love these! Great quality abs every brush you need for basic and advance makeup application.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes. Nice bag. For the price  and my first set of brushes I&#x27;m very pleased. Thank you</li>
            <li> Not 100% natural hair as advertised on Amazon - some brushes are rough on my skin.  Brushes had a bad smell, hair falls out of brushes easily while applying make-up, case is plastic material.  Good selection of brushes to choose from, though.</li>
            <li> My wife asked for makeup brushes for a stocking stuffer at Christmas.  Having NO CLUE in the WORLD what to look for in a makeup brush, of course I asked my daughter and gave her several (what appeared to be high quality) sets available here on Amazon.  Out of those she picked this package and my wife was really happy with them...</li>
            <li> I got this for my sister in law and she just loves it!</li>
            <li> came on time, awesome product, will buy again</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Nice and smooth. Good quality, and size, with a variety of types.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing, especially for the price! I&#x27;ve used my set for close to two months now and have no complaints. The brushes are soft and durable and I swear my make-up looks better just from using them. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Brushes are very cheap.  The bristles break off on your face.  They are not soft at all.  I would not recommend buying them.</li>
            <li> The only con, is that it doesn&#x27;t have one of those blunt smudge brushes, and the blending brush is very very very rough compared to my ecotools one. Another thing is that they seem to only have medium, large and x-large shadow brushes. For some reason they don&#x27;t run very small so I just took one from my old set.</li>
            <li> Quality brushes.  Love them all!</li>
            <li> These brushes are nice. I don&#x27;t have much experience with makeup brushes so I can&#x27;t say how they compare to more expensive brands, but they work for me and the price was right! There are so many, I haven&#x27;t even used them all, but I&#x27;m glad I got them. They come in a nice bag you can use for storing or toting around, if necessary.</li>
            <li> Great price, great product, enjoying using them</li>
            <li> High quality brushes for a low price. Pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> Awesome set of brushes! The leather bag is a wonderful way to keep them all organized.  Shipping was fast and the packaging was perfect.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Wonderful quality brushes for a steal at the price!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re is a STRONG paint smell but I lOVE THIS SET</li>
            <li> I really enjoy how soft these brushes are! I have never had natural brushes before. The only thing is...I don&#x27;t know how to use so many different brushes or what all are suppose to be used for :)   Edited March 8th: I&#x27;ve had these brushes for a while now and I do still enjoy how soft they are. I have had a brush come apart already though! The brush has separated from the handle making it hard to apply my make-up.</li>
            <li> Love the brushes. The quality of them is excellent and the carry pouch is sturdy.  One suggestion would be to have an insert with a diagram of what the recommended use is for each brush. I figured it out on my own, but an small instruction book would have been appreciated. Thanks. I would purchase these again.</li>
            <li> These are very soft quality brushes. I love the variety that came in the package. I had brushes for my eyeshadow, to do my brows, to beat and contour my face and to just make myself look phenomenal. These brushes from a first impression remind me of the Morphe brushes. The only thing is the thing they came in smelled like paint. It was a quite uncomfortable smell.</li>
            <li> Great setup, great price!</li>
            <li> I bought this set as a gift for my sister and she loved it...no complaints!</li>
            <li> Good brushes.  Good price.</li>
            <li> I like these brushes. They don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> I like these brushes a lot as they blend my makeup very well, without it looking caked on. The only complaint I have is that the bristles have come onto my face with one of the brushes. Other than that they are great and within my price range.</li>
            <li> I love the brushes. I could not be more pleased especially with the texture and price. A Steal of a Deal!</li>
            <li> Good brushes. But some started shedding</li>
            <li> Perfect mini travel brush set.</li>
            <li> Mm it&#x27;s okay for the price, great for beginners! Would recommend.</li>
            <li> My daughter says that it&#x27;s pretty cool.</li>
            <li> Ordered two sets...neither had a foul smell...the brushes are soft and don&#x27;t shed</li>
            <li> Great set and price, I use this set everyday that I wear makeup.</li>
            <li> My 15 year old niece loves them!</li>
            <li> Really nice brushes, I&#x27;m very happy with them.</li>
            <li> Just what I had wanted and expected.</li>
            <li> Good set of brushes. Firm but not too hard. Only downside was the plastic/leather pouch them come in smells like gasoline. Otherwise great product and I would buy again.</li>
            <li> the face brushes aren&#x27;t my favorite, they&#x27;re constantly shedding and they aren&#x27;t very soft. I love the eye brushes though I use them daily</li>
            <li> Great brush set. Exceptional, high quality.</li>
            <li> Great quality and extremely happy with this purchase. I&#x27;ve been using the brushes daily for a couple months and have seen no negative signs of wear.</li>
            <li> Great price for how many different brushes come in the set, however, you get what you pay for...the chemical smell permeating from the bag is enough to knock you over; well it did to me. I can&#x27;t use something that toxic on my skin.</li>
            <li> So far these brushes work great.  I haven&#x27;t used all of them but the ones I&#x27;ve used for my eyeshadow are very good.  The bristles don&#x27;t fall out and the brush glides the eyeshadow on nice and evenly.  They&#x27;re pretty long from top to bottom, if that matters.  I&#x27;m used to a shorter makeup brush but that&#x27;s just my preference.  I would buy these again because they seem to be made very well and don&#x27;t look cheap or wear cheap at all.</li>
            <li> These brushes are excellent. Super soft and really nice.</li>
            <li> The best deal ever.  Brushes are wonderful.  I think they will last more than a year.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! They&#x27;re super soft on skin and are great for powder blending; have yet to try then on creams! I didn&#x27;t actually expect them to be as great due to the price I paid for them, but boy, was I wrong.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  The bag smells horrible--very rubbery.  A lot of brushes for a great price though.</li>
            <li> These brushes are perfect and far exceeded my expectations.  They are high quality and much better than I expected.  I highly recommend these&lt;br /&gt;brushes.</li>
            <li> Very nice brushes .. they do not fall apart at all. I&#x27;m amazed for the cost and will be buying another set for sure</li>
            <li> High quality brushes at a great price!</li>
            <li> it is really great for beginners and helps blend the make up very well.. would recommend to a friend!</li>
            <li> They are the best brushes I have had so far!</li>
            <li> They are absolutely everything &amp; more ! They are very soft , however, they did have a smell similar to nail polish remover, but it wasn&#x27;t a smell that lasted after you have cleaned them .</li>
            <li> Absolutely reek of chemicals right out package....like the smell of polyurethane, but it goes away if you give them a wash. They are  OK for the price. I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with the head becoming displaced from the stem like other users, but the brush hairs have begun to fall out left and right. One or two of these brushes I&#x27;ve begun to use regularly, but I would not purchase the full set again.</li>
            <li> These brushes were great! I bought them as a gift but was able to feel how soft they were. They weren&#x27;t MAC type soft but they are better than you would get than from buying brushes from walmart at the same price. Overall, I think these were an excellent way to start makeup techniques. Aside from that, the brushes were beautiful! The makeup case is very plastic-y but pretty good for storing the brushes on the go!</li>
            <li> I just bought this brush set a few weeks ago and I must say I love it. The brushes and the case are really good quality and I can&#x27;t wait to play around with them. This is my first set of brushes that I bought all together instead of buying one here and one there. I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> They work fabulously and the price cannot be beaten. I was lucky to come across it when I did. These are such high quality brushes.</li>
            <li> I love these.  They wash well with a mild soap(baby shampoo) and are great for precise application.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes.  Very nice leather pouch and they are very nice quality, soft brushes for a reasonable price.  These work as a perfect substitute for someone who can&#x27;t quite afford high end brushes and is a beginner brush user :)  I would have given five stars if these brushes were labeled.  Still would purchase them again.</li>
            <li> brushes could be softer yes. but for its price , theyre better than expected . great starter makeup brush set.</li>
            <li> The brusher are goof how ever it hairs of the brushes are left on my face after I use the blush and foundation brushes. Others are ok</li>
            <li> Brushes are professional quality and work beautifully!!!  They arrived fast.  I will definitely be ordering another set for my daughter.</li>
            <li> No complaints! They are great quality and work just like the professional brushes in salons.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes!!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are everything. You get great value at an inexpensive price.</li>
            <li> Great brushes. I would compare them to some other Sephora brushes I own. Plenty of variety for a much better price.</li>
            <li> I just used the brushes for the first time this morning, but I already love them!  They&#x27;re soft and don&#x27;t seem to shed.  I really like how the brushes apply my makeup and I love all the different size options!  My only suggestion would be for the brushes to be a little shorter.  The handles are a bit long and I like to be all up in the mirror so the handles will bump into it occasionally.  But overall, I absolutely love them for the value!</li>
            <li> Nice set but bigger brushes are hard &amp; shed a lot. The smaller in the set work pretty good. Cheaply made as well.</li>
            <li> Received product quickly. Brushes are soft &amp; easy to work with.</li>
            <li> Bought the set for the wife and she loves them, My step daughter is a styleist and she said they were high quality</li>
            <li> they are so soft, and good quality</li>
            <li> Bought these for my 15 year old daughter. She is very pleased with the brushes. Quality product!</li>
            <li> the brushes had to be cleaned very well and one came apart while cleaning...but i glued it back together. I was disappointed in quality But, they work just fine.</li>
            <li> Though I have had only brief opportunity to make use of the brush set, the Karity Professional set appears to be excellent quality, especially for the price.  I am glad to have found it.  I would recommend the set to anyone needing cosmetic brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting into makeup lately, and figured this brush set would be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, these brushes are good quality. If I bought all of these brushes at a regular store, they&#x27;d be at least double the price, so it&#x27;s a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy I got these brushes!</li>
            <li> Better than professional brands...love the way it applies the makeup flawlessly and the bristles are soft</li>
            <li> So many brushes for such a great price! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in awe of the reviews for these brushes because I&#x27;ve had a relatively unpleasant experience with them. One of my qualms with these brushes is how harsh they feel against my face. Despite washing them after purchase, I found them to be very coarse and almost sharp against my face... felt like little needles each time I put on product using any of the larger brushes. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the smaller brushes are great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest issue with these brushes: how easily individual strands come out of the larger brushes while I&#x27;m applying makeup. Not a morning goes by where I put foundation on my face without a fiber or five coming off on my face. I&#x27;m not applying product harshly (no one should), so I don&#x27;t understand why they come out with such ease...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second set of brushes I&#x27;ve used, the first being a Kirkland brand set (much softer; much more durable). Maybe I got a bad bunch, but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend these to a friend and I am currently looking elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this product three stars instead of two because the smaller brushes work as expected and the price of the set is good for what you get. If I could give the larger brushes an individual review, it&#x27;d definitely be 2 out of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> very good product, delivered on the agreed date, I am very happy with the purchase</li>
            <li> Excellent assortment of quality brushes. My daughter was thrilled with this set.</li>
            <li> They are nice quality, but a few bristles are falling out after only a month.</li>
            <li> Love these!! Work perfect</li>
            <li> Perfect and a great price!!</li>
            <li> I when I first received the brushed they came individually wrapped in the roll case. When I took one of the brushes out of the plastic the top came off and it broke. There was no shedding of hairs on the initial wash but the powder brush is starting to shed significantly while using it. I was not expecting much because of the price but they are ok.  They are not very dense but they get the job done. I would not repurchase them.</li>
            <li> I love these makeup brushes. I had been looking for an affordable yet quality set for quite awhile. Makeup is now a breeze to apply. In fact, for several years, I would merely use my clean fingertips to apply makeup. I would highly recommend this set!</li>
            <li> I bought these for someone else as a gift so I didn&#x27;t use them, however they looked like good quality brushes. The only con about them is they came in a leather pouch that smelled very strongly of chemicals and plastic.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter; she loves it!</li>
            <li> Very nice set. My girls are all using them to learn how to put on makeup. I even use them. Great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Good but not the best tho. Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> Love how fast this shipped and it is great quality my daughter is going to be so happy</li>
            <li> I Love these brushes....excellent quality</li>
            <li> Amazing quality for the price. Don&#x27;t pass this set up... I didn&#x27;t know what to expect and given the price thought I was getting some cheap set but it&#x27;s perfect. The case, the brushes.... Way more than what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I really love these brushes they have every brush from a tiny detail brush to big and fluffy one that blen! I recommend these if you enjoy dramatic make ups especially.</li>
            <li> Great set of brushes! My only concern is the bag they come in smells really strange.</li>
            <li> I have a friend who&#x27;s been looking for a make brush set she loves it... I live it to I bought one for my self good quality !!!!</li>
            <li> They came very nicely packed. I loved that all the bushes were wrapped so I KNOW they werent used. I am very happy with my purcahse. far better brushes than anything iv bought in the past and for the price you cant beat this deal</li>
            <li> Love this set and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. I&#x27;m used to spending over $50 for name brand brushes and these brushes are just as good, and definitely a better deal than those. They don&#x27;t feel cheap, stray hairs don&#x27;t mix in with your makeup like with cheaper brushes. Both the brushes and the case are of quality material. I use two of my brushes everyday and they have not disappointed me over the past few months.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product yesterday. Would I have writtten this review yesterday, I would have given it 4 stars just because I was pleased with the packaging and quality of the brush tips after one use. So far I have only used 2 brushes. Today, after the second use, one has already started shedding. Just a few hairs have shed off, so it didn&#x27;t bother me much but it is a little disappointing since many reviewers have claimed they don&#x27;t shed even after multiple uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I am not surprised. You know the saying. You get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;With that said however, these brushes aren&#x27;t bad at all. i am not big on makeup and am definitely no makeup artist, so these brushes work great for me. The brushes themselves look a little tacky because of the white bands. Whoever designed them obviously has horrible taste, but that is besides the point. I purchased them knowing that of course. The bag is also hideous, but again, not the point. I only wanted the brushes. Another comment I&#x27;d like to make is that these brushes seem to be better than Elf brand brushes, so that&#x27;s a plus for the price. So if you use Elf cosmetics, you will be pleased with the work of these brushes. These brushes aren&#x27;t super soft but soft enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the size differences between the brushes aren&#x27;t true to the display picture. Truthfully, I only purchased this set because I wanted more brushes for applying eyeshadow. It seems that four of the twelve brushes can be used for eye makeup, and it is again, a little disappointing that they are all about the same size. They differ by structure a tiny bit, but size wise, none of the eye brushes are small enough for small and smooth strokes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, if you are looking for decent brushes that will get the job done, these will do just fine.</li>
            <li> Great value. Very nice set of brushes!</li>
            <li> Washed them and put them to use. Only a few hairs falling from the contour brush after the first few months. Excellent product for the price.</li>
            <li> I like these brushes very much. I am still experimenting to see what works best. I am having good results though. I would recommend the brushes to my friends they are really soft and feel more expensive than they were.Great product.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter because she had issues with the bristles on the brushes ending up on her face when applying make up. She loves them! She doesn&#x27;t have that problem with the brush falling apart anymore. This is a good quality set...and a nice roll case. Would buy these again.&lt;br /&gt;C</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes for my mom and she loved them. The quality is great! They are soft and don&#x27;t leave residue hairs all over. Really fast shipping and really good price! A great product overall</li>
            <li> Bristles are soft, but the smell of plastic taste too.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this brush kit! The bristles are nice and soft, but are firm enough to blend contouring makeup and eyeshadows. The &amp;#34;leather&amp;#34; case is adorable and seems to be high quality. There was an odor when I first opened it, but that went away within the first few days. The bristles have stayed in really well so far. This is the first brush kit I have purchased, so I don&#x27;t have a lot to compare it to to be completely honest. However, it is everything I expected to be and I am really pleased with the purchase. It really seems like a great value.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my 18 yr old daughter, she loves them, says they are really nice quality, holds make up well.&lt;br /&gt;She has used them for 2 months now and says they are holding up great.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with these brushes!  They are great quality, especially considering the price.  Before I bought these, I was using the Sonia Kashuk brushes.  These are definitely comparable.  I read that a few people were frustrated with the smell of the case.  It does have a slight plastic smell when you first open it, but after it was out it open, it went away quickly. I am very happy with these brushes.</li>
            <li> Excellent, excellent brushes! The roll-up bag it comes with is a nice quality as well. I wish I had purchased these sooner instead of my other brushes. Love them!</li>
            <li> Awesome set, definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Great quality for great price! I&#x27;ve only used 2 for seldom times but loved them none the less. I love the pouch it comes in as well!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup very often but I love these brushes. I&#x27;ve used them a few times and they have been wonderful. They are sturdy and soft. I definitely recommend them</li>
            <li> First brush set ever. I don&#x27;t do a lot of makeup, but I think this will be a fantastic starter kit for me. I already used a couple of them for concealer one day to try them out. It didn&#x27;t blend quite like I see on the videos, but like I said, I don&#x27;t do make up often and don&#x27;t exactly know what I&#x27;m doing. The brush handles look like they&#x27;re made of some pretty decent quality and the heads don&#x27;t wiggle on the top (something I was nervous about since I do a lot of painting and I hate wiggly brush heads).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case does have a strong smell at first. Probably the only thing I don&#x27;t like, but it&#x27;s easy enough to get used to. I do appreciate having the case though.</li>
            <li> The product is fine. The brush bag feels cheap and has an unpleasant feel. The brushes themselves aren&#x27;t anything special but work okay. What wasn&#x27;t okay was the constant harrassment from the company until I left a review. They sent me three separate emails asking me to leave one, which I initially didn&#x27;t do because I really haven&#x27;t used these brushes all that much. Nevertheless, from my experience thus far - this set is a decent deal price-wise, but it isn&#x27;t anything amazing. The brushes feel a little raspy, but they are, after all, synthetic. Probably would have left four stars if not for the company&#x27;s harrassment.    Edit: Just notices that the company describes these as being of \\&quot;quality natural hair\\&quot; in the first product description and then writes farther down that \\&quot;The brushes are made from a combination of natural hair and synthetic hair for lasting performance, so they are soft and silky on top, yet firm and durable on the bottom.\\&quot; \\&quot;Soft and silky\\&quot; is definitely a stretch. I find these to be somewhat rough on my skin, especially in comparison to actual natural hair brushes. I&#x27;m guessing the \\&quot;combination\\&quot; is heavy on the synthetic side of things.</li>
            <li> I know nothing at all about these brushes, I&#x27;ve been a nature girl all my life and though I do wear a little makeup, I don&#x27;t need brushes and fancy stuff. I bought this cosmetic brush set as a gift for my teenage granddaughter, which I presented to her a couple of days ago. She seemed pretty happy with them, and with my limited knowledge I can say that they looked very nice, especially for the price. They come in a nice case, and there is a web address to go and read about each brush&#x27;s function, which I thought was a nice additional touch. Shipping and service from this seller were excellent.</li>
            <li> Great quality for the price.  Was given as a gift to my daughter and she absolutely loves them.</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for my daughter, she loves them!</li>
            <li> This was a gift and was delivered quickly. It&#x27;s exactly as depicted in the offering and I was very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re okay. has everything you need but the brushes are a little too rough &amp; start to come off as you use it which is not good. it didn&#x27;t feel like my foundation is going on evenly.</li>
            <li> These is a very nice product. This set is a lot bigger from what I imagined from the picture, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Lovely brush set...only complaint is I would like to have the brushes labeled ( usage ) however a label maker and a roll of clear plastic label tape took care of that....soon as my new stash of fave cosmetics arrive I will get back into doing my face after a few years hiatus. This is the first time I will be using a professional set of makeup brushes....really looking forward to pampering myself. Will update on brush performance, durability, etc after I have used them awhile.</li>
            <li> Ordered as a gift for a professional makeup artist. She agreed they were great quality and included all the necessary brushes for a traveling makeup gig. They included a nice reusable case that fits nicely into her kit and each brush was packed in a protective plastic.</li>
            <li> i know nothing about these things but i surprised my wife with them and she loved it it was defiantly worth it !!!!</li>
            <li> Really good value! Super nice for the cost :)</li>
            <li> No need to buy the $200.00 brushes when this one is so affordable and works exactly the same!!!!</li>
            <li> For the same price,in a department store, you only have five medium quality brushes,i hesitated,went home to Amazon,and of course i found a pouch of 12 fines,well organized soft,good quality brushes,to apply all kind of make up,some of them i don&#x27;t even know,how to use them but i will learn,all that for a super great price.I love my set,and some of you will too.I&#x27;m thinking of them as gifts for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Very nice product with unbeatable price. I had whole set of Bobbi brown and MAC brushs, but this set of brush just as awesome as those expensive brushes as they create the same result. If I found this brush set earlier I will skip my Bobbi brown and mac. definitely worth every penny. Will buy another set again.</li>
            <li> Fantastic brush set! Buy them! You can&#x27;t go wrong with this set.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised at the quality for such a great price! Softest brushes I have used. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I like these brushes very much. I like that they are in their own pouch. For me, there is one too many large brushes. I wish the was one more with tight, flat bristles annoy 3/4 of an in square. I would give a set it these as a gift. I will definitely use mine daily and take them when I travel. I recommend this purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife. She liked it.</li>
            <li> They are great! So nice but the only thing I didn&#x27;t get was a foundation brush and I use that the most. But it&#x27;s a really good set for the money.</li>
            <li> I love my new brushes, I use the angled brush for the dip brow pomade and it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> I got these brushed because the good reviews but they are not soft.... I will be buying other set of brushes from a different brand. Waste of money....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good brushes! I love them</li>
            <li> Truly great brush set!</li>
            <li> Great brushes, very soft and well made. I bought a second set for my sister.</li>
            <li> when i recieved the brush i immediately check attachment of the brush to its wooden handle, because as what i&#x27;ve read about the reviews most of the comment was the brush is not firmly attached to the handle. I was very thankful that the set i received is perfect. They are firmly attached, it has long handle,they don&#x27;t shed and the brush don&#x27;t have a smell (except for the leather case). I hope it will last a long time :)</li>
            <li> Brushes seem very nice.  They are a gift and I never used them personally, but they felt great.  I also like the case they came in.  Everything has its place!  Only dissapointment is that the brushes were not labeled for thier individual uses.  On the plus side they offer the info on thier website and you can write them on yourself!</li>
            <li> Great brushes, great price.  What a deal!</li>
            <li> good product with high quality!</li>
            <li> Great selection of brushes at an affordable price. The quality seems to be good, definitely better than the Sephora set i purchased a couple years ago. When I took them out of the package they had a very strong chemical smell, but that dissipated quickly.</li>
            <li> There are no instructions for these brushes in the package. It says on a little card: Log onto Karitycosmetics.com to find the function of each brush. I did that, and there are no instructions.. what does each brush do.. what is it used for.. nothing.. pretty useless for me when i dont know what to use each one for.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: I reviewed this some time back in early May, I know because it was before I would be traveling. I just got ANOTHER request from the seller to review the product even though I HAVE reviewed the product and mentioned I was annoyed by their begging for reviews. Do NOT buy this product. The brushes are fine if you only plan to use them at home, only, but they are too long to carry for daily maintenance or application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The barrage of begging by the company is annoying as hell. I use maybe three of the brushes weekly. I like the product overall, I like the pouch it came in, but I resent the company.Also the brushes a re so long I can&#x27;t take them with me. This is a thing with &#x27;professional brushes, and how you are supposed to hold them for application, so it&#x27;s not a slam on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may want to take this with a grain of salt, but here I go. I just recently started wearing makeup again on the regular after about 10 years of not. My daily routine doesn&#x27;t much involve brushes, but I decided to get a full brush kit. I like this set quite a bit. The folding case is fabulous, I&#x27;ve pretty much only used the eyebrow/eyelash brush, the eyeshadow brush and the angled contouring brush. I like the feel, and there wasn&#x27;t any shedding. There are probably several in here that I won&#x27;t use on the regular (I&#x27;m not a Kardashian after all). But I like to be well prepared, and since I&#x27;m just starting again to play with different looks I enjoy having the options.The length precludes me from carrying any of these around in my daily arsenal of tricks, BUT for fancy nights the length is a good thing since you are supposed to use long brushes, holding them from the furthest point to keep from over applying (length keeps you from being able to apply too much pressure when held correctly). I think this is a solid set of brushes at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I specifically did the after pic with the brushes.I apologize that the light and angle weren&#x27;t the same (that damn sun keeps moving!!!) I wasn&#x27;t going anywhere, just decided to try to use as many of the brushes as possible for the review.wasn&#x27;t going anywhere, just decided to try to use as many of the brushes as possible for the review.</li>
            <li> great pieces, good quality!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product despite the mixed reviews. Alas it&#x27;s not that great of a product. To me, makeup brush bristles should maintain shape especially after its first wash of cleaning. These brushes are already not maintaining its shape. They were inexpensive that explain the quality. When they first were taken out of the box it smelled like they spray painted the case. Very strong odor. I&#x27;ve started a return with Amazon but I don&#x27;t have a box to return it in and quite frankly returning anything you buy online is a hassle Amazon or not. Disappointed</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the brushes yet.  They look nice and the case looks good.  I am still airing them out after three days, because the chemical smell on them was too strong!!</li>
            <li> These are great make-up brushes.  Very soft.  I am very pleased with them.</li>
            <li> great, came on time and the product is wonderful</li>
            <li> Bought these for my fiancee and she loves them.... best part is she thinks i got them from Ulta and paid more than i did ;)</li>
            <li> They look nice, are soft and well finished. I haven&#x27;t use them yet. About the smell, they really have a strong chemical smell, but I took them out the case and plastic and it seems worked so far.</li>
            <li> These are good for a couple of times. Then you will see the hair falling off and once you wash them it won&#x27;t stop falling apart.:(</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price. A little rough at first but they fluff and get soft the more you use them.</li>
            <li> Great brushes and come in a awesome organizer.</li>
            <li> LOVED IT HAD TO ORDER ANOTHER ONE!</li>
            <li> Listed for $85 on company&#x27;s website. Amazon price under $25! well made and really nice to use. I just need to figure out what they all are used for!</li>
            <li> Brushes arrived in excellent condition.  The quality is also good as none of the brushes had any loose heads, as I have seen reported on other brushes in other reviews. I have been using the set for two months, and still no loosening. Brushes pick up product easily yet deposit on the skin in a very controlled manned. The variety of brushes is impressive, helpful, and fun. The different eye make - up brushes enable unique designs. If I had any complaint at all, I would want the powder brush to be a little softer, but other than that, they meet all my expectations and goals. Aside from being a great set of brushes,  they are sleek and attractive in appearance.</li>
            <li> Nicely packaged and arrived on time. Purchased for daughter(22) she loves them. Makeup goes on well. Brushes are soft and wash well.</li>
            <li> high quality. i am really pleased with this purchase</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an actress and bought these brushes to use for performance make-up. So far, they are SO AWESOME. It&#x27;s such a great value and I have rec&#x27;d them to all the girls in my dressing room!</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these, one for me and one for my little sister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She and I are real impressed with them.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are super soft and no shedding!&lt;br /&gt;The pouch does have an odor but that went away after a day.</li>
            <li> Much nicer than I expected!</li>
            <li> These brushes are awesome! Very good quality. Love the wrapped carry case.</li>
            <li> Very good quality brushes, good blending ability, no shedding, soft and durable.</li>
            <li> Great variety and good quality for the price.  Excellent stocking stuffers for the girls!</li>
            <li> Great Product for good price!</li>
            <li> Perfect. .I got the set,  just before a trip so they pack great.  My sister is a make up artist and she was extremely impressed.  It does more than enough for me but I don&#x27;t feel overwhelmed...The quality of the brushes makes me want to use them all. Review comes from a make up wearer during the work week and going out for special occasions</li>
            <li> It was wonderful...I loved the makeup set, I couldn&#x27;t have spent my money better</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. Seem to be good quality.  I was just looking for everyday personal use.</li>
            <li> Nice brush set for a great price!</li>
            <li> These are HORRIBLE brushes!! Save your money don&#x27;t bother with these. I washed mine like always before I use them and they didn&#x27;t even last through their first wash. It was just sad. You get what you pay for... these are junk.</li>
            <li> Quality brushes for a great price!</li>
            <li> Wonderful set of brushes - love them!  Threw away all previously owned brushes.</li>
            <li> Great quality, fast delivery, my mom loved them (it was a gift).</li>
            <li> Bought a set for my girlfriend, who&#x27;s a bit of a makeup fiend. She noted how high quality the brushes were, commenting on the balanced weight and fineness of the hairs for even distribution. She uses them almost every day and has pretty much relegated her other brushes to the bottom drawer of shame. Overall, the set is an excellent value and makes for a happy SO.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great.</li>
            <li> I love these makeup brushes!  They are good quality and just the right amount of each size for my makeup needs.</li>
            <li> These brushes are a MUA&#x27;s dream!! The case they come in is just beautiful. The brushes themselves are natural hair, super soft, and blend flawlessly. As a makeup artist I own a ton of brushes, this Karity Cosmetics set is right up there with Sigma and Mac. There was no shedding during application, and no shedding during cleaning. These are high quality, professional brushes without a doubt. I can&#x27;t wait to order another set!</li>
            <li> Very impressed by this product!</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying these brushes! Nice soft bristles. Great pickup and delivery. The only reason I&#x27;m not giving 5 stars is beause I couldn&#x27;t figure out what a couple of them are for.</li>
            <li> I received the brushes today and As I ripped the envelope they were mailed in, I got a sudden wiff of a strong odor. Not sure what it is, so I took off the plastic and it turned out it was coming from the bag or brush holder. Horrible. The brushes were fine but I tossed it out the bag. That&#x27;s how bad the smell was. I don&#x27;t know if there is anything that can be done about that because it was a shame to throw it out!!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product. She was very surprised by my surprise gift.</li>
            <li> Well made - beautiful brushes.  The pouch does have a strong smell of paint but aired out overnight.  The bristles are soft and hold shadow well - face, powder and foundation brushes are on par with items costing 4x or more</li>
            <li> the brushes are nice very good quality but it has a strong paint smell but another then that brush are very soft and good quality</li>
            <li> The bristles are low quality and it irritates my skin when I use it. Not very soft.</li>
            <li> An unbelievable price for this high quality brush.  My make-up looked great!</li>
            <li> Theses brushes are amazing. I would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> Good quality for s decent price</li>
            <li> Fantastic quality!  A total value!</li>
            <li> These brushes are great! They have a pretty strong plastic smell when first opened but just let them air out a few days and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
            <li> Very nice set of brushes. When I first received them, the case had a very strong odor (like paint fumes), but after I let it air or in my garage overnight, the smell had gone. The brushes themselves are good quality, especially for the price. Very sturdy and soft bristles. I haven&#x27;t had trouble with bristles falling out yet, and I&#x27;ve had them about a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend washing the brushes in soapy water before use, and letting the case sit somewhere for a day or two to let the odor dissipate.</li>
            <li> This is my first complete set of brushes so I don&#x27;t have much to compare them to, but they seem great. They&#x27;re must better than using the brushes that come with the makeup. And I haven&#x27;t bought brush cleaner, but I used regular antibacterial dial soap and they were still soft after they dried. Also I haven&#x27;t visited their site to get instructions for using each brush, but I plan to...and it&#x27;s nice of them to provide that information!</li>
            <li> They are amazing I have used them frequently and none of the hair came out . They are also verry easy to clean &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li> Love, love, love these brushes!! Amazing product and the price is right! Go get a set!</li>
            <li> Nice variety of brushes, large and small.  I am enjoying experimenting with all of them.  Will say that there eye &#x27;crease&#x27; brush could be softer to swipe back and forth on the arc of the creases</li>
            <li> Item exactly as described - Super Fast Shipping</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a single brush at the local Family Dollar store for $3. The bristles are falling out and I cant keep the lids on the ends. I saw this set and for the price, decided to try it. These brushes are awesome. They&#x27;re very soft, the bristles do not fall out and they feel good against your face. They come in a very nice vinyl type carry case. They seem to be very well made and will last a long time. This is the last set I need to buy. I love these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received these at a discounted price, I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience.</li>
            <li> Really great set of brushes.  Work very well and easy to clean, the case is very handy and a perfect size.</li>
            <li> The set is just ok. For the money you pay, you get a good variety and not so good quality.</li>
            <li> The chemical smell when you open these is horrible.  I almost returned them based on that.  However, I realized that the smell is from the plastic case &amp; handles,not the brushes themselves.  I washed them &amp; that helped quite a bit.  The brushes themselves are decent.  A great buy, for sure.  I will continue to use them &amp; am happy with them in general.</li>
            <li> I bought this cosmetic brush set a few weeks ago, and I have no complaints so far. Good quality for the price and very soft. The only reason I gave them 4 stars is because they are not labeled. I&#x27;m not an expert when it comes to applying make up, so it would have helped me if they were labeled. Other than that little inconvenience I would buy this again if I needed too.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these!&lt;br /&gt;Much better than I&#x27;ve ever had before.</li>
            <li> I just received my 12 makeup brushes and am thrilled to toss out all of my old ones. The price was right and the brushes work well with any of the brands I currently use. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Brush bristles fall out frequently.</li>
            <li> Nice, soft brushes. Great, organized carrying case. My only minor complaint would be I&#x27;d like it to include a foundation brush. Overall, great buy and worth the money.</li>
            <li> not great brushes. I dont think I have used a single one more than once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get what you pay for really.</li>
            <li> Actually, I bought these for my daughter to use and intend to give them to her for this next Christmas.  I thought they looked like a great set of makeup brushes and I will probably buy a set for myself later on, as my own are getting old.  I like what I see!</li>
            <li> the brushes were great there was a lot of different sizes to choose from</li>
            <li> good set with all of the brushes you would need. My favorite is the conturing brush, works amazing. The other facial brushes do shed, especially when you first use them. For me, I just needed a few more new inexpensive brushes for the time being, and its a great set for that and especailly travel. Can&#x27;t wait to use it for spring break (:</li>
            <li> These were really soft brushes, definitely a good start up set. Loved the carrying case, however I felt the handle of the brushes were a bit too long, which I was not a fan of. The little pouch did have a funky smell to it upon arrival, but it quickly went away. The bigger brushes came with plastic protectors, which I thought was a very smart idea to keep those things in shape! I ended up returning them since I actually owned very similar brushes. But would definitely recommend to someone needing to start up their collection!</li>
            <li> Awesome for a beginner, complete set. Use everyday!</li>
            <li> I love my new brush set definitely recommend !</li>
            <li> Gteat quality.......I  liked them so much bought several for gifts!</li>
            <li> I purchased this set for my wife.  She  is very, very happy with the quality.  She has been using this for a couple of days only.  I will provide more feedback later.</li>
            <li> it was purchased for a gift</li>
            <li> Really love them! Awesome shipping time and product!</li>
            <li> These brushes are high quality, I ordered them for my mom and she really loved them. It was a great purchase!</li>
            <li> Great brushes for the price. I would buy them again. I get a flawless brush stroke every time. And so far not much &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> They stink of some chemicals, it can be the paint...</li>
            <li> Good quality and price too</li>
            <li> this is my first set of makeup brushes and i don&#x27;t regret getting this. So soft and feels good on my skin. looks high end but got it for fraction of a price. love it!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know what to expect especially for so cheap, best brushes, I&#x27;ve used ever, now I wish I had gotten the bigger 32 brush set, my bare minerals brushes were not as nice as these, now I wonder if karity makes a kabuki brush, and BTW you just can&#x27;t beat bare minerals foundation matte ,actually i sleep in it!</li>
            <li> Great quality and price.</li>
            <li> Definitely loved these brushes. I have had them for some time and use them everyday. The bristles hold well. Two brushes have come off at the metal end from the wood end, but a little glue fixed that right up. Worth the price, definitely.</li>
            <li> The brushes and pouch have a very strong smell. I&#x27;m sure some soap and water would help with this. The brushes work great, though! And I really like the pouch.</li>
            <li> I love this Brush set my very first set as I&#x27;m beginning to experience in makeup and they were the cheap way to go. Excellent brush set for the price, but anyone looking to purchase this set I warn you about a distinctive smell to it as some people are very sensitive to smelly makeup products but if you can get pass that......This is an Excellent Brush Set!</li>
            <li> These brushes were super cheap (price wise) and I thought they might be really crappy too, but they were actually good quality! Nice carrying case too. Thumbs up</li>
            <li> It is okay except some brushes were made with other materials. I like it</li>
            <li> I bought two sets for my mother and I, and was a little hesitant about the reviews saying they smelt bad. I received them very quick. Way earlier than i expected and when I opened the packaging, there was an oder but it wasn&#x27;t too bad. I let it air out for the night and they were perfect. My mom loved them too. And for the price, you cant beat a deal like this. Will buy more for my sisters :)</li>
            <li> These seem like quality brushes. The case however has a chemical odor. I love the brushes and you can get a list of what each brush is for online. Get rid of the case.</li>
            <li> This brush set is a great unbeatable value for the cost.  I love the texture of the natural bristles, the quality is high-end, they are easy&lt;br /&gt;to hold and feel great against my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a soft touch for a soft touch;  I wish I had ordered this set for gifts for friends....a fantastic price for this wonderful brush kit.</li>
            <li> These bristles are a bit more stiff and coarse than the synthetic that I am used to, but I like the firmness when applying my makeup. Great set for someone like me who doesn&#x27;t need so many different types of eyeshadow brushes. Small enough to travel with if I need it, I would recommend it if you like firmer bristles in your brushes.</li>
            <li> Brushes are a good beginners set</li>
            <li> Very nice brush set for a great price, a couple more than I use but it is a good array.  Will buy a couple more for gifts.</li>
            <li> I love these  brushes  good prices</li>
            <li> Looks cute! I haven&#x27;t tried them but the quality is really good! I love it!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes , I would recommend this product to my friends :)</li>
            <li> Definately happy with these awesome brushes</li>
            <li> The brushes are great.  They are exactly as described.  I have had no problem with any of the brushes losing bristles. One reviewer said there was a smell, I experienced very little smell.  It was the case and as soon as I opened it and laid it for an hour or so it was gone.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes. Good quality</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with the quality of these brushes. I really had trouble finding the right brushes for the look I want to produce. These are it!</li>
            <li> Brushes are not soft. They do not work very well.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush set for my roommate for Christmas because she needed a set, and she absolutely loves them. There is a large variety of brushes and the quality is great. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> A great value for the money, wished a guide would be included as to what each brush should be used for.</li>
            <li> the quality is ok for everyday. good product for the price.</li>
            <li> This brush set is amazingly sufficient for it&#x27;s price and even better quality. I use the brushes everyday and there is minimal shedding. The only bad thing about this set was the initial smell of the package. But after a couple of days, the smell faded.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes. I mainly use the foundation and blush brushes. The foundation brush results in good even coverage.&lt;br /&gt;The brush package has a plasticy smell that won&#x27;t go away. The brushes don&#x27;t smell, just the package. Just something to consider - doesn&#x27;t actually effect the brushes.</li>
            <li> They started off great but once you washed them they started to fall apart....some lasted longer than others</li>
            <li> They work very well for applying makeup.  We used them right after we bought them for a large wedding party.  Very happy with our purchase.</li>
            <li> Every where I look there are individual makeup brushes being sold for over $20 a piece. That to me is outrageous. This set has almost all the brushes I need and they are of good quality. Not to mention the carrying case is included. If you&#x27;re not a professional makeup artist these brushes will do just fine!</li>
            <li> the feel of these brushes is nice but they leave alot of broken bristles.</li>
            <li> I usually spend $20 to $30 dollars on single brushes and these work just as great . They just have a plastic stentch, that I am sure will wash away .</li>
            <li> Terrible brushes. I was excited to purchase them after all the positive reviews, I should have read the negative ones, which I have all the same problems as: terrible chemical smell, the brush bristles are too hard and don&#x27;t blend worth a damn. I wound up going to Walmart and buying Ecotools which are way better than these. Won&#x27;t be buying any make up brushes online again because of this.</li>
            <li> Very nice brushes. They arrived well, all the bristles in place. The bag for the brushes looks pretty. Overall really nice brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> These brushes are top notch! I needed a new set of brushes for my make-up and these fit the bill perfectly! They feel well constructed and I haven&#x27;t had any bristles fall out yet. There&#x27;s a wide variety of tips and shapes for everything you could possibly want to put on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers have said that this product has a weird smell. This is true, and mostly smells like the leather pouch that it came in was straight from a paint factory. The brushes themselves don&#x27;t smell, and the smell of the pouch fades a few days after opening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, would buy again.</li>
            <li> These brushes are excellent! I have several different brushes and these are just as good as the high end expensive ones! Definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> i really like these brushes for the price the work well for the price it&#x27;s a great value. nice soft brushes. the carry case is great for traveling and fits other brushes</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase from Karity and they didn&#x27;t disappoint.  The brushes are great quality at a great price. Very soft with no shedding and the pouch is great for travelling.  I would definitely recommend and would buy again.</li>
            <li> Excellent brushes! Gives my make up look more professional polished finish. I use it with higher end Mac or drug store brand makeup and it make the drugstore makeup look way more controlled and the Mac makeup looks over the top good with these brushes. The packaging rolls up for easy storage. And best of all I experience no shedding with these brushes.</li>
            <li> Excellent! I love them!!</li>
            <li> Love love these brushes :-) #cheap and #amazing.</li>
            <li> The product delivered on-time and the quality doesn&#x27;t look bad for the price but my onlyproblem is about its smell, both the brushes and the bag have the very sharp smell of synthetic materials and although I put them in front of fresh air for some days, the smell still remains. If you are sensitive about smells like me be aware of this problem</li>
            <li> Leather from China! You guys know the pouch is probably made from puppies they hit over the head or cut their throats so they can skin them and make this product right?</li>
            <li> Decent quality brushes for the price</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this item, the brushes are good weight and the bristles aren&#x27;t like silk, but they&#x27;re nicer than anything you&#x27;d get at CVS or Walgreens for the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would help if the item included information on each brush and its suggested uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall really happy.</li>
            <li> Really like the set. Rolls up nicely to keep brushes protected.</li>
            <li> Very rarely do you get quality at a low price.  These brushes are exquisete, accurate and amazing to use. It was everything i hoped for when purchasing these.</li>
            <li> These brushes are made of great quality. The strong bristles hold firm and the softer ones are very delicate on the skin. It helps for an even distribution of the make-up. The pouch had a strong \\&quot;factory acetone like\\&quot; odor to it at first, but it eventually faded.</li>
            <li> Very Good product for price.</li>
            <li> I love the pouch this came with. The brushes aren&#x27;t too course or soft and hold the makeup well. I feel that they gave me great value for the low price. There was nothing this cheap as and as good at Walmart or kmart. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Many choices in this pack. Great choice!</li>
            <li> Came in a nice pouch that will keep everything organized. Great quality brushes.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my daughter for a Christmas gift.  She&#x27;s a make up snob and loved it!</li>
            <li> For the price this is great.  I have purchased expensive sets and brushes thinking $$$ mean better throughout the years, never again.  This is well made, applies make up with ease and precision.  I have bought a few as gifts.</li>
            <li> For the price, this brush set is okay. I have not used all 12 brushes, so I can only review based on the ones I have used. I have used all but two of the small brushes and the largest brush. I did wash them before use, to get rid of any pieces that may fall out. The ones I have used have not really shed during use. The largest one is just not stiff enough to really apply powder very well; I wish it was just a tad bit better. Also, I have found that some of the smaller ones work great if you are using with some sort of cream type cosmetic, cream eye shadow, cream contour, concealer, etc., but require a lot more application with a powder cosmetic to get the desired color. For what I use them for, for the most part I am happy. I would recommend them to anyone who does primarily use liquid or cream cosmetics, with only a few powder cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Brush doesn&#x27;t shed, distributes powders evenly. Great purchase, especially for the price. The case makes me feel fancy.</li>
            <li> I just received them and have been using them every day.  They are large and sturdy.  Truly like them and would recommend highly.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! There was a smell when they first arrived, but after a couple of days the smell dissipated.  Happy Customer :-)</li>
            <li> These brushes are awesome!!  The price is great so I decided to give them a try. They truly exceeded my expectations. The quality is great and the variety makes it worth every penny. Highly recommend !!</li>
            <li> Just love these brushes...super soft bristles even though they look hoarse&lt;br /&gt;Love love the big powder brush, the eyeshadow brushes are nice too&lt;br /&gt;the leather smell doesn&#x27;t bother me too much and I actually really like the case</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter and she likes them!</li>
            <li> Look to be great quality brushes. GF loves them! She says the&#x27;re soft and apply evenly.</li>
            <li> Very nice set of brushes that I purchased for my daughter.  She loves them!</li>
            <li> The case had an awful smell to it. In addition to throwing the case away, I had to get rid of  most of the brushes. They were breaking my face out. The eye brushes are not that bad though.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! They are amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful set of brushes ,Great quality!! Best buy for your dollars,Highly Recommend them.</li>
            <li> works great no bristle shedding so far. If you don&#x27;t know what brushes are for you can easily find on their website.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, would buy again!!!</li>
            <li> Brushes work great and were shipped very fast. Only complaint is the smell of the case it smells very chemically so I removed the brushes and put them in a different holder.</li>
            <li> Some were awesome, some were meh. They had a very strong smell when opened. The larger brushes were more flexible than I like, and the fan brush had to be flatironed after washing. The concealer and eye brushes, I love. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat them honestly, they&#x27;re well worth the $12 I paid.</li>
            <li> Great quality, variety, love my kit!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very useful, I like it very much</li>
            <li> Love brushes and best of all great price! Even had a case to hold them all</li>
            <li> These brushes are great. Highly recommend this set. I&#x27;m just starting to get into more complex make-up routines and these have been a wonderful start. Great quality, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Good brushes for the price. Especially the tiny ones. Definitely worth it for a beginners brush kit.</li>
            <li> These brushes are soft and apply the makeup well, but they smell like chemicals and shed like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. After using them you look like a cat just rubbed itself on your shirt. I wouldn&#x27;t buy them again, but I&#x27;ll probably continue to use them.</li>
            <li> I love my new brushes!  I have been using these for a few weeks and they seem no worse for the wear.  No problems whatsoever with bristles falling out.  These are a very nice quality.  They do have a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; smell when you first open them but it didn&#x27;t bother me and didn&#x27;t last too long.  I highly recommend and would consider purchasing more for gifts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wearing make-up, but I thought these brushes were great. Mine had no strong odors, and I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to that. One of the brushes came with some glue on the tip, which I couldn&#x27;t remove easily. I was hoping to get that single brush replaced, but the company actually refunded me the whole purchase! 5 stars alone for customer service! Would recommend these brushes. Great price for so many brushes!</li>
            <li> The faux leather does have a funky smell but that dissipates after a while These are decent brushes, excellent set for the price.</li>
            <li> Very nice brushes for the price. The only thing I found was there are so many different brushes, most I won&#x27;t use, but then I&#x27;m not really into make-up and I don&#x27;t think that the amount of brushes is a negative thing.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. Very soft brissles, keeps its shape and texture when washed, and they are very good quality.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we needed!</li>
            <li> Received my brushes fast and I love them! Easy to apply makeup and there&#x27;s enough brushes for every need. The powders apply to the eyes, etc rather than stick to the bristles themselves so there is less waste.</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I expected.  My daughter loves them.</li>
            <li> Good quality. Fast shipping and professional attitude. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Great assortment of quality brushes for a great price.  Put them to use doing a variety of Halloween makeup designs this year with great success!  The case is also of good quality and will keep them safe and organized.  One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made in a while.</li>
            <li> These were a great price and everything that I was looking for!</li>
            <li> nice quality brushes, good value</li>
            <li> They are decent if you don&#x27;t want to spend too much money. But one was falling apart. The wood was coming off and the brissles were falling off as I used it on my face.</li>
            <li> Good quality. Used daily for several weeks already with no loose bristles. Pouch rolls up neatly to fit in case. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Good brushes, great price! I&#x27;m really happy I purchased these. I wash them regularly and they don&#x27;t get weird.</li>
            <li> Really great brushes (:</li>
            <li> Its great...i love it...</li>
            <li> I bought these for my wife.She was so satisfied with it that she ordered 11 sets more for her friends.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great! I use them everyday for a few months now and they are holding up beautifully. I feel like they make my makeup that much more natural looking. One of the best Amazon purchases I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the quality of the brushes. I haven&#x27;t had them for very long and they are already starting to need to be replaced, especially the larger brushes.</li>
            <li> The bristles fall out every now and again but great quality for the price</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter and she loves them.</li>
            <li> Love it love it!!! Awesome find!! Great price!!!</li>
            <li> Good Quality but very light bristles. If you like the hairs on the brush to be very thin and light this will be good for you.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty nice brushes for being so cheap I paid nearly 50 dollars for another set of brushed I had and these work just about the same if not better I would definitely recommend purchasing</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, these brushes are amazingly soft! They are sturdy and seem to be of good quality. At this price, these are a steal!</li>
            <li> These brushes are perfect! Much better quality than expected for this price. Such a great deal for an awesome product! The carrying bag is very nicely made and keeps all the brushes in place. The brushes are very soft as well.</li>
            <li> Great quality. Very excellent deal for the price. I am excited to finally have a full set of brushes to call my own.  The case was a little bit stinky at first, but over time that went away. I am still enjoying the brushes and they appear to be made well and will likely last a long time.</li>
            <li> i liked at first but then started to shed.</li>
            <li> Yes, I loved it and enjoying it.  Wow, I have now a complete set of make up brush without slashing my wallet.  It works so well with my new set of make up. It is worth buying. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes</li>
            <li> I bought this to give to my girlfriend. She&#x27;s been hinting to this for so long.</li>
            <li> These brushes are ok. I am not wowed but for the price I can&#x27;t complain. I wouldn&#x27;t have paid the undiscounted retail price they claim. the case smells strongly of vinyl and it&#x27;s pretty bulky. the brushes are decent quality and do what they need to do. It&#x27;s a lot of brushes for the money.</li>
            <li> The brushes looked great; however, the smell of the brushes and pouch was absolutely disgusting - it even gave me a headache. It smells like a harsh chemical - don&#x27;t want to put something that smells this terrible anywhere near my face. I will be returning these.</li>
            <li> Had to retun these due to a strong pungent petroleum smell. Would not suggest you purchase these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite new to make-up application and decided to purchase a set of brushes.  I&#x27;d seen several videos that used brushes I&#x27;d never even heard of, so a variety pack sounded like the best option to me.  I tried one brush and it applied smoothly and quickly - 100000x better than applicators that usually come free with make-up purchases.  Beautiful packaging; sturdy brushes.  Also has descriptions of each brush with links to their website to help out newbies like me.</li>
            <li> these brushes are really soft and brushes on makeup evenly and quite beautifully. The bag is convenient for storing as well as for travel. My only complaint is that the product came smelling quite strongly of the warehouse or wherever it was stored but it aired out after a few days.</li>
            <li> As a person who just started using makeup full time this set is perfect. I know what brushes are for what, and I enjoy the fact that I have a wrap up case to put them in. This makes them a lot easier to access and allows me to put on my make up a lot quicker. The brushes are nice and soft and I haven had any issues with the falling apart. It also helps keep them soft when I wash them with baby shampoo.</li>
            <li> I purchased one set for myself and have also given 2 sets as gifts- fantastic quality and variety for the price. We all love them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an owner of both expensive brushes and really cheap brushes. So far, I&#x27;ve been thoroughly impressed by the quality of these brushes. Honestly, I thought the pouch it came with was super tacky so that&#x27;s not much of an added benefit. But the brushes themselves don&#x27;t shed aggressively (a couple of bristles may come off, but nothing shocking or that would make me want to return them). They do have a chemical smell, but I got rid of it by soaking the handles of the brushes in a solution of water, dr. bronners castille soap, and a little bit of vinegar.  I did this over night (just put the solution in a glass jar and put the brushes handle side down in the jar) and the smell was gone the next day. Love my brushes and certainly will be buying these a gifts for makeup loving friends in the future.</li>
            <li> they are better than I expected</li>
            <li> Great brushes! Could not beat the price.</li>
            <li> Nice quality. I would recommend theses brushes. Great brushes,  especially for the price. No shedding and they are so soft.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with this purchase!!! They pick up product very well and the brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li> Nice quality for the price.  These were just what I was looking for, and I&#x27;ve been enjoying them very much.</li>
            <li> Remember when plastic was touted as durable?  These are not.  One fall, and my eyebrow brush is losing its bristles, all over my newly made face, due to cheap and brittle plastic.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this refuse.</li>
            <li> The brushes have held up well for the most part, but after 6 months of use some little hairs are falling out of the bigger brushes and they also are not as soft as some other cheap brushes that I have.</li>
            <li> This brush set was recommended to me by a friend and I recommend them also!  This comprehensive set includes all the brushes that I regularly use. There was a slight laquer odor when they first arrived. I unrolled and removes the plastic packaging and the odor was gone quickly. They hold up well to washing and I have not lost many bristles.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them much, but when I have I have loved them. Such a good variety of brushes. I would recommend these!</li>
            <li> These brushes are perfect! My wife has been bugging me to let her spend an arm and a leg on new brushes from Sephora. At $30 each that is ridiculous. I got here these brushes in hopes to curb her appetite for expensive brushes. It has worked, the brushes are super soft and do a great job of picking the make up up and applying it to the face. She is extremely happy with the product and I saved a ton of money. That&#x27;s an all around win if you ask me!</li>
            <li> So I read the reviews before I bought these and had a pretty good idea of what they might be. The first thing is that the bag that it comes in DOES smell awful! Like realllllllly awful migraine inducing plastic chemical smell. So after I threw that away and took the trash out to get the smell out of my house- the smell was gone and the brushes are great. I have used them for about a month now- the first day some brittles came loose, but after that and after even washing them a couple times there is no major brittle loss. So if you want some really cheap- but nice make-up brushes then this is a good buy. Just take my advice and throw away that bag.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price. The brushes work well and are really soft on your face. Extra bonus is they don&#x27;t tend to shed on your face when youuse them eieither.</li>
            <li> Set provides good variety of kits. I am happy with the quality for the given price. I won&#x27;t need any kits for a long time.</li>
            <li> It is a very nice set. I love these brushes. They are very good quality; soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Got them just 4 days after I purchased them, very strong chemical smell..I am very excited to try them out but once that smell goes away</li>
            <li> I read reviews before that said the brushes had a funny smell to it but my brush set is perfect. No smell and a good variety of some good quality brushes.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! I use Bare Minerals makeup and although they have nice brushes too they seem to need to be cleaned a lot. These are still soft on my skin, my only issue is that I have been using them for a few weeks now and some of the bristles are falling out. Not a lot, just a few every now and then but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve ever have a brush that didn&#x27;t loose a few...</li>
            <li> The brushes are high quality, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> These brushes are great! They arrived the day, it said they would. Very sturdy and pretty!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! Great value, good quality, great customer service.</li>
            <li> Great set! Really great buy for the price as well!</li>
            <li> Love the pouches, soft brushes. Great value.</li>
            <li> These do shed. I recommend these brushes for those who are beginning to learn. Otherwise, you&#x27;ll just become irritated with the rate of shedding. Can&#x27;t beat the price though!</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Order for a Christmas present so I don&#x27;t know if my 22 year old will like or not but they appear to be beautiful brushes, very soft &amp; case is very nice!!</li>
            <li> These are a gift, so I have not used them to give it a five star rating, but these are fantastic for a steal.  The brush selection is great, and they have a very soft, professional feel.  I think my niece will be very excited to receive these.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter&#x27;s makeup kit and I love to use them as well</li>
            <li> Great deal on these brushes and also great quality.</li>
            <li> the brushes are amazing! and very good quality i can&#x27;t tell any difference with an expensive brand!</li>
            <li> First Impression- When i opened it they smelled like cement, i washed them and let them air dry. The smell has lowered more than 60%. i assume i have to wash them one more time before the smell is gone.They feel very nice and sturdy. they  do shed, but all brushes do (not a lot of shedding just a little). The only thing i am unhappy with is how they look. They look exactly like the picture and they look cheap. (i guess they are since i only paid ten when they were on sale). The brushes are soft and have the perfect amount of firmness. They apply quite well (not my #1 but pretty good). Overall i think they were an amazing deal. But i wouldnt pay more than 20 bucks.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!!!!  They are excellent quality, and the assortment is great.  They are all neat in a nice case, and work perfectly.  The price was great and they were delivered ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li> I would most definitely recommend these brushes to anyone looking for makeup application!  For the price, they are absolutely great.  I&#x27;ve learned to do a lot more with my eye makeup because I have these :-)</li>
            <li> These brushes are a great quality. Admittedly, they are my first set, but they work flawlessly. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great brush set, soft, works well and the price was great.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes three years ago and I still use them to this day. They have not shed any bristles, but the handles have come a little loose from regular use. Other than that, they have held up beautifully. You can&#x27;t beat the quality you get for the price</li>
            <li> Pretty great variety of decent brushes for little $</li>
            <li> Wonderful brushes! Don&#x27;t hesitate....</li>
            <li> My first brush set and I love it. Soft bristles and picks up product easily. Great value for price. Good packaging and lovely design.</li>
            <li> i love it! all the brushes are so useful and everything blends really well together with the brush!!</li>
            <li> Great brush set, use it all the time now when I need to go out.</li>
            <li> Great Brushes! Bought some for my sisters too!! They r a must have :)</li>
            <li> These are awesome brushes! I&#x27;m not one who uses makeup all too often but for a beginner these are great! My friend also uses these brushes for me and says they&#x27;re good! I would recommend to someone!</li>
            <li> LOVE this brush set!!  Was way better than I dreamed it would be.  If you want an amazing brush set this is the one for you!!</li>
            <li> High quality brushes. They are soft, they don&#x27;t shed. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Great deal especially for the price!!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the quality of these brushes! I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price but took a chance and was blown away by what came in the mail! No shedding bristles, very soft, good selection, and sturdy handles! I ordered 2 sets and would highly recommend these brushes to anyone.</li>
            <li> Nice set.  Hope to use for quite a while.</li>
            <li> I love my brushes.  They are heaven sent.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Love them work really well. They were so cheap. Worth every penny . Thank you. I love doing my make up now</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my 16 year old daughter. She has nothing but great things to say about these brushes. Very high quality at a super awesome price! Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to purchase makeup brushes :)</li>
            <li> Very good quality for the price!</li>
            <li> The brushes are a great quality.  Ive got a wedding coming up and Im updating my makeup bag. I&#x27;m really happy with them.</li>
            <li> Great brushes. Very professional feeling bristles and great price. I love the pouch they came in as well.</li>
            <li> After using these brushes i cant use any other they&#x27;re soft and it spreads the makeup on even so there is no spots on your face. im so so happy with them and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!!! deff ganna buy more</li>
            <li> Item in good shape and very complete with all these brushes. Good quality but I don&#x27;t understand why one looks different. The hair of brushes are not as soft as I though but seem to do their job.</li>
            <li> Boy! This set came with so many brushes, I don&#x27;t know what to use them all for! The big blush brush has worked excellently in evenly applying brush to all the desired facial regions with no spotting, blotching or streaking. Some of the smaller brushes have strong yet supple qualities which make them ideal for applying more delicate and intricate forms of makeup in a non irritating, precise fashion. The carrying case feels and looks high quality and sports a sort of worn leather look which feels very premium given the affordable price. I rate this product overall an A+ for its ease of use, sophisticated design and large array of brushes which I haven&#x27;t been able to find elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;And who knows.... Maybe now I can take up painting on the side ;)</li>
            <li> Great brushes for the money.  I would recommend them.  Great gift for your girlfriends.</li>
            <li> Brushes were cheap, pouch was nothing more than plastic and the entire set had a funky odor, so I returned it.</li>
            <li> My wife was always saying she needed different brushes for different make up applications. I don&#x27;t get it at all. I&#x27;m a guy that does not wear any lol. But she was spending money left and right on different makeup applicators. So I bought her this. She seems very pleased and says they work great. It came with more brushes than she can actually use. Worth the buy for the extra money we saved and the time saved with her getting ready to go places lol.</li>
            <li> I really like these Brushes. Very nice set and a very nice price.</li>
            <li> These do shed......  I have to tweeze the bristles off my face if I use the foundation brush, but I still use several of the brushes and for the price they were a fair product I would say.  But given the opportunity to purchase again, I would try another product.</li>
            <li> The brushes were exactly as described. Very pleased</li>
            <li> I just received mine!&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely satisfied. Two thumbs up!&lt;br /&gt;I love everything about this.&lt;br /&gt;Look no further. This is a must buy. You can&#x27;t beat the price.&lt;br /&gt;A little extra cash for two day shipping was so worth it.</li>
            <li> These brushes work great! Fast shipping too! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Good quality!  Love them! Would purchase more at this site!</li>
            <li> They are good brushes, soft and nice quality bristles and handles.  My one dislike is that the bristles in the bigger brushes (blush, powder, etc) are a bit thin.  I like big full brushes, and these ones are not quite full enough.  I am still happy I bought them, especially for the price!  On a side note, the case they came in was pretty chemical smelling so I threw it out, but the brushes themselves were perfect.</li>
            <li> My Daughter loves them. She can now throw away the really old brushes she has had for years.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom because she has been wanting some brushes for a while. She not a professional at makeup she just wears it to work and these get the job done perfectly for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: These do have a strong smell when you first buy them but take it out of the plastic for a few hours and its practically gone.</li>
            <li> The brushes are ok, the bag smells terrible and feels cheap. It came with a card directing you to a web site for tips on using the brushes, but the website is invalid. My daughter was very disappointed with that.</li>
            <li> I purchase 5 sets for daughter, daughters-in-law and step-daughter.  Ordered one more for myself.  Would buy them again in a heartbeat!</li>
            <li> This is such a wonderful set at a great price! It has everything I needed and the brush quality is surprisingly good.</li>
            <li> Very good quality!  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Wife absolutely loved brushes and they got here super fast</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my daughter. She has been asking for new brushes and I was excited to find these. She absolutely LOVES them. they are so soft. It is a great set for travel and every day.</li>
            <li> Great product, nice quality!</li>
            <li> These brushes were so much nicer than the picture. The smell of the cases were a little strong but went away quickly after opening (leathery smell; not offensive). I would but them again. Gave as Christmas presents this year.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! Great price and easy to store in the pouch they come in.</li>
            <li> Good brushes, came quickly, fulfill their purpose</li>
            <li> These brushes are OK based on the price that I paid for them.  I ordered them in order to begin testing out different makeup for my wedding day.  They bristles fall out constantly but i&#x27;ll probably only use them for the next month or so and then look for something more quality.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price</li>
            <li> good brushes, adorable kit, perfect for travel</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes ! They arrive at time in perfect condition. I bouth this brushes because a would like exchange my old ones. I got nice, soft and hight cuality set.</li>
            <li> I simply adore these brushes! They&#x27;re incredibly soft for being synthetic brushes. I do wish that they would label the brush types instead of redirecting you to their website. I highly suggest these for those who want quality brushes for a great price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any issues with any bristles falling out. They&#x27;e very easy to clean, and they apply makeup effortlessly!</li>
            <li> The brush handles are really thin, I prefer mine to be a little thicker. The case that they are in is nice and rolls out and ties up. The brushes themselves are ok, not great, but usable. I probably would try something different next time.</li>
            <li> Great brushes and an even better price.</li>
            <li> It was a gift and they love the quality of the brushes.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using makeup brushes. I like the eye brushes a lot.. I think the face brushes could be softer. The case has a very strong smell. It is very nice though. So be prepared to air it out a few days if you&#x27;re sensitive to smells. Overall it was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice brush set and carrying case.</li>
            <li> good brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> am rating this as 5 start because its one of the best set you can get at that price. with the price i thought it wont be good but to my surprise this is so good with make up and barely falls out. i thought about getting a mac brush but with these, i no longer need mac brush. this is perfect and for the price is a give away. i recommend this to people.</li>
            <li> Great quality, fast shipping</li>
            <li> I like these brushes overall, but they do lose a lot of bristles with use. Cleaning with a mixture of dish soap and olive oil works really well, it doesn&#x27;t make them lose additional bristles.&lt;br /&gt;Good mixture of brush sizes.&lt;br /&gt;I still use them everyday.</li>
            <li> nice good quality had in literally 2 days.</li>
            <li> great value for your buck.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and as stated.  However, when I opened the pouch to check out the brushes there is a very strong aroma of what I think is varnish.  These are a Christmas gift so I won&#x27;t know how they perform until my daughter try&#x27;s them.</li>
            <li> Great quality starter brush set.</li>
            <li> Awesome value especially for this price! Would order again.</li>
            <li> Good condition. Great price.</li>
            <li> Great set of brushes for the price. Bought them for my daughter for Christmas and she loved them</li>
            <li> Great Deal and starter for anyone experiencing with make-up. Bought these brushes for my daughter and she loved them. Quality brushes!!!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase. It has a nice feel to it. Brushes appear to be of good quality. The case works well. I would recommend to others and purchase again.</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes as a gift off my sister&#x27;s wish list. They were received very quickly &amp; she loves them!</li>
            <li> These are absolutely wonderful, fine quality brushes.  I ordered three sets, 2 as gifts and 1 for myself.  I would recommend these.</li>
            <li> I purchased these as a gift. When opening package had a VERY strong plastic smell (case is kind of cheap). The brushes seemed VERY nice though. I am considering buying another set of these and just getting another case for them. The brushes were a fantastic value.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter.  She was beyond thrilled and said the only problem was that she didn&#x27;t know what all the brushes were used for.  She did find out and is even more glamorous than before.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my wife and she loves them. She like high quality brushes too...</li>
            <li> Great starter set. I&#x27;m not sure how long they&#x27;ll last. I&#x27;ll be sure to update my review.</li>
            <li> Great quality for a great price!</li>
            <li> These brushes exceeded my expectations. For some reason i thought they will be plastic because of the white labels in the middle. they are not. Great quality brushes for this price is amazing. The large shadow brush looks and feel different. I am very pleased. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I am using this kind of thing first time.&lt;br /&gt;After i m using it i gonna send some comments.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> Really can&#x27;t go wrong with these brushes.  They come in a handy roll up leather like pouch; very convenient for taking with you for the weekend, they are soft and the bristles seem to be well attached.  The price is what really sets them apart, at a little over a dollar a piece...ummm, what are you waiting for?</li>
            <li> I think these professional studio quality makeup brushes are great.  I have complete control placing makeup where I want it to be applied.  This is my first experience with any type of makeup brush.  I think these will be great as a starter set for an ametuer makeup artist.</li>
            <li> they shed a lot and head of brush has fallen off a couple of mine.... contour and fan brush really good</li>
            <li> Great products at a great price. Smell like chemicals a bit, just a heads up if you are giving them as a gift. Otherwise, excellent</li>
            <li> Product got here super quick. And I&#x27;m really surprised with the quality.I&#x27;m a  begginer to using brushes so I guess you can say its a great starter kit.</li>
            <li> These were a gift for my grand daughter she absolutely loves them.</li>
            <li> These brushes are fantastic and very high quality. They came in a matter of days, and I was delighted with how soft and nice they are! They don&#x27;t shed at all, the case that they come in is lovely, and the price is right!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my wife as a present. She just loves them! They are soft and hold the powder and quality made.</li>
            <li> Purchased for wife as a Christmas gift. Brushes have a sort of &amp;#34;petroleum&amp;#34; smell when package first opened (see others&#x27; remarks), but goes away if left open to air after a few days. The smell is not too strong, but noticeable. Brushes are a great assortment, and very well made. Long handles provide great control, and are easy to handle. Variety of tips are probably more than needed (for most), but offer the opportunity to experiment with different shading styles. Bristles are soft, but hold up very well to pressure and use. Really an outstanding set for the money!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these - getting plenty of use out of them.</li>
            <li> Great price for great brushes!</li>
            <li> This is a great bargain for these professional brushes with a case!  Beautiful and perfect.  I love them.  You won&#x27;t regret your purchase!</li>
            <li> Obviously not designer brushes at this price, but honestly they do a pretty good job. There&#x27;s a wide variety of brushes for all your needs, and they look pretty nice, too. I wash them after each use before I put them away, but make sure they are fully dry before use (the bristles will clump together when wet). As a previous reviewer said, they had a VERY STRONG CHEMICAL SMELL when I got them in the mail. However, I spent some time washing the case carefully and each brush, and after a few days the smell was gone completely. Now, they&#x27;re a handy kit that I pull out when I&#x27;m feeling like doing some proper, fancy make-up. If you&#x27;re not the type who cares about brands and just wants every-day purpose brushes, these are the best buy there is!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. I have actually lost 2 in this short time but uts ok. Lol. I use them more than my mac or sigma brushes. Plus they are affordable. I reccommend these to any and everyone! I will most definitely be ordering more brushes again on the near future.</li>
            <li> These are very nice brushes</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I just got a batch that weren&#x27;t as good but these brushes are very hit and miss. There are some good eye brushes in this set, but the face brushes are not dependable. They shed after about three washes and they applied everything that was powder very patchy. They are very rough too. They have a scratchy, prickly feeling. I got some good use out of maybe 3 of these brushes. One was the bigger eye brush, the fan brush, and the thicker liner brush. Other than that, I got rid of them and went ahead and got some Zoeva brushes. I suggest investing in good brushes but trust me, I&#x27;m not throwing out $400+ for some sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. The selection of brushes is perfect for the basic that you need, and they work well.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, just what I needed.</li>
            <li> The number 1 thing a makeup brush is supposed to do is spread makeup evenly without leaving bristles on the skin. It spreads makeup evenly but if one chooses to use said brush with liquid foundation, the gave will be covered in brown bristles.</li>
            <li> These are great brushes - and plenty of them, especially for the price.  They work well, are soft and clean nicely in warm water with a little soap.  I bought one for myself and one for a friend.</li>
            <li> The brushes loose their bristles when using the larger brushes. The defining brushes work better &amp; apply makeup well enough.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my girlfriend and she loves them!</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes love love love them</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> Good quality and fast shipping! Bought for my wedding.</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes for a great price!</li>
            <li> Great brushes! Super soft!</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes, lovely varying case. Perfect for travel etc.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Exactly was was advertised. Happy so far with the product</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the Vanity makeup studio brush set. They was clean! In a nice travel bag. However, my only concern is that my blending brush just after three days of using it started losing strain of hair. Fix that and it will be a perfect ten!</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it but looks great can&#x27;t wait to try</li>
            <li> Got this item as a gift for my sister and she loves the set!</li>
            <li> Great brushes!! Great value</li>
            <li> Item(s) arrived fast and as described. However, the brushes have a strong odor. I have not put them to use yet but I will update when I do.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my wife for her birthday. She loves them and uses them daily.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft. I love them.</li>
            <li> Great quality.  Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Gave as gifts and they loved it. The initial smell when opening the packaging was over whelming.</li>
            <li> Great brushes for the price. Would definitely buy this again. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Not good at all, very dissapponted 😔</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft, I have never been much into being high-maintanence with my makeup but I needed some new brushes. I am glad I went with these, they are so great and don&#x27;t seem to be having many bristles falling out. Great brushes for a great price!</li>
            <li> great brushes for the price!</li>
            <li> bought for my daughter, likes the wide variety, soft bristles, work well for her&lt;br /&gt;would prefer the bristles were denser</li>
            <li> Bought these because of all the wonderful reviews. My price point at the time didn&#x27;t include any higher quality brushes, and I really wish I had just saved up more. These are HORRIBLE! They also have the worst chemical type of smell to them. Doesn&#x27;t retain product well enough to even apply make up, and they shed like crazy. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!</li>
            <li> Bought it for friend as a gift. She loves them</li>
            <li> Great set!  Does have a strong smell of plastic, however.  Hopefully it will fade w/time.</li>
            <li> They came on time and seem to be great quality with lots of different brushes. I like the carrying case too.</li>
            <li> Quite honestly, these brushes aren&#x27;t awful. The reviews I were concerned about, held no truth for me. My brushes don&#x27;t shed. They work well for their general purpose. For the price of these brushes I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Very high quality, good value</li>
            <li> These are really good brushes. They don&#x27;t shed. The roll keeps them nice and neat. I recommend them and would buy them again.</li>
            <li> i wish it had more small brushes then having three big ones but i love it grate for starting a brush collecting and a really nice set and bag for the price</li>
            <li> I  went through many reviews to find good brushes that wouldn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg and had minimal shedding. Well, I managed to find these brushes and so far so good. I had previously purchased ELF brushes but the were shedding like crazy. So far These brushes are working fine and I have had minimal shedding. The reason I didn&#x27;t give these brushes five stars is because the brushes doesnt have a label naming the kind of brush the customer is using. Other than that, I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> So glad I went with these brushes after reading all the reviews! I can&#x27;t believe how inexpensive they are and how flawless they make my makeup look. I use all Bare Minerals make up products and the brushes pick up the powders no problem with perfect application. You can&#x27;t beat the deal for the quality!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just getting into really doing my makeup and these brushes are great so far.</li>
            <li> Very soft!  Just what you need for your everyday and not-so-everyday nights out.  Great value too.  However the bag looks a bit cheap, that&#x27;s why I am only putting 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes for my teenage daughter&#x27;s birthday. I was a little nervous about ordering them online but was so pleased once she received them! They work great, came in an awesome foldable case, and better quality than I expected! She has gotten many compliments from her friends. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I really only bought these for two specific brushes but all of them are great.</li>
            <li> Got these for a great price. I occasionally get some of the bristles falling out from the big brush but it&#x27;s nothing extreme. They&#x27;re soft and they get the job done well.</li>
            <li> the brushes and make-up kit was a hit.  Just the perfect gift for my granddaughter.  She loved it.  we rated it a 5 star</li>
            <li> Excellent for the price. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing! They did the job decent. These brushes are great for beginners and the price is pretty good. They&#x27;re extremely soft. I will recommend washing them before using, only because they have a scent, but that&#x27;s normal.    Update: 10/15/14   I don&#x27;t really pick up these brushes as much as I would like. The only ones I seem to pick up is the bronzer brush. The brushes feel soft but they don&#x27;t pick up much product and they don&#x27;t put much product on your face. Like I said these are good beginner makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> These are awesome brushes.  They are sodt and have not fallen apart.  Also, they were cheap.</li>
            <li> Good quality set. The bristles don&#x27;t shed and they maintain their shape after cleaning (using cleanser for natural bristles). The case in which they come is handy, durable and portable. Looks just like the picture. The handles of the brushes are long; about 6 or 7 inches. Over-all great purchase, however the case does smell a bit like paint.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes for a friend for Christmas because I was tired of using her sponge aplicators every time she asked me to do her her makeup.  They are great brushes for the price! The bristles are soft, the case is handy and it has plenty of brushes to choose from. The handles are a bit longer than I like them, but maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m used to my own brushes. I would definetly recommend these brushes for any beginner.</li>
            <li> The foundation brush sheds  A LOT. The other brushes are fantastic. I love the carrying case and how light weight the brushes are.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my daughter-in-law and she loves them.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes ! These wash well I use shampoo on them and they also apply nicely and smoothly ...</li>
            <li> I bought these for my sister for Christmas and she&#x27;s pretty picky about brushes. She says they&#x27;re great and smooth on her skin and hold up really well!</li>
            <li> Very Niceeeee! Thanks u!</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes, they are super soft and I really enjoy them.</li>
            <li> Awesome awesome set of makeup brushes!!! The only thing I would say needs to change is the smell of plastic. But other than that, amazing quality!</li>
            <li> really good quality and I love the variety or shapes and sizes.</li>
            <li> My daughter is enjoying her brush set, although they do shed sometimes.</li>
            <li> these brushes blend good when half of their hair isnt falling off! I woud not recommend these to anybody as I am repeatedly picking the loose hair from the brushes off my face! it is very annoying &amp; I get so frustrated. You get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> Very happy with the quality of these brushes.  The natural brush heads are soft and sensitive on the skin. Very good selection of different sizes and shapes.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy these brushes. Economical and great quality.</li>
            <li> The brushes are working wonderfully.  I&#x27;ve washed them twice and don&#x27;t have issues with shedding.  This is my first time using professional brushes.  I bought these because the price and reviews were good.  I&#x27;d just purchased Bobbi Brown make up, and the brush for the eyeliner, alone, cost $25 from that line.  This is much more economical, and it works.  The make-up artist at Nordstrom had recommended a brush with a name that began with &amp;#34;K,&amp;#34; but he couldn&#x27;t think of the name.  I bet it&#x27;s this one.</li>
            <li> These were a Christmas gift for my grandaughter - she is very pleased with the quality and variety of these brushes.</li>
            <li> Good news: Shipping was super fast and the brushes themselves appear to be excellent. Bad news:  the smell, once the outer packaging was removed, was horrific.  It was like there was a fuel spill in my house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have cleaned the brushes and storage container twice now, and it&#x27;s starting to improve. Will have to air them outside for another day before storing in my house though.  The gasses they were giving off on arrival was absolutely unreasonable, but it&#x27;s slowly improving.</li>
            <li> These are good brushes for their price</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I haven&#x27;t been using professional brushes sooner.  It&#x27;s so much better to apply make up and blending.  I love these soft brushes and recommend them to everyone.  One thing I wish they would have included tips on how to use them properly.  I found tips on utube.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great, glad I got them</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my teenage daughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Better than any i ever used. easy to clean and super soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not big on makeup, but had a few events lined up last month, so decided to give it a try. Since I&#x27;m a beginner and far from being a pro, I decided to start with those brushes. Been using them for a few weeks now and absolutely love them! Yes, sometimes a hair will come out here and there if I pull/clean too hard, but I&#x27;ve had a few encounters with REALLY bad ones before, and these are so much better! I also love the case! Makes the carrying and storage so much easier.&lt;br /&gt;In short, these are not high-end brushes, but for the price, they are just great.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite that I purchased on amazon.</li>
            <li> The brushes are wonderful! They don&#x27;t fall apart when you use them. The bristles stay in the brush and are gentle to use. Very nice quality for a very good price.</li>
            <li> I honestly ordered these on accident- but I&#x27;m glad I did!  They are great brushes for the money.  I use them daily now, and can&#x27;t understand how I lived without them!</li>
            <li> First, let me say...these are lovely, quality, real hair brushes. Soft against your skin, well made. it folds up easily and needs minimal storage. Great price and received product timely too.</li>
            <li> The quality of brushes is good, I love it..!!</li>
            <li> Very amazing quality for the low price. Such a steal. I do my makeup often and these are great. No complaints</li>
            <li> Just got my Brushes!&lt;br /&gt;They look and feel great. I love the pouch.&lt;br /&gt;Great Value for this.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great for the price. No shedding so far, bristles are soft. The brushes smelled a little funny but let them sit out and they were great!</li>
            <li> I thought these were going to be cheap....they are net......very happy with these brushes.</li>
            <li> it is great and came on time</li>
            <li> Brushes were ok, they were bought as a gift so cannot comment on the use. Great deal for the price &amp; love the sleeve they came in.</li>
            <li> I have been using these brushes for the past few weeks and they seem to be pretty high quality.</li>
            <li> Love these!  Gread quality for a great price!</li>
            <li> Awesome price for this product. You get so many brushes and they are great quality.</li>
            <li> I like the brushes. Not expensive and they give a peofessional look.</li>
            <li> A gift, so yet to be opened, but expedient delivery, good price, and appears to be what we asked for.</li>
            <li> A very good value. Pretty brushes.  They came pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice however I would have given it a great review if they had come with instructions on what each brush is for.  Even a &amp;#34;description&amp;#34; at each brush slot would have been helpful.  I know only a few obvious ones:(. This is a waste to me.  (To tell a costumer to go on line to get instructions is not acceptable)</li>
            <li> I bought two as gifts for my mom and my sister. Both said they loved the set and even got rid of their old brushes so I assume they&#x27;re good. I read reviews before purchase so I knew they&#x27;d smell. I opened the pouches and let them air out for a week or two before wrapping them. Based on feedback I got I would recommend these :)</li>
            <li> The brushes arrived on time and were as advertised. They were a gift for Christmas so I don&#x27;t know about the quality.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my order.</li>
            <li> Pretty good brushes, they do what theyre supposed to. Some loose hairs came out the first couple times I used them, but it was no big offense.</li>
            <li> Excellent value! These brushes are soft on the skin and make applying makeup pleasurable.</li>
            <li> Cant complain about it. Came as described for a good price and the brushes are nice</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush set to replace an older one, my previous set had much softer bristled brushes. These brushes are just &amp;#34;Okay&amp;#34; But they often &amp;#34;shed&amp;#34; or pieces of the bristles break off while applying my foundation, they work fine, but I would not purchase these again.  Also they have an overwhelming chemical smell when you first open the bag, not sure if its the bag or the brushes, but either way... Its powerful in a not so good way.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying the brush set that I ordered. They work very well, they hold the makeup and they do not shed. I would def recommend them!</li>
            <li> They look great. The only minor con is the length of the brushes past 7 in, which is not good when using bathroom mirror up close for detail work.</li>
            <li> I love them.. They are good quality for the price. Now i dont necesarily use all of the brushes but the ones i do use are great and, just like the description says, soft and silky.</li>
            <li> This is legitimately great! I am not great at makeup by any means, but i know that some brushes just don&#x27;t work. This works. And it feels so nice on my skin too! There is a bursh for everything. the only thing i don&#x27;t like about it is how long the brushes are. they are kinda long and if you get too close to the mirror, it kinda gets in the way...but that can be a non-issue</li>
            <li> I was offered thes Professional Studio Make-up Brushes from Karity Cosmetics for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it. They arrived and there are 12 different brushes including a brow brush. I love the black and white handles. Too bad I&#x27;m not a professional make-up artist because there are some brushes that I have no idea what to use for..lol. If you are looking for a great Make-Up Brush Set, I recommend trying this one from Karity Cosmetics.</li>
            <li> So far so good. The brushes are really soft. I only wish it came with more eyeshadow blending brushes...but I really like it.</li>
            <li> Brushes are nice, but I wish they were labeled as to each brushes specific function.  I have no idea how to use half of them.</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes for a fantastic price.</li>
            <li> Really good brushes for a reasonable price!! Definitely would recommend</li>
            <li> Great for the price. Brush fiber are a little on the stiffer side though.</li>
            <li> These brushes seem like they are good quality and packaged well.  I have only used a few so far but none of the fibers have come loose and the coverage is fantastic.  A very good buy.</li>
            <li> Great deal. Pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li> The brushes were perfect for what I needed them for</li>
            <li> Bought these as a Christmas present for my wife she loves these brushes good quality and she tells me all the time how happy she is with this brush set!!!</li>
            <li> Soft brushes excellent quality.</li>
            <li> nice brushes.  case is convenient to have but very stinky plastic. needs to be thoroughly aired out before using. brushes are still a good value without case.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like them.  The bristles come out and you have to pick them off your face.</li>
            <li> Great brush set for a great price!</li>
            <li> She uses it daily.  Makes such a big difference when she has all the tools needed.  Price is awesome compared to competitors.  Considering she buys her make-up from Nordstroms..</li>
            <li> The brushes were surprisingly decent for the price. The only issue I had was the smell, but all I&#x27;ll need to do is wash them once before use, so that really isn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
            <li> I really like the brushes, and you can&#x27;t beat the price. It has everything you will need, especially if you are just starting out as I am. However, I will say that the brushes and the pouch has a very strong chemical smell as others have stated. It was overpowering. I simply threw away the pouch since I had bought a nice makeup holder anyway. I then washed the brushes to get rid of the smell (be careful to wash them properly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been using them long so I can&#x27;t say much as to how they stand up over time. However, my first impression is that they were worth the price and I am happy for a starter set.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing!...they are really good quality and they are soft. I would recommend these brushes to family and friends.</li>
            <li> Amazing brushes, I enjoy make up and these brushes work great. Would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase!!!</li>
            <li> Nice brushes at a great price!!!!!!!  Thanks</li>
            <li> These brushes are good! I read the reviews and simeof ten were bad so I had to see for myself! They were perfect for my make up! I love them  and continue to use them!</li>
            <li> Like this brush set and would buy more</li>
            <li> love these brushes and they smell great</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.  Great product for a great price! I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> These are professional quality affordable make up brushes that are an alternative to some of the high-end brands. Although, I&#x27;ve not had a chance to test them for long, they appear to be a great investment for anyone was trying to expand their brush collection or travel a lot. The packaging was professional and the overall presentation was excellent. I would like to add two thumbs up for fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Purchased this set a few weeks ago. I&#x27;m please with the brushes and the price was even better. Good quality, nice sized brushes overall...the pouch isn&#x27;t leather as advertised the only flaw.</li>
            <li> This set was the fifth brand I tried. I think I&#x27;ve finally found a winner- they haven&#x27;t shedded, they blend nicely, and they&#x27;re a good quality overall (so far)!</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase on Amazon and I&#x27;m highly satisfied with these brushes I received. They arrived earlier than I thought, they are truly high quality, and the packaging was professional as well. These brushes pick up product very well, are soft but firm, the ends are not plastic and long, and they come with bristle protectors. The leather pouch with it is so darn cute, it doesn&#x27;t have that much of an odor, to me it smells like leather. Definitely would recommend!</li>
            <li> At first, I loved this brush set. After a week or so, however, the bristles come out too frequently. I am used to higher end brushes and get very frustrated with the foundation brush. Every time I use it, I have more bristles on my face than foundation. However, the fan brush, eyebrow brush, and blush and contour brushes are excellent. The eye shadow brushes are nice as well. I am not sure why the foundation brush does this, but for $11, it&#x27;s not terrible. I will purchase a better quality foundation brush and continue to use the other brushes in the kit. Travels very easily and is nice to keep brushes organized when not in use.</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes. The bag smells funny. Just let it air out. It goes away. Good purchase overall</li>
            <li> Great set of brushes for the money ... I would highly recommend !!!!!</li>
            <li> beautiful excellent and for the price more beautiful still recommend.........</li>
            <li> Brushes are perfect, but I threw away the bag because it smelled strong ( plastic smell)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for brushes for a long time, and I saw these brushes while browsing through amazon  and boy was I glad they came across. I loved how these came with it&#x27;s little pouch because other brands don&#x27;t come with it so then you need to find something to put all those brushes in. The brushes work great, they are very good quality, and the price is a very good price! I love them! I recommend to you all.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for! Brushes are to soft to even blend anything therefore no good to use end of story.</li>
            <li> Very nice brushes! I love them!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, I love my brushes!!</li>
            <li> Pretty good quality bristle wise but the handles separate far too easily</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a make-up artist.  She loves them, very professional.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this makeup brush set 5-stars because I am taking into consideration the price I payed for them. They work no brissels fall off and I really like the eyeshadow brushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if you are looking for legit thick high grade brushes...these aren&#x27;t it and you won&#x27;t find any at this price but these will we&#x27;ll get you through every day make up and you will LOVE them! :)</li>
            <li> Awesome! Someone said the brushes had the name on it, well they didn´t but I don´t mind much. They feel great, I had Mac Brushes  for more than 7x the price and this could compare to them. :)</li>
            <li> The brushes are good quality and my daughter loves them.</li>
            <li> These are great! I really enjoy using them.  They are exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Can not beat the price for these soft, professional looking brushes!!!!  All the brushes I could want and in a beautiful, carry case!!!</li>
            <li> These brushes sounded great so I took a chance on them. Even for the low pricepoint, I am disappointed. They shed - a lot! I have not been able to do my makeup one single time without finding bristles stuck to my face! I&#x27;ve given them a few months and a few cleanings to see if it would get better, but it hasn&#x27;t. Time for better brushes.</li>
            <li> Love them, great brushes at a great price</li>
            <li> Not soft at all! Lose hair and smells. I am not picky about brushes but these ones are soooooo bad. When I use them to apply foundation, the hair is too hard and scratches my face. For the same reason, I can not use the eyeshadow brush at all. It hurts my eyelid. And since the brushes loose hair, the hair is all over my face after using them.</li>
            <li> I just received these brushes and have not even used yet - but wanted to leave a review that they definitely feel and appear worthy of the reviews that encouraged me to buy them.  I will update this after some use, but if you are on the fence, the brush holder alone is probably worth the price!</li>
            <li> I recommend this set of brushes to anyone who has been wanting a set of make-up brushes and not pay an arm and a leg for them.  It does the job.  Love it especially the price!</li>
            <li> Lo que necesitas, perfecto para usarlas todos los d&amp;iacute;as...</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it. Great value for the price.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. I only use makeup every now and then and these are very nice. Also the company was very good when I did not receive my brushes (Ihad to order them twice) they gave me a refund and I recived my second order. I really love how soft they are and mine hardly had any loose hair after washing them.</li>
            <li> I ordered these on sale, expecting them to be mediocre, but they are honestly so good. The quality is good and they last through some heavy usage.</li>
            <li> These arrived right on time (two day shipping). Immediately after opening the box I could smell a very strong chemical smell. I let them air out, along with the bag that they came in before use. After about a week the smell has dissipated some, but not completly. I think for the price point these will work fine, they are soft and made well enough. Just be aware of the smell.</li>
            <li> Good brushes for the price.  This is my first set of makeup brushes and they seem to be good quality.  I&#x27;ve only been using for a few weeks so it&#x27;s hard to say how long they&#x27;ll last.</li>
            <li> Shipped right away and with everything stated in description. Works great!</li>
            <li> They work, and it is a neat little kit of brushes.</li>
            <li> As a former Lancôme makeup artist, I love these brushes!!! Excellent quality and you can&#x27;t beat the price. Everything you need is in this set!</li>
            <li> The brushes are great quality. Its MAGNIFICENT. They are soft and the delivery was the best part. Super duper fast!! And i&#x27;ve read the other reviews saying that ut smells like chemicals but it doesn&#x27;t they smell like how brushes smell like. The price is great! I love love LOVE 💕. I think i might buy another set for my mom !</li>
            <li> It is okay. Good condition.</li>
            <li> I use these every single day. They are super awesome! Im glad they are each covered. That way i can keep them clean. I love each and every brush. No complaints at all.</li>
            <li> Great brushes. They are soft and put the makeup on evenly. Great price and great product.</li>
            <li> yesss i finally got 12 piece of make up brush this is what exactly i needed for daily use&lt;br /&gt;i been using this since the day its arrive from my orders,&lt;br /&gt;this brush its make me so happy i have everything that i need&lt;br /&gt;they are very soft,&lt;br /&gt;the quality its very nice&lt;br /&gt;i can recommend it all my friends whose using make ups ,&lt;br /&gt;its 100% satisfaction guarantee,some brush that i have been use its make me itch,but this one is really make me feel so comptable.&lt;br /&gt;and most important thing is this brush is make me smile and happy :)</li>
            <li> Ordered on Tuesday, received on Thursday :) Beautiful brushes!</li>
            <li> i loooooove it ! so much !!! i thought i may regret order this brushs but when i see it i was in shock cuz i like the quilty and i give it for one of my friends and she go crazy because of it.. i may order it over and over &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Great makeup brushes!!! Arrived very quickly. Love them!</li>
            <li> Nice brush kit in handy little wrap type case. Great for traveling. Would definitely buy them again and recommend them to anyone looking for them. Please note these were bought for personal use not for professional use.</li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews, they smell so bad....I thought it would go away, but it&#x27;s strong!!, awful</li>
            <li> just as described and shipped super fast thank you..</li>
            <li> So far very happy with this product.  The brushes seem to be good quality.  would have been nice to have a foundation brush in the set.</li>
            <li> The brushes seem find, but the plastic case they came in smelled so bad that I had to throw it away and put the brushes in something else.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE These brushes. I was very skeptical about ordering brushes online being that you can&#x27;t see what your paying for and the fact the most recent reviews were horrible about this product . I ordered this sunday today is now Wednesday I love the fast shipping! The brushes are SO soft and don&#x27;t have a smell really, as far as the packaging and the pouch there was bubble wrap and I didn&#x27;t expect the pouch to be leather. How can you pay 13$ for a leather pouch with brushes😒. I&#x27;m happy I didn&#x27;t listen to those negative reviews because I wouldn&#x27;t have brought these wonderful brushes!!! You can&#x27;t go wrong with good quality brushes for the low😝😁</li>
            <li> I actually haven&#x27;t used all the brushes yet but I have used to angled and blending brush and I like them a lot.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes.  Great quality</li>
            <li> Very soft brushes in a nice case. They came quickly. I gave as a gift to a friend and she was so happy.</li>
            <li> The brushes were very well made and presented in the case with a professional look. They seem to have a nice tight hold on the bristles themselves. My Fiancé said that they are very nice and spread makup very well for the price. Trust me she has had many high end makup brushes. I can think of some brushes she has that are almost 25.00 dollars a piece. If she says they are good and easy to use and load makeup into, they are good. I would recommend them to any guy who is buying a gift for a girlfriend, wife or fiancé.</li>
            <li> This is a nice set at a good price .</li>
            <li> Bought these because of the good reviews and the few that said the names of the brushes were on the handles...well the brushes are fine but the handles are not labeled :( I&#x27;m a bit disappointed and considering sending them back...not sure yet.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my purchase.  Brushes are soft and they work well!</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Omg I love these the best brushes for the best price ever</li>
            <li> I am not one to write reviews but I must say these are the worst set of brushes I have ever tried. I bought them because of the great reviews but boy am I returning these! First, the case is so unbelievably cheap looking. The brushes are so cheaply made. The smell is completely like plastic.  Just terrible! You get what you pay for. This is my personal opinion.You might buy these and think it&#x27;s the best set ever. I just don&#x27;t think so!</li>
            <li> Very nice brushes at a great price.</li>
            <li> These brushes are wonderful and so inexpensive.  I am sure my nieces will enjoy them for X-mas.</li>
            <li> Bought these brushes for Christmas presents so don&#x27;t know how good they are but giving them five stars for the price I paid for them.  If these are studio quality as they claim, then they were quite a bargain.  The case they come in is nice and they look like good brushes.</li>
            <li> It is a gift so don&#x27;t know how they are.  I was very pleased with the time in receiving them and also the look of them.  Thanks</li>
            <li> These brushes would be good if they were fuller and didnt shed so much.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and a great product, you will not be disappointed! However, the only thing I could say is it has that weird leather smell. The case it comes in. other than that minor flaw its the best brush set I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Only best recommendations;-)</li>
            <li> Great for people who like to experiment with makeup like me&lt;br /&gt;there is a very strong odor at first when opened but it will air out ...highly recommended</li>
            <li> These were purchased as a gift .. I was told the eye brushes were decent but the bigger brushes were cheap. The bristles get all over your face when used..</li>
            <li> Great Product!! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> There ok but I fell like the quality it&#x27;s that great over all gets the job done</li>
            <li> The brushes work very well. I gave them to my 16 yr old daughter and she is very pleased. The only issue I had was the bag they are stored in had a very strong plastic/chemical smell when we opened it. The smell has dissipated and is fine now.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very cheap and are not of quality.  I am not sure why so many people are raving about them.  The one&#x27;s I bought at target are better than these.</li>
            <li> The bag is plastic not leather.  The product is made in China and it does look cheap.  I bought it based on the good reviews and really regret it when I received the product since there is strong smell that really made me dizzy and wanted to throw up.  I really have the concern what chemical they used it here with such a smell and really believe that can be harmful to the health.  I WILL NOT recommend for anyone to get the product.</li>
            <li> The brushes are not soft. They don&#x27;t shed a lot, but if you would like to exfoliate and apply make up at the same time..buy it! Great price though.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the reminder on feedback..i get so busy. The brush kit looks great and I will be excited to try it out this week as I have a busy week that will need lots of &amp;#34;glam&amp;#34;. Bravo!</li>
            <li> These brushes are great for the price. Some of the hairs may shed but that&#x27;s to be expected. I really like the fan brush and the blush brushes. I didn&#x27;t give them five stars because the powder brush is stiff and shed likes crazy.</li>
            <li> Nice set of brushes. Clean up well, and not too expensive.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, easy to use and good quality for the price. Really pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with these brushes.  I like the variety and quality, the professional look and feel of these.  I put mine in a pretty glass container and threw away the bag.  The bag was nice and soft, but I have no need.  For the price its silly NOT to get them!</li>
            <li> Im very happy with this set was definitely money well spent</li>
            <li> I was looking for a variety of makeup brushes, but didn&#x27;t want to pay the high prices.  This set of brushes was just perfect for my needs.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes!! Best investment yet!</li>
            <li> I loved this product! Such a great price and my brushes are soft and amazing. Definitely recommend this product for anyone looking for affordable brushes that work!</li>
            <li> First of all, these really do smell quite strong so I aired them out in my living room before using. Some brushes are good, others not so much. The large powder brush is very harsh on my skin. I actually threw it away. The eyeshadow blending brush keeps shedding and the thin eyeliner brush is useless. I do like the concealer brush, and a couple of the other medium brushes. Not ready to give up my super soft mac kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for my best friend, and she absolutely loves them! She ran off after opening it to try out the brushes. Her plan was to share with her sister, but she decided they were too good to share.</li>
            <li> The only reason i gave 4 &amp; not 5 stars is because it takes several days to air this set of brushes out to eliminate or at least minizine the odor of paint. I have a screened-in backyard deck so I left the package open and on a table for several days so the smell of paint would dissipate. Otherwise, the brushes are wonderful!</li>
            <li> I have been using these brushes for about three weeks now and have already found a few issues: 1. There is a problem with the odor. It&#x27;s very strong at first and made me feel like I was in an auto body shop. Luckily, I had a pleasant scented brush cleaner that covered up the smell after a while. 2. The bristles are already falling out. After using the foundation brush three times I noticed that I was left with little hair bristles on my face. Now, the bristles fall out all the time so I can tell I will not be using this very long..&lt;br /&gt;Overall it was a good set but I expected a higher quality. It is all natural but the brushes don&#x27;t last long. Hope this helped!</li>
            <li> LOVE these! They pick up a good amount of product so you don&#x27;t constantly have to be redipping your brush. They feel good and look good. I was able to purchase this set as a back up set but now I&#x27;m finding myself using it even more.</li>
            <li> Great brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> The brushes seem okay, but there was an incredibly strong chemical smell when i opened the package. I had to hang the set outside for a full 24 hours to air it out before use.</li>
            <li> Not a bad set for the price but after a month or so of use, my brush started losing bristles. Since it comes with so many, I&#x27;ll just start using another brush, but if you&#x27;re a makeup pro, you might want to spend a little more for higher quality.</li>
            <li> I consider myself to be a makeup junkie and I ordered myself a set given the reasonable price. I could not believe the quality. These are awesome brushes! They do not shed when using and are super soft. The case is also very nice. I turned around and bought 5 more of them and gave as Christmas presents who were then loved by all. Great for an amateur makeup artist or a professional!</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my daughter and she absolutely loves them. She states that she loves the way the brushes holds the powder makeup and how smoothly the makeup goes on.  She feels like she is getting a professional makeup application each time she uses them.</li>
            <li> So far so good definitely great price</li>
            <li> These are nice - great brushes, they roll up and you can take anywhere.  I use them every day!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Very nice set of brushes. Better then expected when I opened the box.</li>
            <li> Love it although it does carry an intense smell but other then that its pretty awesome</li>
            <li> I gave a set to two of my co-workers for Christmas.  They loved them so much I got a set for myself!  The quality is excellent and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> I didnt like these brushes. Most of the eyeshadow ones are hard to use and they leave a log of hair while using them. I was super exited for them but nahh..</li>
            <li> Perfect and so cheap!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to beat a 12-piece brush set for this price. There was a plastic-like smell on the brush, but I realized it was probably from the plastic packaging. A quick wash got rid of the smell! Fast shipping too! An overall great experience!</li>
            <li> The bigger brushes are stiff and hard. Only used the smaller ones.</li>
            <li> These are a great quality product and a great price!</li>
            <li> Bought for my niece who is an aspiring professional makeup artist and she loved the quality</li>
            <li> Loved these brushes ---</li>
            <li> These brushes are cheap. Of course you get what you pay for. I had just started working with brushes or was more of a novice.  Thus, made the blunder of buying these cheap brushes. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this at all. They started shedding from the beginning, thought it might die down, but nahhh still keep shedding everywhere, on the face, while washing, even while just laying in the container. If you wanna buy something less expensive but better quality, go for Elf brushes especially their studio line which are $3 each. At least those won&#x27;t shed as much and are much much much much more softer than the course finish of these brushes. And if you can spend some more, real techniques are the holy grail. Not as pricey but amazing quality and they won&#x27;t shed on you. A good investment for few years at least. All in all, these are s***y brushes, not even worth playing with the dolls. They are going right in the garbage for I am past the return deadline. Utter waste.    Wish they had 0 star option. Amazon should really invest in it considering some of the products they endorse.</li>
            <li> I love them. Very good quality.</li>
            <li> These brushes should cost three times as much.  They are professional quality and im very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t begun to use the brushes yet, but it was frustrating to not receive any instructions in the case like other reviews said they received. All I got was card that said &amp;#34;To learn about the function of each brush, log onto Karitycosmetics.com/welcome&amp;#34;. And when I went to their website, there is nothing on there explaining the function of the brushes.</li>
            <li> Very nice set, quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I really like them. They have excellent quality.</li>
            <li> I loved this product! Good product for the price! I don&#x27;t lose bristles, and the brushes are super soft!</li>
            <li> Great price, great brush set..</li>
            <li> The brush part is great. The handles however are not. They need to be regular on almost all of them</li>
            <li> It brings a brush for everything. It&#x27;s perfect. And the quality of the brushes is very nice as well.</li>
            <li> I like them all. Relatively to the price, I got a good quality set of brushes.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes so it makes me really sad that I&#x27;m having a lot of trouble with the hair falling out of the brushes and getting stuck to my face.. The stippling brush is nearly impossible to use without a couple of hairs coming out :/</li>
            <li> Ordered these a year or two ago for my self and they work gr8 just ordered these for my mom she has very sensitive skin but I know they will work well for her too...</li>
            <li> These brushes are great! Great quality, nice wood handles. Great buy!</li>
            <li> For the price these exceed my expectations.</li>
            <li> Received very fast even during the busy holiday season. Love the case and the natural hair brushes are super soft!!!!</li>
            <li> I personally did not like these brushes because they shed every time I use them and thought these where a waste of 14 dollars. My hand for my foundation works better than these brushes do!</li>
            <li> I like the fact that the brushes grab the power really well. Only one hair came out the brush so thats good in my book.</li>
            <li> The product was good for the price.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes!!! Such a great deal!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so convenient I feel like taking it everywhere, the brushes are soft and all as described! Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> They work good and there was a wide variety of brushes to use</li>
            <li> Great for the price.  Bought for my college age granddaughter.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes for my teenage daughter and loved them so I bought myself a set!</li>
            <li> These brushes are about as good as you can get without spending a professional quality price. The case is leather(esque) and the brushes have solid handles and bristles. I would have liked a more firm powder brush, but for this price I&#x27;m certainly not complaining. Have recommended to friends.</li>
            <li> My brushes came very quickly! I washed the brushes before using, just as other reviewers suggested. The large powder brush lost quite a few bristles, but not so many that I&#x27;m concerned. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with them. They came with a card suggesting that I log onto their website to find out how to use each brush. I attempted to, but the site provided no such information.</li>
            <li> As advertised very happy with them</li>
            <li> Bought these for my daughter.  She LOVES them!  Very soft.  No hairs all over your face when you&#x27;re done.  Nice quality set of brushes!</li>
            <li> Love them! I have had many and these are great and very well priced.</li>
            <li> Love them! They&#x27;re super soft and work really well! Can&#x27;t beat the price, either. The bag does have a smell when you first get it, like some other reviews have stated...almost like wet paint. It goes away after a few days, but it&#x27;s pretty strong when you first get them! It doesn&#x27;t affect the brushes...just strange. :)</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for my daughter, she really likes them.</li>
            <li> Great quality and sizes for price</li>
            <li> What a wonderful set at a wonderful value. Very pleased with this set for the price.</li>
            <li> These brushes seem to be pretty decent quality The only thing I will agree with several other customers. The package has a distinctive odor I&#x27;m assuming from the factory. I would advise washing several times before using.</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t pick up powders very well especially if you want to use them to apply blush or bronzer</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with these brushes.</li>
            <li> Wife really loves these and was amazed at the price Well done Amazon!</li>
            <li> I use these as a professional for weddings and every day use.</li>
            <li> Loved loved loved the brushes!</li>
            <li> I am not make up artist but great set of tools to have.  I self teach my self from youtube tutorials so this kit really comes in handy to so more polished looks then with tools that may come with purchase make up.</li>
            <li> So far I love the brushes. I had to get past the factory gasoliney smell of the fake leather bag, but that wasn&#x27;t too big of a deal. I am concerned these will fray but so far all is good.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. So soft and do not shed. They are professional and all my friends thought I must have paid a fortune for them! They are better then Mac and other big name brushes! Love!</li>
            <li> I just got these today! Let me just say I had a blast applying my make up! Love the style and quality of these brushes! Got these through amzreview trader!</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes! I am very impressed!</li>
            <li> My daughter likes them so much she bought them for her friend!</li>
            <li> I have not had the opportunity to use the brushes, but the quality appears subpar.</li>
            <li> Sturdy brushes and holder, but they do she&#x27;s quite a lot with heavy use.</li>
            <li> Great Make Up Brush Set!  Got this for my daughter and she loves it!  There&#x27;s a brush for absolutely everything!</li>
            <li> I really like the brushes, my make up apply much better, the brushes does not shed, which is the most important.</li>
            <li> Have just used them a few times.  Feels very nice on my face.  Wish the brushes would have come with detail on what they are for.</li>
            <li> Recommended good quality</li>
            <li> Product came in very quickly, great quality brushes for such an affordable price.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my wife for Christmas and she loves them.</li>
            <li> This kit is suitable for any kind of make up.</li>
            <li> Nice variety is sizes and shapes. Great quality.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes.  They are soft and good quality.  The only issue is some shedding on my face but it&#x27;s not excessive.  I would recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my adult daughter and she said she loved them. I liked the case they came in and the price!</li>
            <li> I love this set very nice and durable, no bad smell. Only thing is you can&#x27;t use it with liquid foundation it sheds off and sticks to your face but it works fine with powders, I would buy again</li>
            <li> I bought these for my BFF for Christmas.  She was amazed at how nice they were.  Great price for a great product!</li>
            <li> The small brushes worked well, but there was lots of shedding on my face with the larger brushes</li>
            <li> This set of brushes is wonderful. The case has a flap that protects the brushes so it is easy to store and take them on the go without the worry that&lt;br /&gt;the will get dirty. The brushes themselves are soft and apply great.</li>
            <li> Not bad for this price. Good!!</li>
            <li> I received the brushes sooner than expected. I was pretty impressed with the quality of the brushes. The set comes with a variety of brushes, which is awesome. I would definitely order again from here.</li>
            <li> Great quality!!! My girlfriend loved them! Definately worth it, will buy again to gift :)</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft! I love them especially for the price.</li>
            <li> My grand daughter is active in all her community plays so she is into stage makeup.  After reading the favorable reviews, I decided to purchase them for her.  Makeup brushes were a request and she loved how many came in the case.  I saw her looking at them over and over. .</li>
            <li> These brushes are AWESOME!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I was a little worried to buy them from the cheap price but Im glad I did!!&lt;br /&gt;The leather from the brush holder is high quality, you can just tell.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are so soft but firm enough to get the makeup on your face too. My favorite is the small angled brush, I use it for concealer under by brows, its great!!&lt;br /&gt;The brushes blend well, and dont dust away my blush or powders when I use them.&lt;br /&gt;All in all Im very happy!!&lt;br /&gt;One thing though, (Just because Im very picky), maybe have more color selections to choose from other than black? Maybe like girly colors like pink, light blue or purple, you know just to name a few. That would be a big plus! But its not a big deal, just something to add for a suggestion!&lt;br /&gt;I love these brushes!!</li>
            <li> this brush set exceeded my expectations! The brushes are really soft and work wonderfully. The only bad thing is that the hair falls out frequently. I would reccomend it to anyone! Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!  There is a great variety.  They are very soft and they do a great job with application.  My eyeshadow especially looks much smoother and even then before.  I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> These are really nice. Got them as a gift for my daughters friend. She loved them. They are nice quality for the price. I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price.  Bought for my girls for Christmas and they were thrilled.</li>
            <li> Great product says my wife!</li>
            <li> Purchased these for my daughter as a Christmas gift.  She loves them.  The case is very well made, packs easily and the brushes are excellent quality.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> This set of brushes would have been okay for the price if the brushes didn&#x27;t have such an odor - the odor had petroleum based  smell which may have been from the case - but even after washing the brushes retained that odor and made me unwilling to use them on my face. I ordered them mainly for the smaller brushes to use with eye shadows and for blending since I prefer synthetic for foundation, but in this case I found the natural hairs to be of a lesser quality than expected - course and wild! Not what I hoped for. Returned product.</li>
            <li> I give it five star, brushes came as the look on the picture. They do have a smell to it but after letting it air out the smell went away. A other that I like them ! Work great w my makeup !!</li>
            <li> Great brush!! Good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Very nice, I have many make-up brushes, bought these while visiting my daughter. They are some of the best brushes I own.  In my option well worth the money.</li>
            <li> For the price these seem like a great set of brushes! I just got them so need to use them awhile to see how they perform</li>
            <li> Wonderful brush set. Such a super price too. The brushes are natural and very soft. High quality for very reasonable price. I love the folding case it comes with--let&#x27;s you store the brushes safely and will travel well too. Thank you for offering a great product!</li>
            <li> Eu gostei do produto. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I bought these for both of my daughters for Christmas. They love them and they are very good quality for the price:) I may be getting a set for myself soon!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product been using for the past week now. I really love the qualoyy of the brushes they are also very long so you get an extra grip. Only took 3 days to arrive!</li>
            <li> These brushes are great! I only have a problem with the fan brush. The bristles were kind of everywhere when I got it. Also on the lip lining brush, you can tell it&#x27;s going to fray pretty easily. Other than that all of the brushes are great! The powder brush puts just enough powder without being cakey. The eyeshadow brushes actually make my eyeshadow more pigmented, which is great. And the price was fantastic!! $14 compared to $85 on Karity&#x27;s website was great. These are definitely not $85 brushes, but will last you a while!</li>
            <li> Beautiful set of quality brushes. I retired my other brushes and put these front &amp; center on my vanity. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Great quality especially for the low price I purchased them.</li>
            <li> This was given as a gift and was very well received.  She uses them everyday and absolutely loves them.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful set of brushes.  More than I expected.  They have soft bristles and are not cheap looking.  Great price.  I would definitely recommend them to others.  You rock!</li>
            <li> I love these make up brushes. They&#x27;re descent quality and at a great price.</li>
            <li> Great brushes at low cost!  Love the contour brush. These brushes definitely make a difference.</li>
            <li> Bottom line is these are very good brushes at a very good price.</li>
            <li> very nice quality brushes ..... WIth a great price</li>
            <li> Granddaughter loved them.</li>
            <li> Not great quality. The bristles come out constantly, and they don&#x27;t provide a super even coverage. It&#x27;s about what I expected from the price though.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use these brushes yet, but I like the way they look, I like the packaging, and the brushes feel like good quality.</li>
            <li> Good qualty!! Great price!!</li>
            <li> Very good quality but it has a distinct odor I have not use it yet and have not wash yet</li>
            <li> Great brushes! They are easy to work with because they are long. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The picture does not do these brushes justice. I love every one of these professional makeup brushes! They are wonderful. Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Decent set of brushes for the price. No complaints. Minor shedding. Love the fan brush and case :) I&#x27;m fairly new to makeup but seems decent.</li>
            <li> Underwhelmed. The only rush that was useful was the fanned brush. My other professional brushes are far superior. Good set for beginners for the price, but the fibers are itchy, feel scratchy, and uncomfortable. And so many essential brush types are missing. I do love the small tapered brushes and the eyeshadow brushes.</li>
            <li> Nice set of brushes. They are holding up well. I love the case they come with too.  Great variety of brushes. All you will ever need.</li>
            <li> Great brushes! Thank you</li>
            <li> These brushes are great and soft and definitely worth the price :) I&#x27;ve used them everyday for a few weeks now and no problems so far :)</li>
            <li> I loved these brushes, the best I have ever used.  They are not plastic, they are real wood.  great buy</li>
            <li> All the hairs come out and stick all over my face when I am applying my make up with these brushes. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend them to anyone else. Not a good product!</li>
            <li> Good product for the money, they are falling apart 4 months in</li>
            <li> I am a casual make up user, and typically don&#x27;t use brushes. I got these for my wedding and have continued using them since. They give a nice application. Only negative is I&#x27;ve found the bristles come out sometimes. I love the case, it&#x27;s very convenient.</li>
            <li> I was going to rate this product 3 stars, but for the price it is a pretty good. It comes in a plastic bag to protect the brushes. It is not made of natural hair. If you are looking for something that feels soft like silk over your cheeks, keep looking. But as I said before, for the price it is pretty good. It came on time, some of the small brushes are very efficient to apply eye shadow. The lack of softness is more noticeable on the big brushes.</li>
            <li> The case wasn&#x27;t real leather. And i&#x27;m pretty sure the bristles aren&#x27;t authentic. Overall a decent set of brushes, though.</li>
            <li> Good set of makeup brushes with a serviceable case. I have only used one of them so far, but the quality looks good, and the price is excellent.</li>
            <li> vlaue for money for sure.... am glad i bought this!</li>
            <li> I bought these because they had such high reviews. I have no idea why. The bag is plastic not leather, the brushes stink and they are a cheap harsh fiber... you can just tell. If your looking for a professional grade makeup brush set this is not the set you want.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved my brushes!</li>
            <li> The handles and case are great quality.  The fan brush isn&#x27;t quite a fan.  It looks like it was smashed during shipping. The bigger brushes hairs fall out. The smaller brushes ate fine.</li>
            <li> I like these brushes and it comes with a good variety, but one of the brush heads  is loose and I&#x27;m afraid the bristles are going to fall off.  It&#x27;s only on one of them so I&#x27;m wondering if I just got a defective brush. I would be willing to try them again.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because of the price but these brushes are perfect !!! I even bought a second set to use when I travel !!!</li>
            <li> These are great quality! I was very impressed based on the price.  It has a great variety of brushes and takes care of all my makeup needs (except I do have a separate foundation brush that is made of a different material).  I am not a makeup artist, but I do like nice brushes - they make such a difference especially for eyeshadow.  I think these will last a long time!</li>
            <li> These were a Christmas present for my daughter. They are of good quality and full-sized.  My daughter was very pleased.</li>
            <li> Great set of brushes for all types of makeup. Some of the brushes, we&#x27;re not sure what they&#x27;re for, but nice quality.</li>
            <li> My brushes arrived on time and in great condition.  The brushes are of good quality and the case/bag is nice to have.  Have the variety of different brushes has taken my makeup routine to the next level.</li>
            <li> Real hair. Lovely set.</li>
            <li> I got this for my sister as a Christmas gift and she seems very happy with it. She was impressed by the wide selection of brushes. Worth the price I paid.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes and the price is great.  I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> The brushes are great. My daughter enjoys them and uses them everyday. Good buy at good price.</li>
            <li> We love the brushes definitely will buy more .</li>
            <li> Highly recommended. I bought these make-up brushes a few weeks ago. They have the kind of quality that I believe would last a while.</li>
            <li> They are a nice set but they are not as soft as I thought and they shed little hairs.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this product was the price. The I use a lot of cream based foundation so I had problems with the brushes. The bristles keep coming off the brush and stick to my face. It is very annoying. Other than that the eyeshadow brushes are effective.</li>
            <li> These brushes were a Christmas gift for my grand daughter.  She gave them 4 stars because the only thing she noticed was not all the powdered makeup came out when she dusted them off.  That caused a small amount of makeup to get mixed.  Other than that, she loves them.</li>
            <li> These brushes were everything I could have hoped for! The bristles are soft and hold the powders well. Perfect array of all the types I needed for my first full brush set!</li>
            <li> got these for gift the brushes work great feels like good quality</li>
            <li> I got my brushes a few weeks ago and use them EVERYDAY! For the price you pay, this is a WIN! They are very soft and the hair does not fall off. It&#x27;s so compact and so easy to take with you everywhere so you can touch-up if need be! The only complaint I had was the smell. It&#x27;s a very strong like alcohol type smell. I&#x27;m not really sure how to explain it. But, lay it out unraveled overnight and it will go away. This is definitely a steal that you won&#x27;t regret!</li>
            <li> Love!!! Great Quality Fast Shipping</li>
            <li> Purchased as a XMAS gift and the recipient LOVES these brushes. Great buy and great product!</li>
            <li> Easy fast and really good pricing</li>
            <li> Very good set for an unbelievable price!  arrived promptly as promised also.</li>
            <li> While I have so many reservations about purchasing &#x27;natural&#x27; brushes, I couldn&#x27;t pass up on the deal. Having said that, these brushes are lovely and cover all my needs and then some. I will treasure them always.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes for my daughter for Christmas.  She told me on 3 separate occasions that she loves them!!!!!</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift so I didn&#x27;t use it, but it looked nice and I haven&#x27;t heard anything negative about it.</li>
            <li> This makeup kit is awesome!!!  I gave it to my daughter for Christmas and she absolutely loves it!!!  It is a great buy and I would buy it again!!!</li>
            <li> Very impressed with the quality of the brushes. I purchased these for my 15 year old cousin. She loved them and was very pleased.</li>
            <li> Awesome set!! My sister told me she wanted a good quality brush set for Christmas, and the reviews just raved about this one. The only thing she told me she wished it had was labels on the brushes.  However, she found an image online that showed her which brush was which.  But so far, no problems, and she loves them!</li>
            <li> Great starter brush set! Soft; easy to clean;bristles stay put...really nice for the price..you cannot go wrong here!</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for a friend and she loved it. Now I&#x27;m slightly jealous and looking forward to buying one for myself.</li>
            <li> These are very nice! There is a brush for every need and the longer handles allow a more secure grip. I would definitely purchase these again!</li>
            <li> I LOVE these brushes. They are an awesome value.</li>
            <li> my mom loved them! however, there is an odor when they are first opened (like dry erase markers) but with a wash or two, that goes away completely. All in all, really great deal and i definitely recommend. :)</li>
            <li> Great brushes, they hav&#x27;t shed any hairs yet.  I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Great quality! Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> 5 stars on the variety/amount of brushes for the price! They work extremely well and totally make a huge difference in makeup application/appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars were given on the fact that a couple hairs from the brushes come out during makeup application with almost every use and one of the brushes&#x27; wood glue was weak and so it slid out within first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, for the price and amount of brushes, it is a good set and they do the job well.</li>
            <li> Great deal, daughter uses them every day without issues. No bristles falling out and applies her make up smoothly. Price cant be beat.</li>
            <li> The brushes weren&#x27;t very soft and the bristles fell out a little. It&#x27;s okay, for a person who has to use natural brushes it was a good buy, but, they could&#x27;a been better.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. It was a gift to my niece and it made her very happy. I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> Great brushes. Was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Nice product. I enjoy using it</li>
            <li> I bought these for my teenage daughter. She is happy with the makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> The best brushes ever. A great brush, attractive sturdy handles. .soft bristle brushes  and nice brush apron. The price was well worth it; the value was over $80 on the website fit the exact same product</li>
            <li> Girlfriend Loved the brushes,and they were packed nicely!</li>
            <li> Product was just as promised and was shipped in fine time.</li>
            <li> Pretty good product, though they shed more bristles during use than I would like.</li>
            <li> My wife has used theses brushes for a few months now and they are holding up really well. Others begin to lose hair rather quickly, but these have stood up well so far. The bag isn&#x27;t extremely large so it makes it easy to pack for trips.</li>
            <li> Well made brushes for very little money, they came very quickly. This was purchased for an aspiring makeup artist, this is her 1st set of brushes, now she has all the basic tools she needs.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my daughter.  She says they work great - and what a bargain.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes and the case it comes in.  They were wrapped nicely so that none of the bristles have been squished. None of the bristles are falling out even with daily use.  Brushes are super soft!</li>
            <li> The price is great. The foundation brush doesn&#x27;t work very well but the rest of them are fine. It does sort of smell because of the container it comes in.</li>
            <li> So happy with my purchase. These brushes surely are not the best quality, but for the price, they are WAY BETTER than I expected. I own better brushes but these are seriously a great addition to my collection. I love the case and look and they came fairly quickly!! These are a great starter set or maybe as a gift for a makeup beginner and/or enthusiast. Will definitely purchase more affordable sets from this seller in the future!! I cannot express how impressed I am by the quality/price ratio that these brushes have. I am thrilled that I came across this deal!</li>
            <li> I had Sephora brushes before and was ready for a set with a bigger variety but still real hair (which are hard to find for a good price). I really like this set. The application is great. The blend of the brushes make it as good as real hair. I wish it had an eyeliner brush with shorter bristles (I thought the one in the set could have been better). But overall it is a great set for the price. The pouch is great and easy to take and go. Definitely don&#x27;t need more brushes than this!</li>
            <li> Goid brushes, good price!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! If you&#x27;re worried about a &amp;#34;chemical smell&amp;#34; there is one... But it is very very faint and not very noticeable at all! The product came in before expected! I&#x27;m completely satisfied!</li>
            <li> Decent quality for the price, however the brushes are shedding and don&#x27;t quite look great.</li>
            <li> Awesome, great quality brushes and packaging, fast delivery, would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re alright for their price. They feel a bit prickly on my skin and they shed a bit but for the price, they do okay.</li>
            <li> These brushes feel amazing soft and they hold product very well.</li>
            <li> I was excited to order this product but once I received it the case and the brushes had a painful smell. I think they were covered in paint thinner!!! I would not recomment this product to anyone and returned it immediately.</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes! The price was unbeatable :) Will definitely look to Karity Cosmetics for beauty supplies I may need in the future!</li>
            <li> These are really great brushes they are soft and very sturdy. The case has a smell of leather which I happen to like a lot. I ordered two and gave one to my family member whom loves it. It is also makes a great gift or a good starter kit for someone who is not so experienced with make up.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift to my goddaughter.  It was nicely packaged and seemed like good quality brushes.  I think she will be happy with them.</li>
            <li> Great brushes and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s a great deal in terms of options for different brushes; was just surprised given that, that I still found myself needing 1 or 2 types that weren&#x27;t there...think it has to do more with the quality. I&#x27;m content though</li>
            <li> Good brushes especially for the price. Have been using them for 3 months now and holding up just fine.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes and you can&#x27;t beat the price. Good quality and love the bag that keeps them organized.</li>
            <li> Despite some of the negative reviews, I went ahead and purchased these brushes. As a few have stated, I noticed bristles have fallen out; but only on the large powder/kabuki brush. And not so much to hinder my application, just a nuisance if anything. I absolutely LOVE the shadow brushes, which was my main reason for purchasing this particular set. They are perfect!!</li>
            <li> nice, soft Brushes. it is nice that they are in a easy to grab carry case</li>
            <li> Really love these brushes! Great product for the money and would recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> This set is amazing. When you pull it out of the package , the case has a really strong smell. Like headache worthy smell. But after a few days the smell goes away. I have no complaints. I even bought a second one for my friend and she loves it too.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes! Doesn&#x27;t lose bristles. My makeup goes on great!!</li>
            <li> This product is such junk that I threw it out after one use. NOT GOOD.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my wife because I remember hearing her ramble on about needing better makeup brushes once or twice. I gave them to her today and told her the internet said they were good ones. She was impressed that they were very soft and well made. While she said that the carrying bag they come in was pretty generic, she didn&#x27;t really care about that. She said that she was glad that the brushes had individual sleeves inside of the carrying case to preserve their shapes. If she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy, and I must say that she looked pretty gorgeous when she left this morning.</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes at a fantastic price!  My daughter loves them!  Very durable and of excellent quality!</li>
            <li> Love my brushes.  Make-up goes on so smoothly.</li>
            <li> Smelled a lot like paint when I first got them, which I thought was weird. I washed them with my brush cleaning solution and wiped down the pouch it came in (which is nice pleather-ish material) and the smell went away. The brushes are really good quality. Soft, and none of the hairs come out. Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> Solid set with all the necessary fundamentals!</li>
            <li> Though the product is great and really cheap, don&#x27;t buy from this company because all they will do is bug you for a review, even months after it has become clear that you have no desire to.</li>
            <li> These brushes are a great base collection. It doesn&#x27;t have everything you&#x27;ll want, and the quality is better than expected for the price. It comes in a faux-leather carrying case, I passed that on to a traveler friend of mine since you&#x27;re supposed to store brushes upright. The brushes didn&#x27;t shed, they didn&#x27;t smell at all (though the case did smell a little plastic-y) and I use them often!</li>
            <li> Really great quality for such a reasonable price!!</li>
            <li> Nice set! Happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> It is simple. I love them. I use them everyday.</li>
            <li> Did not have the strong chemical smell I was worried about. I am no expert in make up brushes but these seem to be fine, did not come apart on soaking in soap water for a few hours,</li>
            <li> Received my 12 piece brushes and I LOVE them! There high quality and the brush hairs are soft but sturdy.  I actually Google the same brushes on line and on there website these bushes are much higher in price.  So not only are you getting a high quality product but your also getting a really good deal.  I&#x27;m very satisfied ,</li>
            <li> It looks good and the brushes are good quality</li>
            <li> So much better than using pads and brushes which come with my make up. Make up goes on and looks much better.</li>
            <li> Loved the brushes quality for such a great price who needs to spend $20 per brush or more these work just the same if not better. Brushes dont make the makeup artist but these brushes are superb and they get the job done. Even after washing they still remained soft and did not shed, unlike my more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> I loved these brushes. Just what I was looking for, a complete set, soft brushes that actulally do the job.</li>
            <li> I like these brushes. They work great for me and I feel like the price is legit. For those complaining about the smell, it goes away and I wouldn&#x27;t call it a deal breaker if it didn&#x27;t. Besides, it&#x27;s just the bag that smells that way, not the brushes.</li>
            <li> Love the brushes! So much better than my ELF brushes.</li>
            <li> Those brushes are super soft and good quality. Love them.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes!  Have not had any trouble with brush pieces fall out!!</li>
            <li> The fibers were not good. Didn&#x27;t pick the makeup up</li>
            <li> If your looking for some cheap brushes, these work great. Especially if your just starting to use them. Even make up artist they ship fast and work just as great as the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes. I use them every other day to put make up on before my show. They&#x27;re very good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this brush set after reading several reviews from others who were very satisfied. Upon receiving the brushes, I first noticed that they were packaged very nicely. The case is convenient and each brush comes individually wrapped with a separate plastic guard to keep the bristles from being damaged. I was pleased with the presentation. It would have been nice if each brush was labeled to indicate intended use, but that&#x27;s not a big deal and the website provides detailed explanation should anyone really need that information.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes seem to be good quality, however I do have a couple of complaints that served as the reason for my three star rating. The metal piece that holds the bristles is very loose and wobbly where it is attached to the handle of the brush. This makes holding the brushes awkward because I have to adjust my grip in order to keep the head from moving back and forth with each stroke. The only other thing is that I noticed the bigger foundation, blush, and contouring brushes shed quite significantly the first couple of times I used them. I don&#x27;t know if this will persist and I am not sure if it&#x27;s universal to the entire set (I haven&#x27;t tried the eye shadow or blending brushes yet), but that was somewhat disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, other than the complaints I had, this is a decent set for a beginner or for someone who is on a tight budget. It&#x27;s a set that I would use while saving money for a higher end set or individual brushes of better quality such as from the MAC line.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the great reviews and low price. Good quality none broke(n)  soft enough esp even if you have sensitive skin (like me) bag has kinda an overwleming smell tho but o well :) beginner</li>
            <li> Great brush set - worth it!</li>
            <li> Good quality product at an excellent price. The brushes are compact and lightweight, making them easy to use. These were gifts for my sisters, now I&#x27;ll be purchasing my own set!</li>
            <li> I received the brushes. I loved that it came with a holder for all the brushes. The brushes are lovely - very soft and definitely not cheaply made. Seemed to be high quality brushes. My only complaint would be the smell of the bag the brushes lay in smells like paint and I really wished the brushes were marked so I would know what way to use them. That would have been very helpful for someone that has never used professional brushes before.</li>
            <li> The powder brush just keeps on shedding. I&#x27;d return it if I had the time but I needed the brushes urgently so had to use them.</li>
            <li> I have not yet used these brushes. The overwhelming chemical smell prevented me from even keeping them out in the bathroom. I just now washed them carefully in a mild shampoo bath and they are drying. I can still detect a yukky odor. I may have to give them to Goodwill, because now I doubt that I can even bring myself to put makeup on with them. I am sorry I bought them. That&#x27;s what you get sometimes, when you waste your money on a bargain.</li>
            <li> As a professional photographer I look for both value and consistency in the application of makeup for models. These brushes provide both and are highly recommended. The quality of the bristles, the shape and taper are consistently good.</li>
            <li> Love my new brushes. They are soft and I absolutely love. When I first opened they smelled HORRIBLE... I washed them &amp; black crap came out.</li>
            <li> I have really liked these brushes! I would give them five stars but there are two things that prevented me from doing so. Firstly, the smell of the case is quite strong. I left the brushes open for a week and it seemed to help, but I don&#x27;t see the smell going away completely. The last thing is that for someone who didn&#x27;t know what the brushes were or how to use them, it could be a draw back for this set. But overall I feel their performance for the price is right on point! I would recommend these to a friend</li>
            <li> My daughter loved these!</li>
            <li> Brushes were nice but there was a strong smell with it. Had to send it back.</li>
            <li> I needed some really nice makeup brushes, and ordered this set so I could toss my old ones. These are such a great set! There is every size you would need for a professional looking makeup application. No loose hairs. They feel wonderful on the skin. The storage case makes packing for a trip easy. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have no complaints with these brushes.  There is a slight plastic smell, but it dissipates within a few minutes. Its nice to have such a wide array of brushes at my disposal.  Seems like something that I will enjoy for many years.</li>
            <li> i love it ..works really well</li>
            <li> They smell really bad. Took days to &amp;#34;air them out&amp;#34; so they stunk less!</li>
            <li> I would have paid this price just for the case. Great purchase</li>
            <li> Fantastic brushes. Smell at first, but that went away fast. I use them every day! LOVE THEM!</li>
            <li> I love this brush set and its so unbelievably cheap for such high quality. They are so soft its just amazing no scratchy feeling on skin just heavenly softness and the size is very nice too. My only problem is that it does have a chemical smell to it from the paint put it isn&#x27;t very strong as a matter of fact unless you come up close you can&#x27;t even smell it and it&#x27;ll probably go away over some time but other than that its amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not totally happy with the quality and size..</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive for what you get. I only use 3 of the set personally. Would be nice of there was done guidance on what the rest were for an how to use them.</li>
            <li> I love them, they work great, they don&#x27;t shed I wish I could get the 24 piece in that brand.</li>
            <li> Fair price for the quality.</li>
            <li> These seem to be VERY good quality for the price.  I am very happy!</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t my favorite brushes, but they get the job done. While they are very soft and provide smooth application, they also shed quite a bit. The brushes and bag had an overwhelmingly strong chemical/plastic smell when I first opened the package, and most of that has faded but it hasn&#x27;t gone away. Despite the few annoyances, I have to say they are decent starter brushes, and it&#x27;s hard to beat the price.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister and she loved them. Also loved the pouch they came in. Bristles were really soft.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Used a couple of times. No Bristles left on face. Good brushes for good price</li>
            <li> Love them! Really good brushes!</li>
            <li> The quality is good. The only thing that bothered me was the strong smell. I left it close to a window to get some air and after a day or two, it was fine.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical on buying because of the mixed reviews but this is really a great set.  I got the black and white set.  They do not say what each one is for which I know some are wondering. Nice quality for the price. Definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li> The brush set is very good quality.  It has every type of brush for any make up application.&lt;br /&gt;We use them to apply make up for a cheer competition and even the cheap make up goes on and stays on all day with the brush set.&lt;br /&gt;The carrying wrap bag is a plus and very convenient.</li>
            <li> I really liked the variety of brushes offered in this bag.  Once I received the bag I wasn&#x27;t disappointed at all.  It has very soft, but sturdy bristles.  I would buy again or suggest it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes; high quality and perfect!  These are exactly what I was looking for!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great quality. Super soft. Better than MAC&#x27;s. Will definitely re-purchase</li>
            <li> Comes in a pleather package, very sleek and modern!! Nice pickup and no shedding!! Would DEFINITELY recommend this!</li>
            <li> Excellent professional grade product, she loved them!</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes because my set of MAC brushes had seen better days. I figured for the price I would give them a try since my old set was pretty pricey and not in my budget right now. I&#x27;ve used them for about two months and I&#x27;m very satisfied. There has been no shedding as I&#x27;ve experienced with some brushes in the past. Application is even whether using pressed powders, mineral makeup or dusting powders/bronzers. I would only suggest discarding the carrying case which has a significant plastic smell, but if you&#x27;ll use it air it out outside for a bit.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great! They do have a strong smell when you open them for the first time, but the smell went away as soon as I washed them. The travel case is a little stinky, but it was fine after I aired it out. I love the travel case and the fact that the bigger brushes come with plastic protectors for travel. This set is fantastic for personal use. I&#x27;m not a MUA, but in my experience with brushes, these are perfect. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with shedding. And the cost! They&#x27;re a steal...</li>
            <li> Really great quality! I was pleasantly surprised. It looks very professional, and the brushes are very soft, and the handles are solid. Worth every penny, and then some!</li>
            <li> This kit is awesome I never thought my make up could look so good I&#x27;m very happy with the brushes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why these brushes have such great reviews. I ordered these for my mom, and while she likes them just fine (she&#x27;s never used make up brushes before), I found the bristles in these brushes rough on the skin, and they fall out from time to time. The powder brushes are too small. These brushes look and feel cheap. The only thing I liked is the brush holder. It&#x27;s very convenient for on the go (added an extra star for that). Other than that, I would not recommend these brushes. Amazon sells much better quality brushes for the same price.</li>
            <li> These were the first makeup brushes ihave ever purchased. I have very sensitive skin and these brushes are soft enough to not irritate my skin at all, plus it has every brush I needed and wanted. I also appreciate the case it comes in. It makes it easy to take with you anywhere, plus keeps the brushes organized. I love this kit! I highly recommend this kit to anyone</li>
            <li> Based on good reviews, I had high hopes for these brushes as an inexpensive alternative to higher end brands. The bigger brushes are okay, but the smaller eyeshadow brushes (which is what I really needed) are scratchy and pick up very little pigment. I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love theses brushes. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these brushes for about 2 weeks and so far I have no complaints. It&#x27;s a lot of brushes for the money and the brushes I have used so far (powder, blush, 2 eyeshadow, eye liner) are very soft. The case is nice and rolls up neatly. Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I considered giving 4 stars because the brushes are too long for my travel makeup bag, but since they come with their own travel case I haven&#x27;t found that to be an inconvenience. These are quality brushes that have held up very nicely for the last few months. Tip: wash them before using the first time, it will ensure you&#x27;re using a clean brush get rid of any loose hairs. I&#x27;ve noticed very little shedding since.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 of these, one for my daughter and one for me. We both agree these brushes are fantastic! Great quality and fast shipping, too.</li>
            <li> Very professional spa style brushes!!!!. Great for applying liquid as well powder foundation. Eye shadow brushes make application easy and professional looking.</li>
            <li> great product! I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again :) Im so happy with my brushes</li>
            <li> Such an awesome variety for a great price. Love the cool case they come in.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great. I love the black and white. The quality its exactly what i am looking for. The brushes are soft and don&#x27;t feel cheap and sharp like some of the other similar packages on Amazon. For the price, you get what you need, plus a better quality than expected.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife so she can use it for her new sephora makeup palatte, she said they&#x27;re soft and work perfectly, she loves them. I am so happy for buying this for her she looks happy everytime she uses them. I give 5 stars that&#x27;s what my wife said.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. They are super soft and easy to clean. When they are cleaned bristles do not fall out, a problem I&#x27;ve experienced with other brands. The brush bag that came with the kit is also great for keeping the brushes separated and keeps the bristle looking nice.</li>
            <li> great quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Great. Did have a small plastic smell but after airing out a day all&#x27;s well. Brush hairs don&#x27;t fall out and I&#x27;ve been using them for about 2 months. Not to mention their fast delivery</li>
            <li> I really love this brushes they were more than what I expected. the items were great quality items</li>
            <li> bought this set as a gift for my 15 yr old- she loves them.  quality seems great n delivery was fast n accurate. great product for the money!</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and full. Nice value.</li>
            <li> Buy them! You&#x27;ll love them. And you cannot beat the price! :)</li>
            <li> This is a nice set of makeup brushes at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Very nice brushes and stores easily</li>
            <li> Everything I wanted and needed. Since I travel a lot for work I bought 2. One for Home and 1 for the road</li>
            <li> Excelent quality and excelelent price !!!  Buy it !!!</li>
            <li> Amazing deal for high quality brushes!</li>
            <li> they are great for the price.</li>
            <li> I followed all directions and extremely disappointed.  The hair came out a lot my first couple times using them.  The brushes were kind of rough and irritating to the skin.I ended up giving the set to my 7 year old daughter to play with.</li>
            <li> I love this brushes.  I love them so much I ordered a second set.  The handles are nice and long that the brush blends the makeup nicely. Wish I had a favourite one but they all are.</li>
            <li> Gift for my daughter who requested this product and has enjoyed using the brushes.</li>
            <li> I purchased for my teenage daughter who likes them a lot. They are very nice.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my teenage niece.  The brushes are nice and soft although I thought they were a little too large.  As another reviewer noted, the case had an odor when I first opened it.  Most of it seemed to come from the plastic wrapping, so once I got rid of that it was better but not completely eliminated.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting ! Love the price and quality</li>
            <li> Love all the brushes &amp; carrying roll case. Wash brushes &amp; air out case when you first get it.</li>
            <li> I have been using these brushes for a few days and I LOVE them.  These are definitely the best quality make up brushes I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> They work really well but they do have a strong odor. I would most definitely give them a strong 5 stars if not for the smell. I&#x27;m hoping it goes away after a while.</li>
            <li> these brushes arrived on time. they came in a very nice pouch and the are very good quality. I would buy these again. I would recommend these to anyone</li>
            <li> Really really good quality  brushes....the smell of the bag is bad, but it&#x27;s not a problem to remove it</li>
            <li> Great brushes! I love the convenient of the pouch case bag, taking it anywhere with you, and all the brushes was super soft to the touch. It had a faint chemical smell but that didn&#x27;t bother me at all! I got it for my Secret Santa, and hopefully she likes it as much as I did. Planning to get a set for myself and sister because it&#x27;s cheap and all the brushes are great for all makeup uses. Fast shipping, as well. Happy shopping! :D</li>
            <li> I really like the quality of the brushes, the bristles do not flake off and makes applying my cosmetics very easy. Great deal for someone who is new to cosmetics or wants to save money on brushes. I just wished that they labeled each brush, but they do send a card with their website address so you can check online the function of each brush. Also, when I first opened the package, there was a strong &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34; smell emitting from the brush case. Luckily, it went away soon. Will purchase again in the future!</li>
            <li> Really nice brushes for the price</li>
            <li> These brushes are not of great quality, but for the price,  they&#x27;re perfect! I&#x27;m not a make up artist so they&#x27;re good for my daily make up needs, I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is a great set of brushes...great deal too.  They are sturdy, soft and good quality. I like the case they come in. The black and white color looks nice. I&#x27;d definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> A lot of good makeup brushes for a low price.</li>
            <li> item arrived on time and as described, experience was good.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes as a gift for my sister. Personally, I cannot critique these brushes as I&#x27;m not familiar with anything makeup. However, my order was shipped timely and arrived in perfect condition, which is always a plus. My sister LOVED the brushes and said they were some of the best she&#x27;s ever recieved. I would have to recommend these brushes to anyone who is looking into an affordable brush set that would also meet the expectations of any amateur or moderately experienced makeup user.</li>
            <li> Love them!! Lots of different sizes to choose from. I would highly recommend these brushes!</li>
            <li> Great quality for the price. I love the selection and the brushes are soft.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t shed at all and are really soft.</li>
            <li> Beautiful brushes even better then expected! I got some for my daughter for Christmas in white, we loved them so much I ordered me a set in pink!!! Love love very nice... :)</li>
            <li> This is an awesome brush set! I was shocked at the price and honestly did not expect it to be great but thought I&#x27;d give it a try based on some of the other reviews. I love the brushes - really high quality!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and very good quality for the price. No shedding. Second time purchasing this brand.</li>
            <li> Nice quality. I bough these for my teenage daughter for Cheistmas and she loves them.</li>
            <li> Good set of brushes, works well for what they do! After heavy use on the large brush it&#x27;s been losing some bristles, however that could just be me (I&#x27;m new at this and have just been watching YouTube videos to learn.) I would purchase this set again for myself or a friend.</li>
            <li> This brush set has been wonderful. They feel and look expensive. They hold the makeup well and aren&#x27;t falling apart after a month of use. I just wish it had a foundation brush. The case doesn&#x27;t look as expensive or nice as the brushes themselves but it is a great set especially for the price!</li>
            <li> Wife said it is great, just what she needed.thanks</li>
            <li> I got these for my daughter for Christmas and she absolutely lives them. They were a great value for the money and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Love them! I love the natural brushes. The quality is excellent and my makeup goes on much better.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a gift for my daughter.  She absolutely loves the brushes!  Very soft, great quality and they don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> These are great brushes, been using them since December and they are holding up great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad that my experience wasn&#x27;t like all the others. They fall apart whIle using them and are absolutely not soft at all. The eyelash comb was already broken, not worth your money.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes!</li>
            <li> Smells like very strong plastic. brushes are ok</li>
            <li> LOVE THESE!!  Natural hair, which I find is so much better than synthetic.  Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes for two of my granddaughters for Christmas. They had mentioned some of the more expensive brands but I purchased these because they fix my budget. They both loved them.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very soft, and I like how they&#x27;re sovkight weight. I do wish that they came with instructions on which brush is for what-I&#x27;m not exactly a professional and I really only can guess the foundation brush.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t comprehend how this product got so many good reviews...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product about 2 or 3 times, the brush hairs started shriveling up as if someone had burnt them with a lighter... Looked so disgusting and I threw everything away&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got what I paid for pretty much. Better off buying a high quality brush at sephora or Mac. At the end of the day, it is something that&#x27;s guna touch your face everyday</li>
            <li> The brushes help to apply the makeup evenly. Great price for the amount of brushes that are included in the set!</li>
            <li> Very good brush set- high quality, no odor- great purchase.</li>
            <li> Good quality, great value</li>
            <li> my sister loves it and she said she bought very expensive brushes before but this one is top quality i highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Nice quality brushes. I would order again</li>
            <li> Brushes are perfect, I just wish the case didn&#x27;t cause such a strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li> My sister loves these! The quality of the brushes itself are remarkable! Great buy!</li>
            <li> I really liked them when I first got them. I like that it came with so many brushes for all my makeup needs. But now the bigger brushes are starting to shed when I use them, so that&#x27;s why I rated it a 3. They don&#x27;t shed much, but it&#x27;s enough that it becomes a bit annoying.</li>
            <li> I bought this set for a friend for her birthday. Yeah, then I bought myself a set.</li>
            <li> Love it, a bit of a smell but they work wonders. I took the cover off each one of them and rubbed them on the palm of my hand to take the dust that makes it smell, then clean them with a wipe to take  off the excess. Loving my brushes!</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with these brushes. They are good quality. Since my skin is very sensitive, I am delighted that bristles are extremely soft. Thanks for meeting my expectations!</li>
            <li> For the price, these brushes are great.  They aren&#x27;t the Absolute best professional brushes, but they are really close..  You get so many brushes.... It&#x27;s just too good of a deal to pass up.  Im happy !</li>
            <li> Good product, great price.</li>
            <li> This is the best bang for your buck!  I&#x27;ve seen brush sets with 3 brushes similar to this quality for the same price as this entire set! I use it daily, handles are great quality and brushes are great!  Some for fine liners, contour brush, blending brush, blush brush and so much more!!!! So worth every penny!  Love the compact pouch too! Easy to put away and carry along anywhere for touch ups or travel!</li>
            <li> I love them! They did have a plastic smell when I opened them but I let them air out and the smell is gone.&lt;br /&gt;They are very soft.  I would recommend and buy again</li>
            <li> Great brushes! I bought two sets of these brushes and love them.</li>
            <li> Very nice brushes.  Glad I purchased them.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This is better than I expected! The brushes are amazing and the bag is sturdy. My only slight complaint was to do with the bag&#x27;s smell. It really smelled strongly of some chemical order. It made my tote smell for 24 hours or so. But once the smell passed, I have zero complaints :)</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice and soft. The case has a really strong smell that I hope will go away soon.</li>
            <li> Love the brush set. Was delivered on time. Brushes are exactly what i expected. So far they have not left any brush hairs on me as i am putting make up on. As long as you take care of these brushes they will last.</li>
            <li> These are excellent brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> The set is very good i have no fault with them so far not a wrong buy.</li>
            <li> I was very much looking forward to receiving these brushes, counting on the overwhelmingly positive reviews. When I received them, I could smell them before I even opened the box. I had read a few reviews about cheap makeup brushes smelling like chemicals. Well, I can tell you exactly what these smell like- spray paint. Pure spray paint.&lt;br /&gt;I opened the box because there were other items that I had ordered in it. I could not believe the fumes. I left the brushes lying on the floor after I took them out of the box and came back to them the next day. This time, I took them out of the plastic bag that they were in. I seriously felt sick just touching them, because the smell was SO STRONG. I went outside with the brush roll and opened it up to see the brushes. Everything smelled like spray paint. Like somebody had just sprayed it all- everything- with spray paint. I couldn&#x27;t handle it. I packaged them back up and sent them back for a refund immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also here to tell you all that these brushes were not soft at all. Of course I did not wash them, but I can&#x27;t imagine that washing them would change much. The smell alone was enough to deter me from touching these brushes to my face.</li>
