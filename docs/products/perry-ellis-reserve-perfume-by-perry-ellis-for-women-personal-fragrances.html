            <li>Thank you Amazon for providing this item at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>not 2 strong , nice</li>
            <li>Light enough for casual wear but perfect for work and social events.</li>
            <li>Earthy, green and refreshing.</li>

            <li> One spray goes a long way and last for hours.</li>
            <li> a LITTLE goes  a long way not to much just a little</li>
            <li> a perfume thatwould be commonly sprayed at like a JcPenny fragrance counter or what a older person would wear.</li>

            <li> If I had to say anything negative, it would be that it doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews and bought this based on what people said.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> you are looking for a fragrance with a heavy emphasis on patchouli.</li>
            <li> the fragrance has been around  a while  , very hard  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of those fragrances I don&#x27;t get tired of.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I returned it.  </li>
            <li> if all else fails it will go into the pile for unwanted items for someone to take at Christmas.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Who ever says this smells like patchouli and or woodsy is crazy.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed and can use this just about anywhere.</li>
            <li> she hated it.</li>

            <li> I had to order this perfume after smelling it on a nurse that assisted me. On her, the scent smelled clean and fresh.  The scent lifted my spirits.

            <li> I love this scent. I have been using it for years. I am not an expert on scents, so I cannot say what it smells like. But to me, its very fresh smelling. If I had to say anything negative, it would be that it doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>

            <li> It has a long lasting smell which smells great. I have been using  this for the last two years. Great product!</li>
            <li> I love the smell. This is everything I ever wanted in a fragrance. Don&#x27;t think there is anything else out there to smell any better</li>
            <li> I can almost perceive it from the website, lol. I love it on my woman as its gives me a high level of attraction. For me intimacy is best when the lady smells right and with RESERVE, no lady could ever be wrong.</li>
            <li> Smells great  Thank You</li>
            <li> Parfum fragrance selection is a very personal thing. There is nothing different or spectacular about this fragrance. It is strong. I read the other reviews and bought this based on what people said. My mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a fragrance with a heavy emphasis on patchouli. This does not fill the bill.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume!!!  It smells wonderful and lasts long!  Great packaging/shipping.</li>
            <li> thanks so much ,I wanted to surprise my wife with a different kind from what she had ,and this one did it,</li>
            <li> my mom love it,  the price, the size, all its ok.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews.. I was so excited to get this perfume. I wanted to LOVE it.. but I didn&#x27;t. I understand everyone&#x27;s tastes in scents are widely different and I wouldn&#x27;t want anyone to not order this just because of my review. I am clearly in the minority about this scent. But, I just don&#x27;t like it at all.&lt;br /&gt;I received this in the mail.. rushed to open it.. sprayed a little on and was surprised at the &#x27;sporty&#x27; and strong scent. I thought this would be a light airy scent .. but I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;The day after I received this bottle I sent it to my 26 year old daughter (my husband works with her and he brought it to her the day after I received this perfume)...the same day he bought it to her he came home with the bottle... she hated it. She said it smells like and old lady.&lt;br /&gt;I am now going to try to give this to my 77 year old mother in hopes she likes it but since she likes very light scents I doubt she will like it either... if all else fails it will go into the pile for unwanted items for someone to take at Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But please... this is just my OPINION and like I said I&#x27;m (and my daughter) seem to be in the minority.</li>
            <li> So many compliments! Scent is clean!</li>
            <li> Very Rare! Awesome Seller. Great Price! Get it while it lasts. Product as described.</li>
            <li> Did not smell like Patchouli at all.  I have purchased many oils, perfumes etc to mimic the Spiritual Sky Patchouli oil I bought years ago and more recently on Amazon.  Nothing smells as good.  I was looking for a perfume to use in conjunction with my oil.  Will continue to look.</li>
            <li> Scent does&#x27; last at all.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes! So glad I was Abe to find it</li>
            <li> OMG!!!!! This is my fragrance for over 20 yrs. .I just looooove looooove this nice cool  fresh scent..I will give this a 10 star if there was...Every where I go people ask me what am I wearing.. .Perry Ellis all the way.</li>
            <li> Received product fast I just didn&#x27;t like the smell. Too much musk scent for me.</li>
            <li> I found this perfume years ago and fell in love with it, wll not wear anything else.  Light enough for casual wear but perfect for work and social events.</li>
            <li> I love this smell and this has become one of my favorites that I cannot live without. You will not be disappointed and can use this just about anywhere. I cant begin to tell you how many compliments I get on a daily basis. One spray goes a long way and last for hours. Once you spray it, it smells up the whole area. Not too strong at all and perfect for any age group. Believe me this is a must have...you wont regret it.</li>
            <li> I was gifted this and fell in love with it. I will always recommend it to anyone. Perry Ellis makes you smell so awesome.</li>
            <li> This is a must have, almost everytime I wear it I receive compliments.  Thank you Amazon for providing this item at a reasonable price.  I love it!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is now my second bottle, all ladies need a bottle of this Perry Ellis Reserve.  Very elegant smell thats loved by that special someone</li>
            <li> There is not much to say just that we have been looking for this perfume for my wife since long time ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The perfume arrived very well packaged and is everything that my wife remembers it was long time ago since she used it for the first time. She loved this and it made an excellent Christmas gift :)</li>
            <li> RECOMMENDED SELLER EXCELLENT PRODUCT</li>
