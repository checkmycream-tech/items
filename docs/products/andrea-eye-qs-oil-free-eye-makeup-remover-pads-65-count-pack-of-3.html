            <li>They are much more effective in removing my makeup.</li>
            <li>Pads work great and do not irritate my eyes, very convenient when travelling too!</li>
            <li>What makes them excellenct is that while they are very gentle on your skin they are extrememly effective at removing your makeup!</li>
            <li>But I needed something better for travel, so I got these pads.  </li>
            <li>The aloe vera version is just perfect especially for contact lens wearers.</li>
            <li>I found these on Amazon at a much better price, and love them.</li>
            <li>Love having them auto - shipped to me.</li>
            <li>Do the math :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have control of your eye make-up removal and be able to do it quickly.</li>

            <li>Gentle but effective.</li>

            <li>They quickly remove eye make-up, don&#x27;t bother my eyes or contacts, and the pads stay moist for months and remain just as effective as first opened.  </li>
            <li>so i feel like i blow through them quickly.</li>
            <li>thanks!!</li>
            <li>I found them in a drug store and will now be buying them on Amazon because they are so economical in the three-pack.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve really struggled to find a way to get it off cleanly.  </li>
            <li>These work pretty well and don&#x27;t bother my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I use waterproof mascara pretty much every day</li>
            <li>they would suffice if you only wear eye makeup, but if you wear foundation then you will easily use 4-5 pads.</li>
            <li>They also don&#x27;t remove eyeliner or waterproof mascara very well.</li>
            <li>I wear contacts and these don&#x27;t really irritate them.  </li>
            <li>I wear lash extensions on a regular basis and I needed something oil free to remove eyeliner but not cause my lashes to come off...</li>
            <li>I have tried many other brands of the years.</li>
            <li>Its handy to keep on the side of the vanity and works quickly without irritating my eyes.</li>
            <li>Tried the oily version first but found it left too much residual oil on my lashes.  </li>
            <li>I stopped using them for a couple days and it returned to normal.  </li>
            <li>very quick and less work.</li>
            <li>Most reasonably priced and works well for heavy eye makeup removal, especially mascara that is waterproof.  </li>
            <li>I wear contacts and do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and wear contacts.</li>
            <li>They burn my eyes and barely remove any makeup.</li>

            <li> They burn my eyes and barely remove any makeup.</li>
            <li> So I only use these now about every other day.</li>
            <li> The pad is thicker than other brands I have used.</li>
            <li> my only issue is that they are too small.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I have to use a few wipes a day</li>
            <li> It does what it says and I don&#x27;t have trouble with my eyes after use.</li>
            <li> However, I noticed after 2 or 3 days it dried out the eyelids.  </li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed in these.</li>
            <li> They remove makeup without any pressure on this delicate skin, plus they do not irritate my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this one stings my eyes while removing make up and it takes a few scrubs to take off all make up.</li>
            <li> Worst product ever.</li>

            <li> I wear contacts and do not have sensitive skin. These burn my eyes, a lot. They also don&#x27;t remove eyeliner or waterproof mascara very well. I was pretty disappointed in these. I will not repurchase or recommend them.</li>
            <li> Excellent product...takes eye makeup right off...thanks!!</li>

            <li> this works amazing to remove make up. very quick and less work. great product I will be buying more later</li>
            <li> Tried the oily version first but found it left too much residual oil on my lashes.  The aloe vera version is just perfect especially for contact lens wearers.</li>
            <li> I have used Almay&#x27;s oil-free eye makeup removal pads for years. I found these on Amazon at a much better price, and love them. They are much more effective in removing my makeup.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and wear contacts. These are the only pads I will use. They aren&#x27;t greasy, they work great. I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> This is the only product my wife will use. She loves it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use a lot of make up so using one pad for both eyes is enough and removes all of the waterproof mascara.  The pad is thicker than other brands I have used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years, discovered them by chance.  What makes them excellenct is that while they are very gentle on your skin they are extrememly effective at removing your makeup!</li>
            <li> Most reasonably priced and works well for heavy eye makeup removal, especially mascara that is waterproof.  Does not burn eyes but try not to get it in your eyes when cleaning your lids.</li>
            <li> Worst product ever. They burn my eyes and barely remove any makeup.</li>
            <li> Great value with 65 pads in each container. Pads work great and do not irritate my eyes, very convenient when travelling too!</li>
            <li> I have tried many other brands of the years. They all burn or sting my eyes. Some leave an oily film. The Andrea oil free makeup remover pads are wonderful. Gentle but effective. Love having them auto - shipped to me.</li>
            <li> It does what it says and I don&#x27;t have trouble with my eyes after use.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to purchase this product after reading all of the great reviews. Unfortunately, this one stings my eyes while removing make up and it takes a few scrubs to take off all make up. The product may work well for others, but didn&#x27;t work for me. 3 Stars.</li>
            <li> Very gentle, effective eye makeup remover</li>
            <li> It does the job for removing eye makeup.  However, I noticed after 2 or 3 days it dried out the eyelids.  I stopped using them for a couple days and it returned to normal.  So I only use these now about every other day.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  Its handy to keep on the side of the vanity and works quickly without irritating my eyes.</li>
            <li> Takes makeup off very easily with out pulling skin.  Great price!  3 jars of 65 count per jar.  Do the math :)</li>
            <li> It removes makeup easily, does not irritate eyes like others do. my only issue is that they are too small. they&#x27;re about the size of a silver dollar. they would suffice if you only wear eye makeup, but if you wear foundation then you will easily use 4-5 pads.</li>
            <li> These are awesome!  They quickly remove eye make-up, don&#x27;t bother my eyes or contacts, and the pads stay moist for months and remain just as effective as first opened.  It&#x27;s nice to have control of your eye make-up removal and be able to do it quickly.</li>
