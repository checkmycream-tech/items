            <li>Reasonably priced and great prices!  </li>

            <li>She rubbed it into her lower abdomen and applied a warm towel on top for relaxing relief.  </li>

            <li>I love Edens Garden oils.  </li>
            <li>love it, love it.  </li>
            <li>In a matter of two weeks I could see significant improvement even though he was able to do it as many times per day as recommended.  </li>
            <li>I like them better than Aura Cacia, and they are significantly more economical, since you&#x27;re not paying for branding.  </li>
            <li>Strong and gonna be a fixture in my collection.</li>
            <li>We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s just okay, I&#x27;ll go back to purchasing from MRH, NAN, and BHH for a more superior oil.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly!  </li>
            <li>I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM.</li>
            <li>Great essential oil to use.  </li>
            <li>These 100% therapeutic essential oils are great for aromatherapy as well as making healing balms, and ointments.  </li>
            <li>I can afford oils for my special needs daughter.</li>
            <li>I love their oils and they are at a decent price!</li>
            <li>I was trying to decide whether to buy Bergamot Or Sweet Marjoram.</li>
            <li>That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten a few of Eden&#x27;s Garden&#x27;s oils and have felt they are great quality for the price.</li>
            <li>and they have organic oils made in London, but only make so many available to us in the U.S.</li>
            <li>Very very reasonably priced very fast shipping</li>
            <li>Seems to be exactly as it should be.</li>
            <li>IT IS THE FIRST TIME I GOT MARJORAM OIL</li>
            <li>I use this a lot in a warm bath for her feet or paired with a carrier oil and Helichrysm to rub her feet down.  </li>
            <li>Edens Garden are pure, quality oils.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Edens Garden</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about this Sweet Marjoram.  </li>
            <li>Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that EG gives back to YWAM and Teen Challenge.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased oils other places and they just aren&#x27;t as true and intense as the Edens Gardens oils</li>

            <li> Her Sweet Marjoram smelled just like this one, but this one was much less expensive.</li>

            <li> I put it on my arthritic knee and the pain goes away. Amazing.</li>
            <li> A nice EO which smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> great price for this product</li>
            <li> just started will update</li>
            <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living. I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM. Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers. We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price. The reason it is a fraction of the price is because it does not have about 3 to 5 levels of compensations for its representatives built into the margins, which drastically reduces the overhead. That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden. From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden. If you are one of the 1 - 5% making great money with an MLM, more power to you! But for everyone else, this oil matches up well with the best of them.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend&#x27;s toe nails as they were black with fungus.  I read up on treating toenail fungus and this product was recommended.  In a matter of two weeks I could see significant improvement even though he was able to do it as many times per day as recommended.  He continues to show improvement - nails are clearing up nicely.  I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> all of my reviews will be the same with Edens Garden Oils. This has become my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; store for my essential oils, plain and simple.</li>
            <li> Eden&#x27;s  Garden has pure wonderful oils. Love there products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten a few of Eden&#x27;s Garden&#x27;s oils and have felt they are great quality for the price. I would put them up to other larger name companies running around selling at double/triple the price.</li>
            <li> Love using this at night for aching muscles!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to save money, so I thought I&#x27;d try this brand.  While it&#x27;s just okay, I&#x27;ll go back to purchasing from MRH, NAN, and BHH for a more superior oil.</li>
            <li> Seems to be exactly as it should be. My friend sells Doterra and I was smelling all of her oils. Her Sweet Marjoram smelled just like this one, but this one was much less expensive. This oil, to me, smells a lot like paint thinner! I was trying to decide whether to buy Bergamot Or Sweet Marjoram. I went with the Marjoram. I found out that I like the smell of the Bergamot better. I&#x27;ll buy it later.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this Sweet Marjoram.  This is one of my go to oils.  It is the bomb for sore muscles, and to help me sleep.  I have Fibromyalgia and sore muscles, painful feet and insomnia are a daily thing and this oil is one I use a lot.  My daughter is a dancer and also works on her feet all day.  I use this a lot in a warm bath for her feet or paired with a carrier oil and Helichrysm to rub her feet down.  I love this oil!!</li>
            <li> with oils from Edens Gardens.  I&#x27;ve purchased oils other places and they just aren&#x27;t as true and intense as the Edens Gardens oils</li>
            <li> Love these oils.  Reasonably priced and great prices!  The product book they send with every order is outstanding!</li>
            <li> Love it. Great essential oil to use.  thank you</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied and will do business, again. Thank You</li>
            <li> purchased this product to relieve essential tremors however it did not work for this purpose.</li>
            <li> I used this oil as a blend with Clary Sage, Chamomile and Rosewood oil for severe menstrual cramps for my daughter.  I used Olive oil as a carrier oil.  She rubbed it into her lower abdomen and applied a warm towel on top for relaxing relief.  It&#x27;s helped with her cramps, irritability and anxiety that comes along with her monthly period.  I love Edens Garden oils.  Wonderful quality, beautiful packaging, fast shipping.  Very happy!</li>
            <li> These 100% therapeutic essential oils are great for aromatherapy as well as making healing balms, and ointments.  I also like the synergy blends, which they have a lot of.  They use oils that are harder to come by.  The synergy blends have blends such as Relax, germ Aid, Muscle Aid, aphrodisiac.  You can find almost any essential oil.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly!  This oils are amazing!!!  Great product!!</li>
            <li> I love their oils and they are at a decent price!</li>
            <li> love it, love it.  Smells so happy!!!! Strong and gonna be a fixture in my collection.</li>
            <li> If you want great oils, at a great price lower than the two main ones that are talked about all the time. Very very reasonably priced very fast shipping I would definately recommend this product</li>
            <li> All of there products are excellent!</li>
            <li> I use this in a recipe to help me sleep.  Works great.</li>
            <li> Excellent oil for oily skin! Edens Garden ships same day and this company is awesome!!</li>
            <li> IT IS THE FIRST TIME I GOT MARJORAM OIL SO AM NOT SURE IF THAT IS THE SMELL OF IT BUT I WILL BE USING IT ANYWAY I WILL NOT JUST THROW IT AWAY IT COST ME MONEY.</li>
            <li> Edens Garden is phenomenal! Their mission to sell at the lower cost is the best ever!!! Thanks to Edens Garden I can afford oils for my special needs daughter.</li>
            <li> Use it with body mist.</li>
            <li> Great product and excellent seller.</li>
            <li> Just what it says. Eden&#x27;s Garden takes good care of their customers.  Have had no problem with any of my shipments.</li>
            <li> Edens Garden are pure, quality oils. I have tried other brands and will always buy from Edens Gardens. Im a consultant for Neal&#x27;s Yard Remedies Organic and they have organic oils made in London, but only make so many available to us in the U.S. so whatever I cannot order from them, I buy from and recommend Edens Garden. I love the fact that EG gives back to YWAM and Teen Challenge. That means a lot and says something about a company. Here is my link if you want to take a look at Neal&#x27;s Yard Remedies Organic skincare, essential oils, and remedies: https://US.NYROrganic.com/shop/kerrimorton</li>
            <li> Great product Awesome value.</li>
            <li> Very pleased, will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Edens Garden oils, as a rule, are excellent.  I like them better than Aura Cacia, and they are significantly more economical, since you&#x27;re not paying for branding.  This company deserves your business if you are into Aromatherapy, fragrance blending, soap making etc.  you will not be disappointed.</li>
