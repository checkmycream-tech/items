            <li>Wilkinson makes a good blade.</li>
            <li>Good blades for the price.</li>
            <li>I get a good number of shaves per cartridge before needing replacement</li>
            <li>In my opinion these are the best blades on the market, always a close comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>I can not believe others found this Wilkinson brand good.</li>
            <li>I use the Track II razor and these are a great value for the price compared to Track II blades and do as good or better of a job.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the quality and cost of this item.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the shave.</li>
            <li>then you&#x27;re probably going to have to spend a bunch more money to have a happy shave.  </li>
            <li>I have been using TRAC II razors for over 40 years and am very satisfied with them.</li>
            <li>Totally safe, no cuts, and a great shave.</li>
            <li>Price is right and service is great!</li>
            <li>Was happy to find the correct one to fit razor.  </li>
            <li>These are the best value and shave really well without burn.  </li>
            <li>As good as or better than what you can buy at any deptment store or grocery.  </li>
            <li>I used to buy this at Walmart until they didn&#x27;t sell anymore, so I started buying Gillete kind they sell.</li>
            <li>We  were thrilled to find these blades.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>As good as Gillette at a better price.</li>
            <li>They surprisingly worked about twice as well as the most popular brand.</li>
            <li>More blades sounds good but in reality each blade generated resistance so it takes more force to shave.</li>
            <li>These blades are not quite as good as original trac 11 blades but the price difference makes them an excellent buy overall.</li>
            <li>Thank you for making these available for purchase!</li>
            <li>Trac II must be getting phased out in favor of the ones with three or more blades, but I have used Trac II blades with an Atra handle for many years.  </li>
            <li>many weeks.  </li>
            <li>Love shaving with  these blades and could never change .</li>
            <li>So glad I was able to get them from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Fast Shipper and Great Product</li>
            <li>My Favorite for years</li>
            <li>So glad I decided to go searching for these blades.  </li>
            <li>Better blades.</li>
            <li>You get many shaves out of them.</li>
            <li>The blades are good and the price is right.</li>
            <li>ll Plus is almost as good as the Gillette blades ,but at a very affordable price .</li>
            <li>This was a good choice and is very satisfactory.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using them for 3-4 weeks now and the quality is even better than the original Gillette&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>they are as described and arrived very quick.</li>
            <li>The razor cartridge does not slide easily onto the twin rails of the handle, but with patience it can be made to work.  </li>
            <li>We finally found them on Amazon and now he is a happy man.  </li>
            <li>A lot of the Trac IIs (like Gillette) won&#x27;t fit the Atra handle but the Wilkinson will.  </li>
            <li>These are cheap, and you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>No longer available in stores in our area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Promised to fit Trak II Razor, but it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Three years later, I am still using them and they are doing great.</li>
            <li>Wilkinson are as good as Gillette without gouged by the nearly monopoly prices.</li>
            <li>So far I am very satisfied with these double-edged razor cartridges.</li>
            <li>Seems to cut as well as the original.</li>
            <li>Excellent shave that beats the high-priced brands as usual.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to find them online.</li>
            <li>I looked for this type of product for a long time and couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores and the price makes it a Great buy</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>had not used anything in a twin blade other than the cheap BIC throwaway razors and was delighted to find that these work much better</li>
            <li>Price is right too!</li>
            <li>they are a good value and the  seller is definitely five(5) star.</li>
            <li>I received one good shave per blade, the next time it pulled the hair out.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not bad blades for the price</li>
            <li>I find them to be very good, the lubrication strip is very functional not like on some others where the strip seems to dry up after about 3 days</li>
            <li>Because their license to make the 2 blade models ran out, the original manufacturer had to patent something new and more costly.</li>
            <li>Trac II blades are getting hard to find in stores, it&#x27;s nice to find a good inexpensive source</li>
            <li>My husband has been looking in all the stores in town and out of town for Wilkinson Sword Super II Plus razor blades.  </li>
            <li>Super II Plus and the package appears identical except for the name change.</li>
            <li>but I got he Super II Plus, which is what I used to buy, till they were no longer being sold at the store.  </li>
            <li>the razor blades are great and the price is definitely lower than most blades of equal quality.</li>
            <li>They might just be a little different on the top, but they fit the razor and they shave GREAT.  </li>
            <li>These Wilkinson blades are extremely comfortable and give me a very close shave.</li>
            <li>problem solved -- thanks Wilkinson at a much more reasonable price.)</li>
            <li>Very satisfied and have enough for years, Thanks</li>
            <li>If you have a macho-man beard, or you&#x27;re the kind of guy who buys six-ply toilet paper because you&#x27;re into luxuries,  </li>
            <li>Now I can report that the new cartridges give the same comfortable close shave with long life at a higher price, but are still much cheaper than the best known brand.</li>
            <li>First found this product at Walmart and found them very comparable to the original blades but about 33% of the cost.  </li>
            <li>Many stores no longer carry this blade and regular ones for trac II or atra  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These blades fit an old hand held razor that my father loves and has used for years.</li>
            <li>The blades are exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought these elsewhere before and satisfied with their overall performance...</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Glad to finally find them</li>
            <li>And these blades hold up for a lot of shaving, assuming that the rest of the box is like the first pack I opened.  </li>
            <li>My husband won&#x27;t use any thing else, Has used them for years or more, He had the same Razor all those years too.</li>
            <li>There are other off brands available, but these have been around since the original Wilkinson TRAC II version of the razor came out.</li>
            <li>Long lasting blades at a good price.</li>
            <li>This is one of my smart purchases.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the blades.</li>
            <li>I like the Wilkinsons very well</li>
            <li>As the gilette kind is 3 times the price, I think i&#x27;m going to try different generic brands to find one that&#x27;s sharper and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s really smooth&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>The blades are smooth and last longer then the Gillettes.</li>
            <li>Other than this inconvenience their working fine!</li>
            <li>Fit great, just don&#x27;t seem to be as sharp as they should be, but they work, and the atra II blades are hard to find, and with Gillette wanting $30 for 10 - 12 blades, I&#x27;ll take these all day!</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t use anything else as long as they are available.</li>
            <li>However the need to buy 70 blades when even a full box is only 60 is a drawback.  </li>
            <li>Great blades and hard to find locally.</li>
            <li>Not only is there an obvious 50% savings but the quality of the blades increases their life and therefore, even more savings.</li>
            <li>These (perhaps) &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; a little more but still give a close shave for 7 days.  </li>
            <li>Not too bad but not the best.</li>
            <li>If a lubricating strip occasionally falls off, it is easily stuck back on so that it stays.    </li>
            <li>It is cheap and might be good for thin hair, but not sharp enough for coarse hair.</li>
            <li>had used them in the past and were quite pleased, and then could not find them.</li>
            <li>They shave&lt;br /&gt;close enough, and they fit on my old double-edged razor handle of a different company.</li>
            <li>but it nearly ripped my face off!</li>
            <li>Not a bad deal, but don&#x27;t expect them to stay sharp like costlier blades.</li>
            <li>These work just as good as the original manufacturers blades and are a heck of a lot less expensive.</li>
            <li>They may be selling the older packages until they are gone; however, I can&#x27;t swear that the blades are the same with the new packaging.</li>
            <li>He does not like change and he did not want to give up his old razor.  </li>
            <li>Quality is equivalent to Trac 2 at a far lower price.</li>
            <li>I adamantly refuse to replace my modified razor with a 4- or 5 blade system.</li>
            <li>Call me an old fuddy Duddy , but I like my Trac II razor.</li>
            <li>It only took a few days to get to my door, so much better that going to the store</li>
            <li>These blades sell for a third of the price of other brands and work just fine.</li>
            <li>Super Sharp!  </li>
            <li>(I started having trouble finding original Trac II blades in the stores --</li>
            <li>I have soft facial hair, not thick, so that may help.</li>
            <li>Good &amp; lasting product at less than half price!</li>
            <li>Purchased this set on the theory that it&#x27;d probably last me the rest of my life since I normally grow a beard</li>
            <li>Received exactly what was ordered, performs as expected</li>
            <li>Need to buy a new razor &amp; left with unuseable blades.</li>
            <li>The only down side is that some cartridges quickly lose their grip on the razor and tend to slide off the razor as your shaving.</li>
            <li>They work well, last a long time and are reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>I bought this again online and saw unfortunately that, out of the box,  it is like a blunt Gillette trac ii kind after the gilette has had a week of use.</li>
            <li>I have tried the others like the Fusion but still like the Trac II better and less expensive and seem to last much longer.  </li>

            <li> had not used anything in a twin blade other than the cheap BIC throwaway razors and was delighted to find that these work much better</li>
            <li> Price is right too!</li>
            <li> they are a good value and the  seller is definitely five(5) star.</li>
            <li> I received one good shave per blade, the next time it pulled the hair out.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not bad blades for the price</li>
            <li> I find them to be very good, the lubrication strip is very functional not like on some others where the strip seems to dry up after about 3 days</li>
            <li> Because their license to make the 2 blade models ran out, the original manufacturer had to patent something new and more costly.</li>
            <li> Trac II blades are getting hard to find in stores, it&#x27;s nice to find a good inexpensive source</li>
            <li> My husband has been looking in all the stores in town and out of town for Wilkinson Sword Super II Plus razor blades.  </li>
            <li> Super II Plus and the package appears identical except for the name change.</li>
            <li> but I got he Super II Plus, which is what I used to buy, till they were no longer being sold at the store.  </li>
            <li> the razor blades are great and the price is definitely lower than most blades of equal quality.</li>
            <li> They might just be a little different on the top, but they fit the razor and they shave GREAT.  </li>
            <li> These Wilkinson blades are extremely comfortable and give me a very close shave.</li>
            <li> problem solved -- thanks Wilkinson at a much more reasonable price.)</li>
            <li> Very satisfied and have enough for years, Thanks</li>
            <li> If you have a macho-man beard, or you&#x27;re the kind of guy who buys six-ply toilet paper because you&#x27;re into luxuries,  </li>
            <li> Now I can report that the new cartridges give the same comfortable close shave with long life at a higher price, but are still much cheaper than the best known brand.</li>
            <li> First found this product at Walmart and found them very comparable to the original blades but about 33% of the cost.  </li>
            <li> Many stores no longer carry this blade and regular ones for trac II or atra  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These blades fit an old hand held razor that my father loves and has used for years.</li>
            <li> The blades are exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought these elsewhere before and satisfied with their overall performance...</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Glad to finally find them</li>
            <li> And these blades hold up for a lot of shaving, assuming that the rest of the box is like the first pack I opened.  </li>
            <li> My husband won&#x27;t use any thing else, Has used them for years or more, He had the same Razor all those years too.</li>
            <li> There are other off brands available, but these have been around since the original Wilkinson TRAC II version of the razor came out.</li>
            <li> Long lasting blades at a good price.</li>
            <li> This is one of my smart purchases.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for the blades.</li>
            <li> I like the Wilkinsons very well</li>
            <li> As the gilette kind is 3 times the price, I think i&#x27;m going to try different generic brands to find one that&#x27;s sharper and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s really smooth&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> The blades are smooth and last longer then the Gillettes.</li>
            <li> Other than this inconvenience their working fine!</li>
            <li> Fit great, just don&#x27;t seem to be as sharp as they should be, but they work, and the atra II blades are hard to find, and with Gillette wanting $30 for 10 - 12 blades, I&#x27;ll take these all day!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use anything else as long as they are available.</li>
            <li> However the need to buy 70 blades when even a full box is only 60 is a drawback.  </li>
            <li> Great blades and hard to find locally.</li>
            <li> Not only is there an obvious 50% savings but the quality of the blades increases their life and therefore, even more savings.</li>
            <li> These (perhaps) &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; a little more but still give a close shave for 7 days.  </li>
            <li> Not too bad but not the best.</li>
            <li> If a lubricating strip occasionally falls off, it is easily stuck back on so that it stays.    </li>
            <li> It is cheap and might be good for thin hair, but not sharp enough for coarse hair.</li>
            <li> had used them in the past and were quite pleased, and then could not find them.</li>
            <li> They shave&lt;br /&gt;close enough, and they fit on my old double-edged razor handle of a different company.</li>
            <li> but it nearly ripped my face off!</li>
            <li> Not a bad deal, but don&#x27;t expect them to stay sharp like costlier blades.</li>
            <li> These work just as good as the original manufacturers blades and are a heck of a lot less expensive.</li>
            <li> They may be selling the older packages until they are gone; however, I can&#x27;t swear that the blades are the same with the new packaging.</li>
            <li> He does not like change and he did not want to give up his old razor.  </li>
            <li> Quality is equivalent to Trac 2 at a far lower price.</li>
            <li> I adamantly refuse to replace my modified razor with a 4- or 5 blade system.</li>
            <li> Call me an old fuddy Duddy , but I like my Trac II razor.</li>
            <li> It only took a few days to get to my door, so much better that going to the store</li>
            <li> These blades sell for a third of the price of other brands and work just fine.</li>
            <li> Super Sharp!  </li>
            <li> (I started having trouble finding original Trac II blades in the stores --</li>
            <li> I have soft facial hair, not thick, so that may help.</li>
            <li> Good &amp; lasting product at less than half price!</li>
            <li> Purchased this set on the theory that it&#x27;d probably last me the rest of my life since I normally grow a beard</li>
            <li> Received exactly what was ordered, performs as expected</li>
            <li> Need to buy a new razor &amp; left with unuseable blades.</li>
            <li> The only down side is that some cartridges quickly lose their grip on the razor and tend to slide off the razor as your shaving.</li>
            <li> They work well, last a long time and are reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> I bought this again online and saw unfortunately that, out of the box,  it is like a blunt Gillette trac ii kind after the gilette has had a week of use.</li>
            <li> I have tried the others like the Fusion but still like the Trac II better and less expensive and seem to last much longer.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a really tough beard, so they last for quite a long time, and they give a reasonably comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> great price and long lasting blades, hate to pay for the triple or quadruple blades  that do not last any longer</li>
            <li> I have been using these blades for a long time, but the local big box store quit stocking them.  </li>
            <li> do not fit this particular razor.</li>
            <li> Last just as long as Gillet blades.</li>
            <li> They are lasting twice as long as others.</li>
            <li> Hard to find older replacement blades in the stores now a days, these will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> hey are just what I expected and boy do they last.</li>
            <li> Trac-II long time lover...</li>
            <li> so I ordered from Amazon which I should have done long ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m set for a long time.</li>
            <li> A step above shaving with a sharp rock.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands but always come back to the Wilkinson Sword brand.</li>
            <li> I slipped a length of stainless steel tubing over the handle of my Trac II razor to give it the extra heft it needs to resist deflection  and wade through tough whiskers.</li>
            <li> Given the overall quality of the blades and the price point, I just accept these occasional lemons as a small price to pay given the long term savings.</li>
            <li> They are getting harder to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Every once in awhile during the last few weeks I rub my neck and think, &amp;#34;damn</li>
            <li> I gave a few to my Mom too as she has the same razor.</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace a 3-blade Extreme razor and it in turn replaced a 5-blade razor.</li>
            <li> Good for the head, bad for the tough beard.</li>
            <li> and there is much less drag than with the 3-blade and 5-blade razors.</li>
            <li> I have used these blades for years and really like them, but it&#x27;s crazy when I can no longer get them locally and have to order them online.</li>
            <li> Not worth a penny a piece.</li>
            <li> Quality went down and prices went up.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that this form of Wilkinson razor blades would be inferior to those previously purchased at retail.  </li>
            <li> Who needs 4 or 5 blades in a razor blade and a new expensive handle, like those being pushed onto the gullible consumer?  </li>
            <li> These are harder and harder to find, impossible if you don&#x27;t want the gooey strips.</li>
            <li> These are so hard to find...met all of our expectations.</li>
            <li> The Wilkinson blades are hard to find.</li>
            <li> Dull after one shave.</li>
            <li> Hard to find this style blade in the brick and mortar stores.  </li>
            <li> Depicted is a package with the name changed to Twin II Plus, but Amazon&#x27;s secondary supplier sent packs of</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t find the ones with LubraStrip AND that little pushing thing that pushed out all hair from in between the blades...</li>
            <li> and then the razor pulls across the skin not good.</li>
            <li> That meant they were a promotional offering and that Wilkinson Sword would either economize on quality or raise the price when they had built a customer base, so I bought up a long term supply.</li>
            <li> It has gotten difficult to find replacement blades for the Atra handle</li>
            <li> and, hoo-boy, are they ever expensive.  </li>
            <li> As any TRAC II user knows, blades are difficult to find in retail stores; therefore, I have started ordering a years supply online.</li>
            <li> Had been unable to located them again until now.  </li>
            <li> The blades cut my face badly.</li>
            <li> If you are appalled by the price of Gillette Trac-II blades, try these.  </li>
            <li> I refuse to pay the outrageous prices for brand name razor blades.</li>
            <li> I used trac II since they were invented and NEVER had crap like this!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My husband has been looking in all the stores in town and out of town for Wilkinson Sword Super II Plus razor blades.  He has been looking for over a year.  We finally found them on Amazon and now he is a happy man.  He does not like change and he did not want to give up his old razor.  Thanks for the blades.</li>
            <li> Product is great, delivery was prompt.  The Trac II and Atra format are the best blades.  Wilkinson are as good as Gillette without gouged by the nearly monopoly prices.</li>
            <li> It has gotten difficult to find replacement blades for the Atra handle and, hoo-boy, are they ever expensive.  These should do the trick.</li>
            <li> Great buy.  Blades are very good.</li>
            <li> These are the best value and shave really well without burn.  I get 4 shaves per twin blade, same as name brand twins.  Wal Mart carried them for years but seems to have dropped them.  Still on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the quality and cost of this item.</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace a 3-blade Extreme razor and it in turn replaced a 5-blade razor. The narrow profile of these blades makes it much easier to shave the area between my lip and my nose without nicking myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had not used anything in a twin blade other than the cheap BIC throwaway razors and was delighted to find that these work much better and there is much less drag than with the 3-blade and 5-blade razors. More blades sounds good but in reality each blade generated resistance so it takes more force to shave.</li>
            <li> My husband loves these</li>
            <li> Have been using these blades for some time and been purchasing at Walmart. They no longer carry them. These blades sell for a third of the price of other brands and work just fine.</li>
            <li> great price and long lasting blades, hate to pay for the triple or quadruple blades  that do not last any longer</li>
            <li> The Wilkinson Twin ll Plus is almost as good as the Gillette blades ,but at a very affordable price . Great value !!</li>
            <li> If you are appalled by the price of Gillette Trac-II blades, try these.  Good &amp; lasting product at less than half price!</li>
            <li> These are so hard to find...met all of our expectations. Thank you for making these available for purchase! Great job.</li>
            <li> Trac II must be getting phased out in favor of the ones with three or more blades, but I have used Trac II blades with an Atra handle for many years.  I have tried the others like the Fusion but still like the Trac II better and less expensive and seem to last much longer.  The Fusion blade lasted about a week and the Trac II many weeks.  A lot of the Trac IIs (like Gillette) won&#x27;t fit the Atra handle but the Wilkinson will.  It is the only one I have found that will.  I guess I will use the Trac II until they quit making it but, since I am just about at the end of the forth quarter, that shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.  I like the Wilkinsons very well</li>
            <li> Could not find blades any where,fair purchase ,no problems arrive ahead of time.Love shaving with  these blades and could never change . Thank You Wilkinson Sword!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a TRAC II razor for over 30-years and these are the perfect for it. There are other off brands available, but these have been around since the original Wilkinson TRAC II version of the razor came out.</li>
            <li> Product was received within estimated time.  I was concerned that this form of Wilkinson razor blades would be inferior to those previously purchased at retail.  I picked one packet to test.  These (perhaps) &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; a little more but still give a close shave for 7 days.  If they hadn&#x27;t I would have sent them back.  Quality is equivalent to Trac 2 at a far lower price.</li>
            <li> These are cheap, and you get what you pay for. Not a bad deal, but don&#x27;t expect them to stay sharp like costlier blades.</li>
            <li> Not too bad but not the best. A step above shaving with a sharp rock.</li>
            <li> As good as or better than what you can buy at any deptment store or grocery.  Last just as long as Gillet blades.</li>
            <li> Bought these here because walmart doesn&#x27;t handle them anymore. I use the Track II razor and these are a great value for the price compared to Track II blades and do as good or better of a job.</li>
            <li> hey are just what I expected and boy do they last.</li>
            <li> Was happy to find the correct one to fit razor.  However the need to buy 70 blades when even a full box is only 60 is a drawback.  Many stores no longer carry this blade and regular ones for trac II or atra  do not fit this particular razor.</li>
            <li> I have been using these blades for 30 years. They are getting harder to find in stores. Great product .Great price.</li>
            <li> No longer available in stores in our area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades fit an old hand held razor that my father loves and has used for years.</li>
            <li> Excellent deal for the price</li>
            <li> The best razors for Trac II. The Wilkinson blades are hard to find. I&#x27;m glad I did!!!!</li>
            <li> I used to buy this at Walmart until they didn&#x27;t sell anymore, so I started buying Gillete kind they sell. I bought this again online and saw unfortunately that, out of the box,  it is like a blunt Gillette trac ii kind after the gilette has had a week of use. It is cheap and might be good for thin hair, but not sharp enough for coarse hair. As the gilette kind is 3 times the price, I think i&#x27;m going to try different generic brands to find one that&#x27;s sharper and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts. I&#x27;ve been using them for 3-4 weeks now and the quality is even better than the original Gillette&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;For the price of 3 retail packages I got 6. Not only is there an obvious 50% savings but the quality of the blades increases their life and therefore, even more savings. If you shave with a Twin II shaver... These are the blades you want.</li>
            <li> We  were thrilled to find these blades.&lt;br /&gt;We had used them in the past and were quite pleased, and then could not find them.Thank you</li>
            <li> Awesome deal--Thank you!!</li>
            <li> the razor blades are great and the price is definitely lower than most blades of equal quality. they are a good value and the  seller is definitely five(5) star. they are as described and arrived very quick.</li>
            <li> I could not find these razor blades anywhere, Walmart, Target, Meijer. So I tried on line and found them, they are just about the same cost as I paid for them at Walmart&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the same razor for years and have used this brand of blades for the last couple of years.  I find them to be very good, the lubrication strip is very functional not like on some others where the strip seems to dry up after about 3 days and then the razor pulls across the skin not good.</li>
            <li> At fifty cents a blade, a very good deal. Wish they were not  made in China though. What isn&#x27;t !!</li>
            <li> So far I am very satisfied with these double-edged razor cartridges. They shave&lt;br /&gt;close enough, and they fit on my old double-edged razor handle of a different company.</li>
            <li> product as described, on time delivery, good pricing</li>
            <li> Dull after one shave. Not worth a penny a piece.</li>
            <li> They work well, last a long time and are reasonably priced.  It only took a few days to get to my door, so much better that going to the store</li>
            <li> The blades are exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Good for the head, bad for the tough beard.</li>
            <li> I have been using these blades for years and find them to be very good in spite of waning quality from time to time.  They used to be made in the USA but Wilkinson decided to go to China in order to meet or beat their blade competition who were already manufacturing their blades in China.  Price is right too!</li>
            <li> Purchased this set on the theory that it&#x27;d probably last me the rest of my life since I normally grow a beard</li>
            <li> Works great in my Trac II razor. Very pleased with the shave. (I started having trouble finding original Trac II blades in the stores -- problem solved -- thanks Wilkinson at a much more reasonable price.)</li>
            <li> I have been using these blades for a long time, but the local big box store quit stocking them.  So glad I was able to get them from Amazon.  I buy a box and share with my son.  Who needs 4 or 5 blades in a razor blade and a new expensive handle, like those being pushed onto the gullible consumer?  Because their license to make the 2 blade models ran out, the original manufacturer had to patent something new and more costly. These work just as good as the original manufacturers blades and are a heck of a lot less expensive.</li>
            <li> GREAT AND SHAVING LIKE A GOOD BLADE SHOULD!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for some time. My review is somewhat slanted. I like these blades a lot. I like the c</li>
            <li> These are harder and harder to find, impossible if you don&#x27;t want the gooey strips. Wilkinson makes a good blade. There&#x27;s an off brand that fits the razor but it nearly ripped my face off!</li>
            <li> Hubby has been using this brand of razor blade for years.  Then all of the sudden, the local stores no longer carried it.  We bought enough to last a couple of years!</li>
            <li> Good blades for the price. Trac II blades are getting hard to find in stores, it&#x27;s nice to find a good inexpensive source</li>
            <li> Fit great, just don&#x27;t seem to be as sharp as they should be, but they work, and the atra II blades are hard to find, and with Gillette wanting $30 for 10 - 12 blades, I&#x27;ll take these all day!</li>
            <li> Shaves just as well as the Trac II blades but for only a third of the price!!! I get a good number of shaves per cartridge before needing replacement I have soft facial hair, not thick, so that may help. The only down side is that some cartridges quickly lose their grip on the razor and tend to slide off the razor as your shaving. I say about 1-2 per package of 10 will do this. Given the overall quality of the blades and the price point, I just accept these occasional lemons as a small price to pay given the long term savings.</li>
            <li> The product and delivery was great.</li>
            <li> Long lasting blades at a good price.</li>
            <li> Trac-II long time lover...I&#x27;ve bought these elsewhere before and satisfied with their overall performance...Wilkinson Sword is a well known name...thank you</li>
            <li> Seems to cut as well as the original.</li>
            <li> Great price, good blades</li>
            <li> These do a great job for me.  I don&#x27;t have a really tough beard, so they last for quite a long time, and they give a reasonably comfortable shave.  If you have a macho-man beard, or you&#x27;re the kind of guy who buys six-ply toilet paper because you&#x27;re into luxuries,  then you&#x27;re probably going to have to spend a bunch more money to have a happy shave.  For the rest of us, we can buy these and spend our savings on PBR.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipper and Great Product *****</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t find the ones with LubraStrip AND that little pushing thing that pushed out all hair from in between the blades... the ones in Europe still have that. Other than this inconvenience their working fine!</li>
            <li> These blades are not quite as good as original trac 11 blades but the price difference makes them an excellent buy overall.</li>
            <li> My local Wal Mart stopped selling these blades so I ordered from Amazon which I should have done long ago. I refuse to pay the outrageous prices for brand name razor blades. These Wilkinson blades are extremely comfortable and give me a very close shave. I won&#x27;t use anything else as long as they are available.</li>
            <li> Received exactly what was ordered, performs as expected</li>
            <li> As good as Gillette at a better price.</li>
            <li> great just what I wanted</li>
            <li> I slipped a length of stainless steel tubing over the handle of my Trac II razor to give it the extra heft it needs to resist deflection  and wade through tough whiskers. I adamantly refuse to replace my modified razor with a 4- or 5 blade system. When I saw 10 of these cartridges in WalMart for $2 and change, I had to try them. They surprisingly worked about twice as well as the most popular brand. That meant they were a promotional offering and that Wilkinson Sword would either economize on quality or raise the price when they had built a customer base, so I bought up a long term supply. Now I can report that the new cartridges give the same comfortable close shave with long life at a higher price, but are still much cheaper than the best known brand. If a lubricating strip occasionally falls off, it is easily stuck back on so that it stays.    Depicted is a package with the name changed to Twin II Plus, but Amazon&#x27;s secondary supplier sent packs of Super II Plus and the package appears identical except for the name change. They may be selling the older packages until they are gone; however, I can&#x27;t swear that the blades are the same with the new packaging.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product. In my opinion these are the best blades on the market, always a close comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Great blades and hard to find locally. I have tried other brands but always come back to the Wilkinson Sword brand.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, best value.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied and have enough for years, Thanks</li>
            <li> Super Sharp!  Just Great!!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  The blades are good and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Top quality and best value anywhere.</li>
            <li> Price is right and service is great!</li>
            <li> Call me an old fuddy Duddy , but I like my Trac II razor. I can never find them at any of the local stores, when I do, they are over a dollar per blade. This is a bargain.</li>
            <li> I have been using TRAC II razors for over 40 years and am very satisfied with them. As any TRAC II user knows, blades are difficult to find in retail stores; therefore, I have started ordering a years supply online. These Wilkinson blades are very good.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not bad blades for the price but they are described incorrectly.  The ones I got were made in China not Germany.  That was one of the reasons I bought them.</li>
            <li> Excellent shave that beats the high-priced brands as usual.  My Favorite for years</li>
            <li> The blade works well, and doesn&#x27;t rust when I leave it in the shower.  That&#x27;s a huge plus!!!!  I only gave it 4 stars, however, because the clamps on the back are somewhat flimsy and tend to break off if you drop your razor on the floor.</li>
            <li> Found these before in Bi-Lo and they worked great in my Trac II razor. Then I could not find them again. I was excited to find them online. Anyone having a Trac II razor should try these (they are a lot cheaper than the regular Trac II blades). Thanks</li>
            <li> Wilkinson Sword blades was a wonderful, long-lasting blade when I used them decades ago.  Had been unable to located them again until now.  Glad to finally find them, so I ordered a big supply!</li>
            <li> Have been using this brand for years and always had very good results from them..  You can&#x27;t beat this price..</li>
            <li> This was a good choice and is very satisfactory.  Would recommend these blades.  They are lasting twice as long as others.</li>
            <li> I looked for this type of product for a long time and couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores and the price makes it a Great buy</li>
            <li> I have used these blades for years and really like them, but it&#x27;s crazy when I can no longer get them locally and have to order them online.</li>
            <li> I received one good shave per blade, the next time it pulled the hair out. I can not believe others found this Wilkinson brand good. I used trac II since they were invented and NEVER had crap like this!!!</li>
            <li> I am 61 years of age, so I&#x27;ve shaved awhile.  Every once in awhile during the last few weeks I rub my neck and think, &amp;#34;damn, that&#x27;s really smooth&amp;#34;.  So, it&#x27;s a great shave.  The razor cartridge does not slide easily onto the twin rails of the handle, but with patience it can be made to work.  And these blades hold up for a lot of shaving, assuming that the rest of the box is like the first pack I opened.  This is one of my smart purchases.  I&#x27;m set for a long time.</li>
            <li> These blades are great at 1/3 the price of retail!</li>
            <li> My husband won&#x27;t use any thing else, Has used them for years or more, He had the same Razor all those years too.</li>
            <li> This is GREAT, the pic shows Twin II Plus but I got he Super II Plus, which is what I used to buy, till they were no longer being sold at the store.  They might just be a little different on the top, but they fit the razor and they shave GREAT.  So glad I decided to go searching for these blades.  I gave a few to my Mom too as she has the same razor. THX</li>
            <li> Hard to find older replacement blades in the stores now a days, these will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Another made in China junk product. The blades cut my face badly. Amazon is offering a Wilkinson blade product- Duplo II- made in Germany. Better blades. Totally safe, no cuts, and a great shave.</li>
            <li> Promised to fit Trak II Razor, but it didn&#x27;t.  Need to buy a new razor &amp; left with unuseable blades.</li>
            <li> I used Gillette blades for years. Quality went down and prices went up. For a fraction of the price i decided to give a try to Wilkinson. I was not disappointed. The blades are smooth and last longer then the Gillettes. ADDING TO MY 2014 REVIEW... Three years later, I am still using them and they are doing great. You get many shaves out of them.</li>
            <li> Hard to find this style blade in the brick and mortar stores.  Way more practical than those silly five blade arrangements that don&#x27;t shave a bit closer.</li>
            <li> First found this product at Walmart and found them very comparable to the original blades but about 33% of the cost.  These are great for me.</li>
