            <li>Although I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this BB shampoo,  I do use two Bumble and Bumble products that I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li>It would be good for fine hair as well</li>
            <li>I like Shea Moisture products better.  </li>
            <li>They are sulfate, silicone and cruelty free and they leave my hair gloriously shiny and moisturized and they&#x27;re $11 a bottle!  </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve found another line that&#x27;s a fraction of the price and works phenomenally well.  </li>

            <li>Ok shampoo but not any more effective than argan oil shampoo or other sulfate free shampoos.</li>
            <li>For me, it was nothing special.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed the sellers on Amazon ask a fair amount for shipping, which sucks.  </li>
            <li>Raw shampoo is a different animal and although it&#x27;s sulfate free (and therefore color safe) it takes about 2 or 3 uses for the hair and scalp to respond.  </li>

            <li>I wanted to love this....but can only use it once in awhile - stick with the conditioner on dry thirsty ends and the invisible oil for blowdrying.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to B&amp;B, and I&#x27;m now a fan.  </li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m short on cash, I&#x27;ll use Smooth Criminal primer, available at Sally&#x27;s.  </li>

            <li> This is a gift for my wife.  She LOVES this.  Also, I received this quickly with no issues</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at Sephora and loved it so much that I ordered it on Amazon and it is NOT the same product at all!  It neither felt or smelled the same.  The same goes for the conditioner I got.  I hope to return it.</li>
            <li> Love this product along with the Conditioner, and Primer! Smells great, leaves my hair manageable and soft. One of three shampoos i use.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo at Sephora and ended up returning it.  For me, it was nothing special.  I like Shea Moisture products better.  They are sulfate, silicone and cruelty free and they leave my hair gloriously shiny and moisturized and they&#x27;re $11 a bottle!  The shampoos, conditioners and masks are all good.  I especially love the raw shea butter formula.  Raw shampoo is a different animal and although it&#x27;s sulfate free (and therefore color safe) it takes about 2 or 3 uses for the hair and scalp to respond.  I found this to be the case and when my hair responded after the initial period, it was fantastic!!  I use the raw shea butter mask, as well as the 10 in 1 formula, for 5 minutes in the shower and once a week for 45 minutes with a heat cap.  I also love the SM Jamaican Black Castor Oil clarifying shampoo with apple cider vinegar.  Once a week it washes away all traces of styling products and hairspray and leaves my hair light and bouncy.  It smells divine, really clean and fresh.  All the SM products I&#x27;ve tried have lived up to their promises and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about them.  The shampoos lather well and the conditioners do an excellent job for any hair type. Although I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this BB shampoo,  I do use two Bumble and Bumble products that I can&#x27;t live without. First is the Invisible Oil Primer, which leaves my hair really shiny, frizz free and adds thermal protection.  It&#x27;s really light and not at all greasy.  It would be good for fine hair as well (my hair is medium in texture and slightly wavy). I spray it on damp hair and let it dry overnight. Also, Does It All styling spray is awesome and really holds my hard-to-hold hair when I use it on dry hair with a curling iron to create loose waves.  It&#x27;s really light and not at all sticky or stiff and it doesn&#x27;t flake.  I don&#x27;t use it as a hairspray because it&#x27;s so expensive and I try my best to conserve it. Instead, I use Nexxus Comb Thru flexible hold hairspray.  It gives invisible hold that looks natural and yet it holds my hair even into the next day.  If I need to touch up my waves the second day, I simply brush it out, recurl my hair (adding a little DIA styling spray) and then respray it with the hairspray.  Almost as good as the Nexxus is Tresemme&#x27;s new runway collection Perfectly Undone hairspray, which is completely unlike their regular light hold formula.  And it&#x27;s about $6 in the drugstore.  I also like Toni and Guy&#x27;s flexible hold hairspray, which works equally well.  The two BB products I&#x27;ve mentioned are expensive, $28 for the DIA spray and the same for the primer.  When I&#x27;m short on cash, I&#x27;ll use Smooth Criminal primer, available at Sally&#x27;s.  It also curbs frizz, leaves my hair shiny and provides thermal protection and costs about $7.  I&#x27;m still looking for a dupe for the DIA spray, but so far, I haven&#x27;t had much luck.  I buy my BB products at Sephora (where you can return them if you don&#x27;t like them, which I did with this shampoo).  I&#x27;ve noticed the sellers on Amazon ask a fair amount for shipping, which sucks.  It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t like this BB shampoo.  It&#x27;s just not all that great.  However, I&#x27;ve found another line that&#x27;s a fraction of the price and works phenomenally well.  Why should I spend more?  Sometimes high end hair products don&#x27;t work any better than their low end counterparts.  And although Shea Moisture isn&#x27;t cheap, it isn&#x27;t expensive either.  And SM products are available at Sally&#x27;s, Walgreens, CVS, Ulta and Target.  However, none of these stores carry the entire SM line and neither does Amazon.  My suggestion is that you try SM before buying this BB shampoo.  There&#x27;s certainly a SM formula that will work for you and all their shampoos and such are sulfate free.  I think you&#x27;ll be as pleased by the results as I am.  Using the products I&#x27;ve mentioned has given me a good hair day nearly every day, something unheard of for me.  My hair looks like I just stepped out of the salon.  And my hair color glows!  Instead of spending money on shampoo and conditioner, spend money on styling products.  I&#x27;ve found that high end stylers are generally better.  That&#x27;s not to say that drugstore brands don&#x27;t work, only that I haven&#x27;t found any that have given me the good results of these higher end products even though I&#x27;ve tried too drugstore brands to count.  Women are suckers for hair care products and we&#x27;re willing to buy whatever product promises great results.  It would be smarter to go by the reviews rather than the blurbs on the packaging. Which is why I&#x27;m reviewing products other than this BB shampoo.  I&#x27;m trying my best to help those with resistant hair like mine save money and time.  Hopefully, it helps people out there who are desperate to find products that live up to their hype.  I&#x27;ve found these few great ones and I want everyone to know about it.  I have a hall closet full of do nothing hair products that I don&#x27;t know what to do with.  I feel guilty (and pissed off) about throwing them out, but they don&#x27;t work and I certainly don&#x27;t want to give someone else something that sucks.  So I&#x27;m stuck.  Maybe one day I&#x27;ll get fed up enough to toss them out.  I definitely could use more room in the closet. If you try several different ways to make something work and it simply doesn&#x27;t, then it&#x27;s time to let go.  I&#x27;m cleaning out that closet right now.  I&#x27;ve had enough of failed hair care.  At least I can recycle the bottles.  That&#x27;s something, isn&#x27;t it?.pending money on shampoo and conditioner, spend money on styling products.

            <li> Works great on my thick curly frizzy hair</li>
            <li> Great product for my curly friz prone hair.</li>
            <li> Didnt make my dry, strawlike hair any softer or silkier. Actually felt a little bit as though it was stripping. Had to use extra conditioner to make hair even combable after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair a little dry but the conditioner makes up for it.</li>
            <li> Ok shampoo but not any more effective than argan oil shampoo or other sulfate free shampoos.</li>
            <li> smells great and works its amazing</li>
            <li> The wife loves it and Timely arrival too.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo I have ever used!</li>
            <li> The best of B&amp;B.  Stick with the shampoo conditioner and primer.  The oil in this line is worthless.  Try Kendi Bamboo oil.</li>
            <li> I love this!!! Amazon suggested it and I went with it. Thank you amazon!</li>
            <li> A good choice if you have dry, over processed hair.  I love all Bumble &amp; Bumble products and this&lt;br /&gt;was a great find!</li>
            <li> Shampoo is good! Price... Not so much. It&#x27;s cheaper elsewhere,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to B&amp;B, and I&#x27;m now a fan.  I use all the Invisible Oil product, and none wear your hair down.  You don&#x27;t need much product, which means this product will last a long time.  The shampoo smells great.&lt;br /&gt;I have color-treated hair, and it&#x27;s exposed to well water on a daily basis.  Try it!</li>
            <li> Expensive so only got 4 stars but it really works. Smells great and tames the frizzies.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this....but can only use it once in awhile - stick with the conditioner on dry thirsty ends and the invisible oil for blowdrying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the shampoo is soooo heavy and greasy! my stylist has this at her (expensive! B&amp;b!) salon, and agrees that the shampoo is just TOO much oil and heaviness. although she loves the conditioner like I do! stick with that, forget this shampoo.</li>
