            <li> Considering the selling price is 1/3 the cost of an actual Shellac manicure, this is a pretty good product.  My only qualm is that it is a lot more transparent than expected.  In the bottle, it has a pretty pink hue, but on the actual nails it looks almost transparent.  If a very very sheer pink/nude hue is what you&#x27;re going for, this is perfect.  Otherwise, go for Romantique or experiment with a more opaque color.</li>
            <li> Beautiful light, opaque pink color -- just what I wanted!  Looks natural!  Has a slight hint of shimmer in it!</li>
            <li> This color is very sheer with a hint of sparkle.  I like it instead of plain clear.  You definitely won&#x27;t like it if you are looking for any color.  Stays on GREAT!</li>
            <li> Almost invisible on the nail. That is what I wanted so it is perfect, but just an FYI for someone who thinks it will look very pink on their nail.</li>
            <li> Just right for work, subtle color</li>
            <li> There is no doubt that shellac lasts longer than regular nail polish. This color is light and it goes unnoticed even if it has chipped.</li>
            <li> I do my own nails at home and love CND Shellac. It is a great prodct and truly does last at least 14 days. My nails always look amazing and I get a ton of compliments. I also love the colors and the option to layer and create new colors is awesome.</li>
            <li> This is just a clear polish with a hint of pink.  It is very sheer and that&#x27;s after 4 coats.  I wish CND would indicate how these polishes cover i.e. matte, gloss, sheer, shimmer.  I thought this would have coverage like Romantique since the bottles look about the same.It may be time to try another brand.</li>
            <li> Slight pink hue to this shellac.  Looks so natural and my nails show through the almost transparency.  Get lots of compliments using this product.  Many folks think I have on fake nails.  Just my own that look great.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed. This color is not true to what the photo showed online. It is extremely light and hard to see. I will not be using it and very upset that I&#x27;m stuck with it.</li>
            <li> This color is very opaque please note. I thought it was a more solid color.</li>
            <li> Although the outside of the bottle looks nothing like the inside color.  This is the perfect pink for your french manicure.</li>
            <li> I wear this product for the first time. It was fantastic and easy to put on the nails.my friends told me many compliments about my nails.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this polish had a little more color. The bottle color is deceiving. After two coats it appears clear with a hint of light pink.</li>
            <li> Color as described - very light, sheer, color with a slightly pinkish pearl finish.  Just what I expected. Pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Pretty, but hard formula to apply.</li>
            <li> Color is great, I just wish it were more opaque. The color matches the bottle, however it is a more clear version, and you can see through to your natural nail with this color. Maybe layered on another color this would be perfect.</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t really love the price I am pleased with the CND product. It&#x27;s high quality and adheres nicely.</li>
            <li> The colour wasn&#x27;t as I expected it to be.  I thought it would be more creamy.  Instead it was clear with a magenta sheen to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product came as it should be.  My dislike is for CND Shellac Beau.&lt;br /&gt;The seller was fantastic.  The product was delivered as expected.  Very Quick.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I purchased this color to pair it with Cream Puff for a French Manicure and it&#x27;s perfect! It&#x27;s a sheer, very subtle pink with multicolor SUBTLE shimmer. You really can&#x27;t see the shimmer unless you&#x27;re in the sun or bright light and it&#x27;s not noticable unless you&#x27;re paying attention. It&#x27;s not sparkly at all, which is what I was looking for. You could wear this color alone if you wanted something very natural looking. It enhances a natural pink nail bed but won&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re wearing pink polish.</li>
            <li> While this wasn&#x27;t the color I wanted (my fault because I didn&#x27;t know the name) - I must say the CND makes the best SHELLAC polish!  It&#x27;s very easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t take long to cure.  This color reminds me of a ballet slipper...  Very pale pink &amp; pretty!</li>
