            <li> Must have lotion to get when you get the massage oil!!!!!!! It smells deliciously sexy. Not too overpowering. Nice consistency of the lotion. Not to thick or thin.</li>
            <li> I happen to visit my girlfriends powder room and this precious stuffage I had to have as my own!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;uberluxuriös&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rainni</li>
            <li> non greasy, scent lasts, but not overpowering</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used this in the past and it is just as I remember....lovely!  I actually felt relaxed when I used it.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to smell good after a shower.  The scent lasts all night long.</li>
            <li> This is just as I expected although it is a glass bottle which is fine. Just the scent I have been looing for</li>
            <li> Multiple attempts to reach out, no one seems to want to fix the issue. Don&#x27;t order from these folks, many other places to buy it online.</li>
            <li> I ended up returning this scent to Bath and Body Works, because I just didn&#x27;t like the smell, it was too &#x27;cologney&#x27;</li>
            <li> Came opened- less than a third spilled, but I was giving as a gift and now can&amp;#34;t....</li>
            <li> the best lotion i&#x27;ve ever smelled and it lasted all day long and next day even!  I love it and will order again</li>
            <li> Always my favorite. Also use the bath wash. Will order again when I get low. Thank you for your help.</li>
            <li> I love it it smells so good, great for date night with the hubby. I love the body wash also. I wish they had a cream also though</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like a dream. A DREAM. You will just keep using it, and using it until you dont have anymore left. Then buy some more.</li>
            <li> The aroma of this body lotion is fabulous!  Every time I use it, at least two people ask me what the scent is and where can they get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Put Love In The Air&amp;#34; is a perfect name for this lotion.</li>
            <li> The aroma is possibly the best in the business.  I bought it for my wife and she puts it on before bed. The aroma is  actually a turn on.</li>

            <li> Love, love, love.  BB&amp;B has these on sale for 5-6 dollars maybe twice a year.  At the time I got these because I was out &amp; didn&#x27;t feel like going to the mall.  The shipping was fast, they were individually wrapped in bubble wrap ( the Aromotherapy line is in glass bottles). I always get compliments on the scent &amp; people stopping me asking me &amp;#34;what I am wearing&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This was a given to me by a friend.  At first it smells good.  The scent is not feminine and its very strong.  I put a little and someone at work told me the smell is too strong and the scent is like manly scent.  She told me not to use it anymore.</li>
            <li> I like the Jasmine Vanilla most. Don&#x27;t get me wrong - this is still an excellent choice.</li>

            <li> THIS IS MY FAVORITE BBW FRAGRANCE AND IT IS VERY HARD TO FIND,,,,GREAT PRICE AND WILL BUY FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN &amp; AGAIN!!!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty strong fragrance. I would not wear it out in public, personally. It&#x27;s okay when I&#x27;m at home.</li>
            <li> best lotion ever. I randomly decided to get it and it smells wonderful.  i dont like super strong scents but this was perfect i plan on getting the whole line of this scent.</li>
            <li> I love Black Currant Vanilla Aromatherapy Body lotion! I use it along with the matching shower gel and hand soap. The scent is deep and layered--a combination of musky florals and berries.</li>
