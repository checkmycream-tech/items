    <ol>
            <li>Does not smell good!  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Great Product.</li>
            <li>my face skin is softer and feels great.</li>
            <li>a comparable price, I would buy a great body lotion like Aesop.</li>
            <li>this oil does everything it claims and you will get many compliments when you use it!!</li>
            <li>It is a skin scent that is chemical free, and makes your skin the best it can be naturally.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>good for firming the skin&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>This body oil smells amazing</li>
            <li>It absorbs nicely  </li>
            <li>Perhaps the product, which I love, would chemically react with plastic and can&#x27;t be in that kind of container.</li>
            <li>RODIN olio lusso is more than a liquid moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I love this product -</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Fragrance of the oil was ok but not impressive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great on older men&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of aromatic oils like jasmine and neroli and thought i would love this.</li>
            <li>AND IT&#x27;S ALSO CHEMICAL FREE</li>
            <li>I  DON&#x27;T FEEL COMFORTABLE WEARING IT OUT,</li>
            <li>the oil soaks into the skin and feels light- not greasy.</li>
            <li>oil is unique</li>
            <li>This oil is truly luxury 100% natural and effective</li>
            <li>The smell fades quickly and the oil is absorbed into your face immediately leaving skin smooth and supple.  </li>
            <li>You must love jasmin as it is the main smell and quite strong.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing packaging for shipping&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>vey good for senitive and tight skin just eases and comforts the skin</li>
            <li>It has a distinct smell, which really reminds me of a tropical flower.  </li>
            <li>Good for massaging your skin to increase circulation, however, not what I expected, considering all of the positive press it gets, particularly at Barney&#x27;s NY.  </li>
            <li>Have seen many raves on this product online, and am a beauty product fanatic and willing to give most a try.  </li>
            <li>Nice oil but not worth the price.</li>
            <li>I tried a dime-sized sample of it and had to scrub all the oil off 10 minutes later because the smell was so strong.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth trying, however, I personally, would probably not buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This oil is good but not great.  </li>
            <li>Not heavy and does not clog my pores!</li>
            <li>I wish the bottle was not breakable because I keep it a nearly completely tiled bathroom.</li>
            <li>but this natural oil has evened out my skin tones and makes my face smoother.  </li>
            <li>And my skin which is can be sensitive</li>
            <li>I am 56 years old man, and started to use this product 2 months ago along with my regular lotions.</li>
            <li>I tend to get dry patches and this completely takes care of that problem.</li>

            <li> Goes a long way.</li>
            <li> aromatic blend of eleven essential oils is derived from flowers and other botanicals-every one of them known for their skin-soothing, softening and glow-giving properties.</li>
            <li> this is an extremely overpowering, nothing to write home about, body oil in a pretty bottle with a ridiculous price tag.</li>
            <li> no thanks.</li>
            <li> The smell reminds me of the senior center room at my job!</li>
            <li> Not worth buying</li>
            <li> Yes, this is very expensive, but it&#x27;s the only thing that works for me in the dry winter months.</li>
            <li> Not sure how it does it</li>
            <li> I have hooked on body oils lately and this is one of the ones I just got.</li>
            <li> $25 an ounce for plant oils that aren&#x27;t even organic and not spectacularly moisturizing in the least?</li>
            <li> IT REALLY SMELLS AWFUL</li>
            <li> and I am so addicted to it...</li>
            <li> AS EXPENSIVE AS IT WAS, I THREW IT IN THE GARBAGE.</li>
            <li> I agree with one of the previous reviews - the smell of the product is horrible.</li>
            <li> THAT&#x27;S HOW BAD  </li>
            <li> Too bad!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even use it it smells too awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this oil does everything it claims and you will get many compliments when you use it!!</li>
            <li> THIS IS WHAT THE DESCRIPTION SAYS:  \\&quot;an aromatic blend of eleven essential oils is derived from flowers and other botanicals-every one of them known for their skin-soothing, softening and glow-giving properties. Blended together, they leave the skin looking and feeling instantly supple, radiant and hydrated. RODIN olio lusso is more than a liquid moisturizer. It is a skin scent that is chemical free, and makes your skin the best it can be naturally.\\&quot;  YES, THIS PRODUCT DOES LEAVE YOUR SKIN LOOKING AND FEELING SUPPLE, RADIANT AND HYDRATED AND IT&#x27;S ALSO CHEMICAL FREE WHICH IS A BIG PLUS......BUT, AROMATIC?....IT REALLY SMELLS AWFUL AND THAT&#x27;S WHY I ONLY GAVE IT 3 STARS. I  DON&#x27;T FEEL COMFORTABLE WEARING IT OUT, SO I ONLY USE IT AT BEDTIME. HOPEFULLY RODIN CAN IMPROVE OF THE SMELL.  UPDATE......AS EXPENSIVE AS IT WAS, I THREW IT IN THE GARBAGE. THAT&#x27;S HOW BAD  THE SMELL IS. IF I COULD, I WOULDN&#x27;T EVEN GIVE THIS PRODUCT 1 STAR, BUT AMAZON DOESN&#x27;T GIVE THAT OPTION.</li>
            <li> You must love jasmin as it is the main smell and quite strong.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing packaging for shipping&lt;br /&gt;Well Done!!</li>
            <li> This oil is truly luxury 100% natural and effective&lt;br /&gt;Very good for firming the skin&lt;br /&gt;Also vey good for senitive and tight skin just eases and comforts the skin&lt;br /&gt;This oil is unique</li>
            <li> I have hooked on body oils lately and this is one of the ones I just got. I&#x27;m not a fan. It absorbs nicely  but I can&#x27;t get over the smell. The smell reminds me of the senior center room at my job! I will stick to my Moroccan oil, diptyque oil, and l&#x27;occitane.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of aromatic oils like jasmine and neroli and thought i would love this. the verdict? this is an extremely overpowering, nothing to write home about, body oil in a pretty bottle with a ridiculous price tag. $25 an ounce for plant oils that aren&#x27;t even organic and not spectacularly moisturizing in the least? no thanks.</li>
            <li> Only reason I gave it only 4 stars is that the bottle is glass. I wish the bottle was not breakable because I keep it a nearly completely tiled bathroom. Would keep it in the shower but can&#x27;t for reasons of safety. Perhaps the product, which I love, would chemically react with plastic and can&#x27;t be in that kind of container. Too bad!</li>
            <li> Not sure how it does it but this natural oil has evened out my skin tones and makes my face smoother.  I, at the advice of a friend, purchased the body oil for my face because it was cheaper and was made up of the same ingredients as the face oil. Not heavy and does not clog my pores!</li>
            <li> It smells like rotten olive oil. I can&#x27;t even use it it smells too awful. Try Argan oil instead. Not worth buying</li>
            <li> Great product. Goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love this product - I wear it instead of perfume</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple years now and I too use the body oil on my face.  I love this stuff.  It has a distinct smell, which really reminds me of a tropical flower.  The smell fades quickly and the oil is absorbed into your face immediately leaving skin smooth and supple.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I should have read ALL the reviews before ordering.  I had read a lot about the product in fashion magazines, so I thought I would treat myself.  Does not smell good!  Will not order again.</li>
            <li> the oil soaks into the skin and feels light- not greasy.</li>
            <li> Yes, this is very expensive, but it&#x27;s the only thing that works for me in the dry winter months. I tend to get dry patches and this completely takes care of that problem. I do use it over a moisturizer. And my skin which is can be sensitive did NOT break out when using this product. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great Product. Works great on older men&#x27;s face. I am 56 years old man, and started to use this product 2 months ago along with my regular lotions. my face skin is softer and feels great.</li>
            <li> This body oil smells amazing and I am so addicted to it...the only problem is that I will have to get a second job to afford to continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Have seen many raves on this product online, and am a beauty product fanatic and willing to give most a try.  This oil is good but not great.  Good for massaging your skin to increase circulation, however, not what I expected, considering all of the positive press it gets, particularly at Barney&#x27;s NY.  Fragrance of the oil was ok but not impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a body oil fan I think it&#x27;s worth trying, however, I personally, would probably not buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At a comparable price, I would buy a great body lotion like Aesop.</li>
            <li> Nice oil but not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I agree with one of the previous reviews - the smell of the product is horrible. I tried a dime-sized sample of it and had to scrub all the oil off 10 minutes later because the smell was so strong. Will be returning product.</li>
