            <li>I love this stuff</li>

            <li>I love the size of the products also.  </li>

            <li>i love this shampoo and conditoner set and the the size it came in.  </li>
            <li>, I like the Color Care better.</li>
            <li>effect.\\&quot; I periodically have the Brazilian Blowout done on my hair and the thing I love about this Shampoo &amp; Conditioner</li>
            <li>The salon specialist told me one of the most important things when having Keratin treatment is the follow up.  </li>
            <li>Love paraben free, chloride free hair products.</li>
            <li>My wife and I use the same shampoo and conditioner, so getting it at the salon can be pretty pricey, this is a nice alternative that saves a good chunk of change!</li>
            <li>Just love my Beautiful hair once it&#x27;s wash and dry with this product.</li>
            <li>This product is great and it leaves my hair soft and full of shine.  </li>
            <li>will be a loyal customer for years to come  :-)</li>
            <li>This was recommended to me by one of my hair care friends and is a great product, especially this type that&#x27;s sulfate free.</li>
            <li>As always everything went smoothly</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is not sulfate free.  </li>
            <li>I needed both to be sulfate free to preserve my keratin treatment, which is now falling apart.  </li>
            <li>Hair even feels great after flat ironing.</li>
            <li>I would rather go with original brand of Coppola Keratin</li>
            <li>The shampoo and the conditioner is not the original one we get from Copolla.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s make your hair healthy, shiny, smooth and keeps the frizz out even on real humid</li>
            <li>Coppola products works great for dry frizzy hair that has been treated with keratin process-</li>
            <li>Loved the product so much bought the whole line.</li>
            <li>My wife went to beauty salon on board a cruise ship recently and the stylist used it on her hair and she loved it.  </li>
            <li>Its always nice to find a good price when needed in hard times.</li>
            <li>shipped quick too</li>
            <li>Very smooth and soft for the hair treated with keratin</li>
            <li>my hair very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It is worth the money.</li>
            <li>My hair is more manageable, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really been able to see much of a difference using it compared to cheaper stuff.  </li>
            <li>check you get the right stuff.</li>
            <li>best shampoo left over these my hair feeling very soft and actually makes straighter</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the original product for the last 1+ year and could easily identify the difference in consistency and texture of the product.</li>
            <li>This product was exactly what I&#x27;ve purchased in salons.</li>
            <li>If you shake the bottles from time to time, the consistency is exactly as it should be.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The first time i used this i have a feelings its not gonna work on my hair .</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>buy the large bottles with a pump, it&#x27;s a MUCH better deal than the smaller bottles.</li>
            <li>The stuff leaves my hair dry and frizzy as against the original stuff which leaves your hair feeling smooth and</li>
            <li>This is a good value for colour-safe shampoo and conditioner that is much more expensive when purchased in the store or at the salon.</li>
            <li>I had first purchased this product from Ulta a few months ago and was very pleased.</li>
            <li>The Keratin Complex line of products have helped my gray, overprocessed hair feel and look healthy more than others I have used.</li>
            <li>Although they are very large bottles, the packaging is elegant - white with soft lettering that does not &#x27;scream&#x27; at you!</li>
            <li>As some other reviewers have noted - the item received is NOT sulfate free as it is Keratin care and not Keratin COLOR CARE which is in fact sulfate free.</li>
            <li>I thought I was smart to save the money.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different products, but this leaves my hair feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>Just be careful, the shampoo is thinner than others and its easy to use more than necessary.</li>
            <li>I really should have read all of the reviews</li>
            <li>Too much of a hassle to return.  </li>
            <li>It seems to really enhance their smoothing system that I use about every 4 months.</li>
            <li>It will be awhile till I buy again because of how much product is in the bottle.</li>
            <li>As it is a low/no sodium shampoo, my hair stays straight and the color doesn&#x27;t get stripped.</li>
            <li>this isn&#x27;t the real Coppola shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found the real deal for this price on amazon before so this is a ripoff in terms of price</li>
            <li>I had been using these products from my salon and found these to be much cheaper in the bulk and combined packaging.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it shipped fast</li>
            <li>i have tried a ton of other brazilian blowout shampoos and conditioners, and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m really hoping this is an issue with just my ability to watch the video, but if not I&#x27;ll rerecord and post a new one.</li>
            <li>These products really work to restore the moisture and smoothing qualities I need because of the heat and humidity conditions I live in.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased to find that Amazon was selling this for nearly half the cost!!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The conditioner was okay, but it was a little watery.</li>
            <li>treatment.&lt;br /&gt;The products keep my hair straight, shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>and it is completely stripped out of my hair thanks to this shampoo.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;It is used in concrete floor cleaners, engine degreasers, car wash detergents, and just about every soap and shampoo on the market.</li>
            <li>I did not believe it because I previously bought this product and read reviews and mine was fine.</li>
            <li>In the initial search i looked for coppola products, somehow i ended up with another brand of shampoo, but coppola conditioner, at the end they both work pretty well.</li>
            <li>I like it better because this shampoo does NOT contain sulfate like the other product and in case you don&#x27;t know what that means here is a short explanation.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love the Keratin Complex Color Care shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that I highlight.  </li>
            <li>Makes hair controllable, soft, shiny, Also controls frizz.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner make my hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair silky and soft.</li>
            <li>I was getting them at Target for almost the same price as Amazon, but I getting almost 3 times as much product on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>I didnt expect anything different from the product it was straight forward.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if one has old packaging or</li>
            <li>Makes it easier to blow dry straight and leaves my hair soft and well conditioned.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo I received was watered down and most definitely NOT the real product (which I have used previously).  </li>
            <li>I opened this particular fresh bottle a few weeks ago (having bought it a few months ago) and noticed right away from the scent and the way it washed the formula was different.</li>
            <li>I have using this product for a while, since i started getting keratin treatments, compare to other coppola shampoo and conditioners this one leaves my hair very shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>These shampoo &amp; conditioner are what is recommended to people with Keratin Treated hair, however, my hair looks clean only for a few hours &amp; after that, it looks &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I have very thick and a lot of hair and this makes my hair soft and smooth....</li>
            <li>and this was very watered down.  </li>
            <li>Product that I received was very watered down like it was cut with quite a bit of water.</li>

            <li> I had been using these products from my salon and found these to be much cheaper in the bulk and combined packaging.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it shipped fast</li>
            <li> i have tried a ton of other brazilian blowout shampoos and conditioners, and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m really hoping this is an issue with just my ability to watch the video, but if not I&#x27;ll rerecord and post a new one.</li>
            <li> These products really work to restore the moisture and smoothing qualities I need because of the heat and humidity conditions I live in.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to find that Amazon was selling this for nearly half the cost!!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The conditioner was okay, but it was a little watery.</li>
            <li> treatment.&lt;br /&gt;The products keep my hair straight, shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> and it is completely stripped out of my hair thanks to this shampoo.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;It is used in concrete floor cleaners, engine degreasers, car wash detergents, and just about every soap and shampoo on the market.</li>
            <li> I did not believe it because I previously bought this product and read reviews and mine was fine.</li>
            <li> In the initial search i looked for coppola products, somehow i ended up with another brand of shampoo, but coppola conditioner, at the end they both work pretty well.</li>
            <li> I like it better because this shampoo does NOT contain sulfate like the other product and in case you don&#x27;t know what that means here is a short explanation.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the Keratin Complex Color Care shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that I highlight.  </li>
            <li> Makes hair controllable, soft, shiny, Also controls frizz.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner make my hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair silky and soft.</li>
            <li> I was getting them at Target for almost the same price as Amazon, but I getting almost 3 times as much product on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I didnt expect anything different from the product it was straight forward.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know if one has old packaging or</li>
            <li> Makes it easier to blow dry straight and leaves my hair soft and well conditioned.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo I received was watered down and most definitely NOT the real product (which I have used previously).  </li>
            <li> I opened this particular fresh bottle a few weeks ago (having bought it a few months ago) and noticed right away from the scent and the way it washed the formula was different.</li>
            <li> I have using this product for a while, since i started getting keratin treatments, compare to other coppola shampoo and conditioners this one leaves my hair very shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> These shampoo &amp; conditioner are what is recommended to people with Keratin Treated hair, however, my hair looks clean only for a few hours &amp; after that, it looks &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have very thick and a lot of hair and this makes my hair soft and smooth....</li>
            <li> and this was very watered down.  </li>
            <li> Product that I received was very watered down like it was cut with quite a bit of water.</li>
            <li> It smelled the same and was just as thick as the first bottles I had purchased.</li>
            <li> It preserved my color about twice as long as regular shampoos.  </li>
            <li> my hair is coarse and I have a lot of it and is long too!</li>
            <li> The consistency is much thinner and it leaves the hair dull and lifeless.  </li>
            <li> All in all the price is expensive for as much as I use (my hair is EXTREMELY thick and almost down to my waist); however, I feel for my particular circumstances it is well worth it to prolong the pricey Blowout treatments and the reduction of hair breakage</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying my keratin complex from the salon and spending way too much.</li>
            <li> I really like Keratin Complex products.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo left my hair dryer and harder than before I used it.</li>
            <li> Kinda strange.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner are expensive, but I only need one pump of each to wash and condition my hair, which is medium-long length, and the first set I bought of the big bottles lasted me over five months, and I wash my hair every day.</li>
            <li> Also, one bottle looks different than the other</li>
            <li> Its making my hair dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> My hair is softer, smoother, easier to dry and style, and the split ends are dramatically improved, allowing me to grow my hair longer than I used to.</li>
            <li> Not only that this shampoo is harsh and has irritated my scalp and dried my hair out worse than cheap drugstore shampoo.</li>
            <li> Since shampoo is thinner than my previous purchases, I end up using almost double the quantity.</li>
            <li> Yes, for some brands the shampoo has been a little thinner than regular shampoo, but never have they had the consistency of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The conditioner is so thin and did absolutely nothing for my hair- didn&#x27;t take out one knot that its shampoo caused, and didn&#x27;t it leave my hair feeling like any conditioner had ever been in it after washing it out.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is really thin and the conditioner goes so fast .</li>
            <li> The same thing happened to my husband for his order also a few months ago.</li>
            <li> I got a Coppola keratin treatment a few months back, and have been using their shampoo, conditioner, and infusion keratin replenisher.</li>
            <li> I expected two Coppola brand Keratin products as pictures and desired...</li>
            <li> one of the pumps broke during shipping and leaked some shampoo (not much)</li>
            <li> The shampoo made my hair very dry and extremely knotty.</li>
            <li> I was a little weary after reading some reviews that the product people received was watered down or not the same quality, but after comparing it to what I purchased at Ulta, I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference.</li>
            <li> Other reviews complain that the product was &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; but I think this was because the product settled during shipping.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I used this like every other day.</li>
            <li> I never had this issue before with any other shampoos &amp; conditioners.</li>
            <li> They have helped the initial, expensive keratin treatment last a long time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t color my hair but after using this product and the regular Keratin Coppola Complex Care Shampoo &amp; Conditioner 33.8 oz.</li>
            <li> while the conditioner does smells good, the shampoo smells awful, something akin to the medicated dandruff shampoo my coworker</li>
            <li> but the last time I purchased the shampoo it wasn&#x27;t as thick as the shampoo I just received.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;BOTH my shampoo and conditioner were watered down, the shampoo to the point of outright insult to me as the buyer.</li>
            <li> The shampoo was watered down.  </li>
            <li> This is watered down.</li>
            <li> currently using loreal color care for the mean time .</li>
            <li> The product arrived in less than a week, as promised.</li>
            <li> I have previously used this on my hair ad</li>
            <li> My hair is long thick curly .</li>
            <li> I have used these products for years but now sadly must find new products.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for a few years and it previously worked wonders maintaining my treatment.</li>
            <li> Wish it was a little thicker in consistency.</li>
            <li> A little annoyed I didn&#x27;t know the bottles were different before they arrived...</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have blonde thin hair..</li>
            <li> I would waste your money...</li>
            <li> I just wasted $60.00 dollars on this product...</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your time &amp; money on this product....</li>
            <li> was very little lather.  </li>
            <li> The label (with exception of the small print) is otherwise identical.</li>
            <li> Does the job of cleaning my hair and maintains my very expensive salon keratin treatment for over 3 months so far.  </li>
            <li> I feel that after I used this - my hair felt hard and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> but still my hair is still frizzy , lots of tangle hair , and its hard to comb my hair .</li>
            <li> The hair stylist recommended Keratin Complex to sustain the straightening</li>
            <li> I have been using Keratin complex  shampoo for 3-4 years.</li>
            <li> I used to bleach my hair, so it was damaged to say the least.</li>
            <li> the product sucks....</li>
            <li> Also Keratin S&amp;C is so much healthier than other S&amp;C like Pantene for example (don&#x27;t get my hairdresser started on how horrible Pantene is for your hair).</li>
            <li> After having a brazilian blowout, I was looking for a less expensive option to the brazilian blowout brand name shampoo and conditiner.</li>
            <li> Given I do have thick, semi-course hair, but this is by far the worst shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used for my keratin and color treated hair, and I&#x27;ve tried loads of &#x27;em.</li>
            <li> I had to run to the store to buy L&#x27;Oreal to hold me over for the remaining 6 days- not happy about that.</li>
            <li> I think it is a poor knock off.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing this product for years and suddenly my expensive shampoo bottle comes in completely watery and disgusting.</li>
            <li> So sad</li>
            <li> 6 weeks into my expensive blowout treatment</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> (75% reduction from when I was using Pantene, again my hairdresser was mad at me)!</li>
            <li> I hate it.....</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This was recommended to me by one of my hair care friends and is a great product, especially this type that&#x27;s sulfate free.</li>
            <li> The products are now watery and do not work on my hair the same as they use to.  Time to change. I have used these products for years but now sadly must find new products.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I&#x27;ve purchased in salons. Other reviews complain that the product was &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; but I think this was because the product settled during shipping. If you shake the bottles from time to time, the consistency is exactly as it should be.&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally curly, highlighted hair that I straighten and the Coppola products work great for me!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the Keratin Complex Color Care shampoo and conditioner.  I have naturally curly hair that I highlight.  I have tried many different products, but this leaves my hair feeling very soft. You don&#x27;t have to use a lot....a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Best Shampoo and Conditioner ever. It&#x27;s make your hair healthy, shiny, smooth and keeps the frizz out even on real humid days.&lt;br /&gt;I will be a loyal customer for years to come  :-)</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo and conditioner and really love the price! I&#x27;ve been buying my keratin complex from the salon and spending way too much. Since I have a keratin treatment I have to use this shampoo and conditioner so saving money makes me happy!</li>
            <li> Love paraben free, chloride free hair products.</li>
            <li> The shampoo &amp; conditioner was great quality, smell is Okay but it gets the job done. The shipping took 9 days!! If I could go back I&#x27;d order from another store/company because I had just gotten my hair treated and &#x27;assumed&#x27; the three days i needed to wait to wash my hair would have been enough time to receive it-wrong. I had to run to the store to buy L&#x27;Oreal to hold me over for the remaining 6 days- not happy about that.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1964QQHC474R4]]I bought ahead of time in preparation for getting a keratin treatment done to my hair, well I finally got the keratin treatment done and started using the shampoo and condition. I really should have read all of the reviews first!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTH my shampoo and conditioner were watered down, the shampoo to the point of outright insult to me as the buyer. I&#x27;ve purchased similar products from my hairdresser and have never had the shampoo and conditioner be so watery. Yes, for some brands the shampoo has been a little thinner than regular shampoo, but never have they had the consistency of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also while the conditioner does smells good, the shampoo smells awful, something akin to the medicated dandruff shampoo my coworker uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as an fyi, the bottles I received looked different from the picture shown and each bottle included a pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I found out after the fact (no one to blame but myself on this) that this shampoo SHOULD NOT BE USED if you have a brazillian blow out or keratin treatment done to you hair as it contains sulfate which strips the treatment out of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Edited to include a video*&lt;br /&gt;Sorry that my video is horizontal instead of vertical, I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to fix it. Additionally on my computer the video froze and jumped, I&#x27;m really hoping this is an issue with just my ability to watch the video, but if not I&#x27;ll rerecord and post a new one.</li>
            <li> I love keratin shampoo/conditioner but this brand is like water.  Wouldn&#x27;t reorder and will be glad when it&#x27;s gone.  Too much of a hassle to return.  Glad I didn&#x27;t give as a gift!</li>
            <li> I had my hair straightened on a recent cruise. The hair stylist recommended Keratin Complex to sustain the straightening treatment.&lt;br /&gt;The products keep my hair straight, shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I have been using Keratin complex  shampoo for 3-4 years. I bought this as price was good . Since shampoo is thinner than my previous purchases, I end up using almost double the quantity. I would rather go with original brand of Coppola Keratin</li>
            <li> Based on read reviews and based on friend&#x27;s recommendations I was expecting this shampoo and conditioner duo to stop my problem with frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;I do not see any improvements.</li>
            <li> Definitely NOT the same shampoo I bought at the salon! I will not take that chance by buying online anymore. I thought I was smart to save the money. Learned my lesson!</li>
            <li> I have very thick and a lot of hair and this makes my hair soft and smooth....I am Hispanic/Italian so I don&#x27;t have blonde thin hair..my hair is coarse and I have a lot of it and is long too! I really love this!</li>
            <li> The shampoo left my hair dryer and harder than before I used it. The conditioner was okay, but it was a little watery. I think the company who sold it to me dilluted it. I will never buy thi item again because I paid a lot of money (over $60) for both and got the same results I could have gotten with any shampoo at publix that costs $3.00.</li>
            <li> This was supposed to be the same product I purchased from my hair salon but it doesn&#x27;t work the same.  The consistency is much thinner and it leaves the hair dull and lifeless.  I would never order this again.  I think it is a poor knock off.</li>
            <li> The shampoo made my hair very dry and extremely knotty. The conditioner is so thin and did absolutely nothing for my hair- didn&#x27;t take out one knot that its shampoo caused, and didn&#x27;t it leave my hair feeling like any conditioner had ever been in it after washing it out. Given I do have thick, semi-course hair, but this is by far the worst shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used for my keratin and color treated hair, and I&#x27;ve tried loads of &#x27;em.</li>
            <li> best shampoo left over these my hair feeling very soft and actually makes straighter I love this stuff keep on using this product</li>
            <li> I really like Keratin Complex products.  It seems to really enhance their smoothing system that I use about every 4 months.</li>
            <li> My wife went to beauty salon on board a cruise ship recently and the stylist used it on her hair and she loved it.  So when we got home she wanted to buy the products in a larger size.  she says her hair feels great, is easy to style, and really has a nice shine.  She loves the product very much!!!</li>
            <li> Bottles seemed official and is working great. My keratin treatment is still going. It will be awhile till I buy again because of how much product is in the bottle.</li>
            <li> This is a good value for colour-safe shampoo and conditioner that is much more expensive when purchased in the store or at the salon.</li>
            <li> The shampoo was watered down.  I have purchased this item from Amazon for two years and it has always been a&lt;br /&gt;creamy mixture and this was very watered down.  I couldn&#x27;t even keep enough on my hand to put on my head and&lt;br /&gt;there was very little lather.  Very disappointed.  Will not order from this vendor.  And I bought two bottles - what a waste&lt;br /&gt;of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Keratin Color Shampoo &amp; Conditioner for years. I&#x27;ve never found anything that works so well. My hair maintains a great color between appointments and it&#x27;s healthy and feels great.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have a keratin treatment - you will like this.  If you do, you will notice that it does nothing to prolong your treatment life.  I feel that after I used this - my hair felt hard and frizzy.  I changed brands and poof - problem gone.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo and conditioner because this product is what was used on my hair after my Keratin treatment on a cruise ship.  The salon specialist told me one of the most important things when having Keratin treatment is the follow up.  This product works well and I feel has extended the Keratin treatment quite a bit.  I will buy again!</li>
            <li> Tried it out on a vacation trip at a salon. I now use it in my salon. Makes hair controllable, soft, shiny, Also controls frizz. Hair even feels great after flat ironing. Good price buying the pump sizes together. Loved the product so much bought the whole line.</li>
            <li> This is watered down. I did not believe it because I previously bought this product and read reviews and mine was fine. I rebought this and forget it. You&#x27;re better off buying from Harmons. No savings here.</li>
            <li> Very Happy with this product, second time ordering it.</li>
            <li> So i bought this at ulta for $20 each its not the 33 oz .  It&#x27;s the meduim size for $20 each ...  After i get my color treated hair and keratin treatment .  It was june when i start using this product .  The first time i used this i have a feelings its not gonna work on my hair . The shampoo is really thin and the conditioner goes so fast . I used this like every other day. My hair is long thick curly . I  put a lot of conditiner on my hair every time i wash it but still my hair is still frizzy , lots of tangle hair , and its hard to comb my hair . I like have to put lots of leave in spray on my hair to soften my hair .&lt;br /&gt;So the conditioner is gone and the shampoo is almost empty.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m currently using loreal color care for the mean time .</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this shampoo as I both color and straighten my hair.  As it is a low/no sodium shampoo, my hair stays straight and the color doesn&#x27;t get stripped.</li>
            <li> The shampoo I received was watered down and most definitely NOT the real product (which I have used previously).  Total fraud.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner and great value. Although they are very large bottles, the packaging is elegant - white with soft lettering that does not &#x27;scream&#x27; at you!</li>
            <li> My stylist started using these products on my hair after I started getting Keratin treatments.  They complement the treatment.  I love the way my hair feels and looks.</li>
            <li> It preserved my color about twice as long as regular shampoos.  It also extended the results of my keratin treatment.  It is worth the money.</li>
            <li> These products really work to restore the moisture and smoothing qualities I need because of the heat and humidity conditions I live in.</li>
            <li> I tried this when my friend had bought some after her stylist recommended it. I used to bleach my hair, so it was damaged to say the least. This stuff SAVED my hair. I don&#x27;t bleach it anymore, so I only use this stuff now intermittently because it is a bit pricey. However, if you have the budget I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> i have used this stuff for almost 2 years, i would not use anything else.  it was recommended to me on a carnival cruise and i love it</li>
            <li> These product are amazing</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing this product for years and suddenly my expensive shampoo bottle comes in completely watery and disgusting. Ugh. Never again.</li>
            <li> As always everything went smoothly</li>
            <li> Love it!  Great price, delivery and conformity. I will definitely buy from this seller again.  I have not found a shampoo and conditioner better than these to keep the frizzies out of my hair and maintain my color. Thank you!</li>
            <li> After having a brazilian blowout, I was looking for a less expensive option to the brazilian blowout brand name shampoo and conditiner. I had first purchased this product from Ulta a few months ago and was very pleased. Ulta charged $20 for each 13.5 oz. bottle. I was very pleased to find that Amazon was selling this for nearly half the cost!!! I was a little weary after reading some reviews that the product people received was watered down or not the same quality, but after comparing it to what I purchased at Ulta, I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference. It smelled the same and was just as thick as the first bottles I had purchased. Overall I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brand of shampoo and conditioner as I can&#x27;t seem to find it in the store BUT and received 2 shampoos!!!!  The same thing happened to my husband for his order also a few months ago. Now I have to go and order conditioner!!!!! check you get the right stuff.</li>
            <li> These shampoo &amp; conditioner are what is recommended to people with Keratin Treated hair, however, my hair looks clean only for a few hours &amp; after that, it looks &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;. I never had this issue before with any other shampoos &amp; conditioners.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner make my hair feel so soft. I would use it even if I didn&#x27;t have the keratin treatment.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery! Great product! Super sized items!!!! Coppola products works great for dry frizzy hair that has been treated with keratin process-</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo and conditioner because of the straightener I had put in my hair. This is a GREAT PRICE !! Will definitely be buying these sets again.</li>
            <li> As a keratin user, I have watched for this product, and was thrilled to see both a great price and a product manufacturer I know and trust.</li>
            <li> I love these products.  I have reordered over and over again.  Great for women who color their hair.  I love the size of the products also.  Great price too.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m not putting 1 star is that I blame myself for not noticing this isn&#x27;t the real Coppola shampoo and conditioner.  Its making my hair dry and frizzy.  So sad I didn;t notice.  I&#x27;ve found the real deal for this price on amazon before so this is a ripoff in terms of price</li>
            <li> The Keratin Complex line of products have helped my gray, overprocessed hair feel and look healthy more than others I have used. I got a Coppola keratin treatment a few months back, and have been using their shampoo, conditioner, and infusion keratin replenisher. They have helped the initial, expensive keratin treatment last a long time. The shampoo and conditioner are expensive, but I only need one pump of each to wash and condition my hair, which is medium-long length, and the first set I bought of the big bottles lasted me over five months, and I wash my hair every day. My hair is softer, smoother, easier to dry and style, and the split ends are dramatically improved, allowing me to grow my hair longer than I used to.</li>
            <li> I expected two Coppola brand Keratin products as pictures and desired...it was not. Arrived promptly though with a comparable price.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent, i will recommend to anyone who have keratin treatment, and colored.... is the perfect shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> In the initial search i looked for coppola products, somehow i ended up with another brand of shampoo, but coppola conditioner, at the end they both work pretty well. I can definitely see a difference in my hair now that i am using a keratin shampoo and cond. recommend it, but try to use same brand of product.</li>
            <li> My daughter introduced me to this product. It leaves my hair silky and soft. Just be careful, the shampoo is thinner than others and its easy to use more than necessary. I love the pumps. I was getting them at Target for almost the same price as Amazon, but I getting almost 3 times as much product on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is not sulfate free.  The shampoo is.  I needed both to be sulfate free to preserve my keratin treatment, which is now falling apart.  I don&#x27;t understand why both products aren&#x27;t from the same manufacturer.</li>
            <li> DO NOT buy this product especially if you&#x27;ve just paid $$$ for a blowout. I have used this shampoo for a few years and it previously worked wonders maintaining my treatment. I opened this particular fresh bottle a few weeks ago (having bought it a few months ago) and noticed right away from the scent and the way it washed the formula was different. 6 weeks into my expensive blowout treatment and it is completely stripped out of my hair thanks to this shampoo. Not only that this shampoo is harsh and has irritated my scalp and dried my hair out worse than cheap drugstore shampoo. I pulled the bottle today to figure out what was going on and compared the ingredients listed in this online description and they do not match the ingredients on the back of the bottle. The label (with exception of the small print) is otherwise identical. The ingredients were covered with a sku sticker that I had to peal back to even compare ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who knows what I&#x27;m actually getting. From the condition of my hair probably dish soap.</li>
            <li> Gives body while conditioning, and treating hair.  The bottles are huge and a really good value for sush a good product.</li>
            <li> great except one of the pumps broke during shipping and leaked some shampoo (not much) thankfully I have another pump laying around that I can use.</li>
            <li> The product description states that this set is \\&quot;sulfate free\\&quot; which is a must for keratin treated hair. As some other reviewers have noted - the item received is NOT sulfate free as it is Keratin care and not Keratin COLOR CARE which is in fact sulfate free. Do not ignore the reviews and rely on the description as I did - purchase keratin color care from another buyer.</li>
            <li> i have tried a ton of other brazilian blowout shampoos and conditioners, and this is my favorite. buy the large bottles with a pump, it&#x27;s a MUCH better deal than the smaller bottles.</li>
            <li> I only use Coppola keratin treatments and shampoo and conditioner.  This is a Must after treament to extend the life of it.</li>
            <li> Product received in a timely manner.  I didn&#x27;t realize it but the last time I purchased the shampoo it wasn&#x27;t as thick as the shampoo I just received.  I will definately purchase from the same company again.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and the conditioner is not the original one we get from Copolla.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the original product for the last 1+ year and could easily identify the difference in consistency and texture of the product. The stuff leaves my hair dry and frizzy as against the original stuff which leaves your hair feeling smooth and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do a favor to yourself and don&#x27;t purchase from this vendor.</li>
            <li> Product that I received was very watered down like it was cut with quite a bit of water. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Stay away.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and soft for the hair treated with keratin</li>
            <li> was on time. great. I didnt expect anything different from the product it was straight forward. I will be able to tell you more after a month of using it.</li>
            <li> I would waste your money...the product sucks....It made feel grease......I hate it.....I just wasted $60.00 dollars on this product...Please don&#x27;t waste your time &amp; money on this product....</li>
            <li> I had been using these products from my salon and found these to be much cheaper in the bulk and combined packaging.</li>
            <li> Love the product. Its always nice to find a good price when needed in hard times. Thank you and have a great holiday.</li>
            <li> Love this purchase and will more then gladly purchase again and again. Just love my Beautiful hair once it&#x27;s wash and dry with this product.</li>
            <li> My wife and I use the same shampoo and conditioner, so getting it at the salon can be pretty pricey, this is a nice alternative that saves a good chunk of change!</li>
            <li> I have using this product for a while, since i started getting keratin treatments, compare to other coppola shampoo and conditioners this one leaves my hair very shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Does the job of cleaning my hair and maintains my very expensive salon keratin treatment for over 3 months so far.  Wish it was a little thicker in consistency.</li>
            <li> This product is great and it leaves my hair soft and full of shine.  I have used this product for 3 years now and would never use anything else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a good shampoo and this one, as apposed to others, does everything it claims to do. My hair is more manageable, soft and shiny. I highly recommend it. You will not be disappointed. The product arrived in less than a week, as promised.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really been able to see much of a difference using it compared to cheaper stuff.  I have to put almost 2 handfuls of shampoo in my hair to get it to lather.  Also, one bottle looks different than the other so I don&#x27;t know if one has old packaging or if it from another country or what.  Kinda strange.</li>
            <li> A little annoyed I didn&#x27;t know the bottles were different before they arrived... The conditioner bottle got damaged in the shipment, so the pump never worked. Otherwise, it shipped fast</li>
            <li> They want a lot of money for what this does.  It&#x27;s necessary to use this if you have had a keratin treatment done.  It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Perfect product for people with hair extensions.</li>
            <li> elent price for superior product. if you have highlightsor color your hair, this is the product for you. there is no sense spending $200 to get your hair colored and then ruining it in a week.</li>
            <li> My mother told me about this product and let me use some of hers and I fell in love with it!&lt;br /&gt;Makes my hair very smooth and soft. Even though my hair isn&#x27;t colored it still works great! It also helps when straightening my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Love this product!</li>
            <li> i love this shampoo and conditoner set and the the size it came in.  I have previously used this on my hair ad the results are amazing.  shipped quick too</li>
            <li> Excellent shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner tames my frizzy tresses. Makes it easier to blow dry straight and leaves my hair soft and well conditioned.  Love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t color my hair but after using this product and the regular Keratin Coppola Complex Care Shampoo &amp; Conditioner 33.8 oz., I like the Color Care better. I like it better because this shampoo does NOT contain sulfate like the other product and in case you don&#x27;t know what that means here is a short explanation. \\&quot;It is used in concrete floor cleaners, engine degreasers, car wash detergents, and just about every soap and shampoo on the market. In the same way as it dissolves the grease on car engines, sodium lauryl sulfate also dissolves the oils on your skin, which can cause a drying effect.\\&quot; I periodically have the Brazilian Blowout done on my hair and the thing I love about this Shampoo &amp; Conditioner is it prolongs the treatment and helps it last longer. Also Keratin S&amp;C is so much healthier than other S&amp;C like Pantene for example (don&#x27;t get my hairdresser started on how horrible Pantene is for your hair). All in all the price is expensive for as much as I use (my hair is EXTREMELY thick and almost down to my waist); however, I feel for my particular circumstances it is well worth it to prolong the pricey Blowout treatments and the reduction of hair breakage (75% reduction from when I was using Pantene, again my hairdresser was mad at me)!</li>
