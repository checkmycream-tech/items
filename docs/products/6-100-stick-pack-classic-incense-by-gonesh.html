            <li>The incense sticks don&#x27;t have that smoky smell while they are burning, just a nice bold perfume.</li>
            <li>Brings back many happy memories.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always enjoyed burning this Gonesh scent, but I go through a lot of incense quickly.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product.  </li>
            <li>Impressed with quick order fulfillment, and shipment to arrive in a few days.  </li>
            <li>The scent has been consistent for more than forty years.  </li>
            <li>This bulk pack was a good deal and should last me awhile.</li>
            <li>No surprises other than that this company is great all the time.</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>Nice to find it in such large quantities.</li>
            <li>To me, this incense brings back lovely memories...</li>
            <li>I am  surprised its still available.</li>
            <li>Just opening a few packs and placing around the house makes it smell good for weeks without even lighting them.</li>
            <li>This has been a favorite of mine for a long time.</li>

            <li>This is high quality incense,delivered at a reasonable price,thanks to my prime membership.</li>
            <li>This gives me plenty of high quality incense at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this particular product and scent.</li>
            <li>The sticks are rich with aroma and last quite long.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s charcoal-based (vs. most other incense, which I think is sandalwood-based?), so smoke is as minimal as you can expect, and you don&#x27;t smell the smoke of the material burning at all, just the intended scents being released.  </li>
            <li>100 sticks of common incense the same brand but different type that I buy in the Groceries store am satisfied with this product</li>
