            <li>good luck with that.</li>

            <li>If you want a good trimmer, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sorta ok for nose/ear hair, but nothing great.</li>

            <li>will keep you groomed easily and without a lot of hassle then this works great.</li>
            <li>Buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li>used the switchblade just to do trimming on my face and chest, and to be honest with you</li>
            <li>/&gt;attachments are nice</li>
            <li>&#x27;s be honest, I probably wouldn&#x27;t use this to shave anyone&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>I honestly could not have gotten a nastier cut if I had gone at the thumb with a straight-edge razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>It is great for those straggler hairs, and when you need a quick fix.</li>
            <li>As advertized great product and fast shipping</li>
            <li>Thought it would be a better product</li>
            <li>;, but it was something better than this.</li>
            <li>together if someone else is helping you its ok.</li>
            <li>guarantee l wasn&#x27;t able to use it because it doesn&#x27;t work and a got an email that l can&#x27;t return the product that&#x27;s a rip off.</li>
            <li>love the grooming kit that came with this.  </li>
            <li>A person can never have too many sets of clippers, too many combs, too many lint brushes.  </li>
            <li>This kit will be tossed into the suitcase for the many road trips we take.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this product in order to put it to the test so that I could give it an honest review.</li>
            <li>OK...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting better at using it.</li>
            <li>Works okay.</li>
            <li>The light is a nice bonus</li>
            <li>Better than going to a barber.</li>
            <li>This product without a doubt, is the consummate cheap Chinese junk.</li>
            <li>But if you want a cheap trimmer, there are better options.  </li>
            <li>quality was also fine</li>
            <li>/&gt;The trimmer comes with batteries and it can take off fine sparse hair.</li>
            <li>Be lucky if it lasts 5 more minutes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The comb attachments are not as effective as the large trimmer head that is built into the handle.</li>
            <li>its so cheaply made that when u try to use the body trimmer end the sliding guard has to click it on and you can&#x27;t get the height comb to stay on.</li>
            <li>ok, now the micro end has a litght to see what your trimming, except it was not cutting any hair or snag at it ...</li>
            <li>The trimmer portion works if you are only wanting to trim off fly away hair using the trimmer brush to keep things even.  </li>
            <li>And the trimmer and all its accessories fit inside the leather-like case.  </li>
            <li>do have to admit that I did receive this product free in exchange for a review.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Yes, this is cheaply made, but it&#x27;s also cheaply priced.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap plastic</li>
            <li>/&gt;*I received a free sample for review from the distributor.</li>
            <li>-&lt;br /&gt;It is important to hold the blade correctly for it to cut correctly.&lt;br /&gt;Mine</li>
            <li>Cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap.  </li>
            <li>My trimmer came with the trimmer but a nice travel set complete with a shoe horn, fingernail clippers, file and more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although the toothbrush is probably not one I would normally use, it would be handy in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I thought I&#x27;d see of the maker had taken any of the criticism from the original design and improve on it.  </li>
            <li>Also hair is a pain to clean from blade.</li>
            <li>Mine did come not just with the trimmer but a nice travel set complete with a shoe horn, toothbrush, fingernail clippers, file and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mine included a complete and handy grooming set.</li>
            <li>You might be able to cut your front top and sides, but help is needed for the back.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s for quick jobs and for that it works</li>
            <li>the seller sent this very fast!</li>
            <li>After a few trials I managed to hold it at the required 45 degree angle and it worked beautifully.</li>
            <li>This is great for camping, or even if you need to do a little touch up on the go.  </li>
            <li>I was offered the Microtouch switchblade set in exchange for a review, and I have to say that the following is my honest opinion about the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A distinct stubble still remains after using the shaving head.</li>
            <li>Drains fresh batteries within 7-8 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I was offered the Microtouch switchblade set in exchange for a review, and the following is my honest opinion about this</li>
            <li>it was most upsetting and it now looking to replace it with sometime more highly reviewed and itn the same price range....</li>
            <li>Right out of the box after insertion of the batteries it turns on.</li>
            <li>This design makes it much easier to tidy up the back of my neck and hairline.  </li>
            <li>the micro trimmer went out within the first two weeks.</li>
            <li>Better off buying a grooming kit at your local farm supply store.</li>
            <li>l wasn&#x27;t able to use it because it was not the same as shown in the TV ads that will cut your hair by just combing.  </li>
            <li>He is 78 and he said he would have to read the instructions first.</li>
            <li>My first trim came out looking like I used a Veg-O-Matic</li>
            <li>Received the first one which did not work after one use.</li>
            <li>But, for quick touch-ups and an emergency, it works even better than I expected.</li>
            <li>The trimmer itself with its accessories on the other side of the box nicely arranged so they donâ€™t break.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is absolutely a piece of garbage that will break within your first 5 uses.</li>
            <li>It takes the place of several other trimming devices and is also great to have in your grab &amp; go bag.  </li>
            <li>I put fresh new aaa batteries in it twice.</li>
            <li>the trimmer part is small and great for those places near your ears because it wont cut you</li>
            <li>nail trimmers (one large, one</li>
            <li>The problems is that guard opens and closes by a sliding motion and locks when it get to the end -- because the &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; on the top is very smooth and locking mechanism sticks quite a bit (at least with the item I got), the impulse is to place your thumb at the top and push down.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer cuts pretty ok, not as well as a razor, but it will clear off the big stuff without harming the skin.  </li>
            <li>decent value, Thanks!</li>
            <li>This little gadget is amazing for removing unwanted body hair.</li>
            <li>have given 5 stars except the carrying case is really flimsy.</li>
            <li>Cheap CHINESE junk!!!</li>
            <li>Thanks everyone.</li>
            <li>All it really does is just pull your hair.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work well.</li>
            <li>Following it up with a razor will be needed of you want smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>Maybe my guard is just extra sticky, but I was surprised that there weren&#x27;t more complaints of this nature here.  </li>
            <li>The plastic guards do work, but there is no indication of just how close these are going to cut, which many other trimmers offer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The thing is, this could have been easily avoided by adding a small curve or guard at the end, by nesting the blade element lower down, relative to the guard, or just constructing the guard more competently, such that the locking and unlocking occur more smoothly.</li>
            <li>A case in point: I nearly wrote this off as junk at first because it did not remove a single fine neck hair.</li>
            <li>Better half uses it to keep his moustache and sideburns trimmed - I use it to remove the &#x27;devils bridge&#x27; eyebrow between my two brows.  </li>
            <li>Also, be careful because trimming your hair while looking in a mirror is not as easy as it seems.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In order to use this effectively you need to carefully follow the instructions, then become accustomed to the angle you need to hold it at for different trimming operations.</li>
            <li>I recently took a 10 day trip, and was amazed at how many of the items I had carried with me just to do the same thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seriously do not buy</li>
            <li>For a few dollars more, you can get a cordless trimmer that will hold a charge through the whole trim.</li>
            <li>I love the design having the blades parallel to the handle, instead of the traditional perpendicular orientation.  </li>
            <li>This is particularly an issue if you want to trim your hair as shown in the picture.  </li>
            <li>While it worked, it was decent, it did the job.  </li>
            <li>So I can say that it trims some hair but don&#x27;t count on it to be as strong as other battery powered</li>
            <li>cheaply made&lt;br /&gt;cutting power is minimal</li>
            <li>It would have been nice had the cost of including the grooming kit been used to improve the quality of the trimmer, but I do want to emphasize that it (the trimmer) does work if properly used and will last if you care for it properly.</li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t the quality batteries I normally use.</li>
            <li>Regardless, this is an obvious design flaw (putting your fingers right in line with the blades during the sliding motion that expose them).  </li>
            <li>Feels a little flimsy in the hand compared to the better known brands but no issues so far.  </li>
            <li>Replaced bradn new batteries, but no luck.</li>
            <li>it may turn out that i love it if the replacement actually works longer than the first i just got it and havent even put batteries in it yet and the first one was defective as in many cases was proly just my turn to get the one bad one  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The trimmer feels good in the hand, not too big and clumsy.</li>
            <li>I used it for the back of my neck and sides of my head and found that I can alternate haircuts, it makes you look clean and professional, get this one guys!!</li>
            <li>Other than that, it was a enjoyable product to use, and I will definitely be telling others about it.</li>
            <li>When I bought I didn&#x60;t know well how it worked and when I slided it for the first time i cut my finger real deep!</li>
            <li>In the future, I am sure I will try it in other areas and see how it does, but for now I am rather content with it.  </li>
            <li>I hope that this indicates a better quality control from what appears to have been their past kits.</li>
            <li>The guard resists heavily at first and then gives way all at once, and because the blades rest in a groove inside the guard, the thumb (or other unlucky digit) gets dragged straight across them.  </li>
            <li>And Complete Junk.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Please do not waste your money on this piece of garbage.</li>
            <li>Get a plug-in trimmer or at least a better portable one.</li>
            <li>and we were both rather surprised at how well it did.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t really stay on properly.  </li>
            <li>Too much of a hassle to send back.  </li>
            <li>Never worked correctly, but it would have cost too much to send it back.</li>
            <li>But having looked at a number of customer reviews for products made by this company, and considering the state of their customer service, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this thing went through negligible safety testing.  </li>
            <li>Io ho piÃ¹ di novanta anni, quasi non cammino e non ho nessuno che vada a far la fila di ore</li>
            <li>I am a older female who bought this product for my nose and chin hair, uses that were advertised on TV.  </li>
            <li>It trims body hair, and with following directions and practice, you will see decent results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>WHAT I EXPECTED, I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND AS MY FIRST CHOICE.</li>
            <li>Bought new batteries and still not enough power.</li>
            <li>The device is a 2-in-1 broad trimmer and sculptor.  </li>
            <li>I hope that this indicates a better quality control from what appears to have been their past kits.&gt;I did not expect much after seeing all of the negative reviews, so I was pleasantly surprised with the kit that I received and how it tested out for me.</li>
            <li>However, with a little practice to get the angle right they will work as claimed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s difficult to keep all attachments together, especially if you travel.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, outstanding!</li>
            <li>It did have some issues when there was too much hair in the blade and the cover on the other end</li>
            <li>Even being extremely cognizant of the issue after the first major cut, I still found in some later uses that I couldn&#x27;t open the damn thing without getting</li>
            <li>They added new features, yes, but the overall design and construction remain the same second rate work.  </li>
            <li>not sharp enough will just pull the hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a gorilla but after 1 full body &amp;#34;trim&amp;#34;  the blades were dull.  </li>
            <li>It will do the job, but it takes time because the blades are not long and the blades are not the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it has no cutting power, however, it is a pretty useless device</li>
            <li>Use these in your travel kit (after learning to use them) for those emergency touch ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not expect much after seeing all of the negative reviews, so I was pleasantly surprised with the kit that I received and how it tested out for me.</li>

            <li> ok, now the micro end has a litght to see what your trimming, except it was not cutting any hair or snag at it ...</li>
            <li> The trimmer portion works if you are only wanting to trim off fly away hair using the trimmer brush to keep things even.  </li>
            <li> And the trimmer and all its accessories fit inside the leather-like case.  </li>
            <li> do have to admit that I did receive this product free in exchange for a review.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Yes, this is cheaply made, but it&#x27;s also cheaply priced.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap plastic</li>
            <li> /&gt;*I received a free sample for review from the distributor.</li>
            <li> -&lt;br /&gt;It is important to hold the blade correctly for it to cut correctly.&lt;br /&gt;Mine</li>
            <li> Cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheap.  </li>
            <li> My trimmer came with the trimmer but a nice travel set complete with a shoe horn, fingernail clippers, file and more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although the toothbrush is probably not one I would normally use, it would be handy in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I thought I&#x27;d see of the maker had taken any of the criticism from the original design and improve on it.  </li>
            <li> Also hair is a pain to clean from blade.</li>
            <li> Mine did come not just with the trimmer but a nice travel set complete with a shoe horn, toothbrush, fingernail clippers, file and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mine included a complete and handy grooming set.</li>
            <li> You might be able to cut your front top and sides, but help is needed for the back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s for quick jobs and for that it works</li>
            <li> the seller sent this very fast!</li>
            <li> After a few trials I managed to hold it at the required 45 degree angle and it worked beautifully.</li>
            <li> This is great for camping, or even if you need to do a little touch up on the go.  </li>
            <li> I was offered the Microtouch switchblade set in exchange for a review, and I have to say that the following is my honest opinion about the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A distinct stubble still remains after using the shaving head.</li>
            <li> Drains fresh batteries within 7-8 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I was offered the Microtouch switchblade set in exchange for a review, and the following is my honest opinion about this</li>
            <li> it was most upsetting and it now looking to replace it with sometime more highly reviewed and itn the same price range....</li>
            <li> Right out of the box after insertion of the batteries it turns on.</li>
            <li> This design makes it much easier to tidy up the back of my neck and hairline.  </li>
            <li> the micro trimmer went out within the first two weeks.</li>
            <li> Better off buying a grooming kit at your local farm supply store.</li>
            <li> l wasn&#x27;t able to use it because it was not the same as shown in the TV ads that will cut your hair by just combing.  </li>
            <li> He is 78 and he said he would have to read the instructions first.</li>
            <li> My first trim came out looking like I used a Veg-O-Matic</li>
            <li> Received the first one which did not work after one use.</li>
            <li> But, for quick touch-ups and an emergency, it works even better than I expected.</li>
            <li> The trimmer itself with its accessories on the other side of the box nicely arranged so they donâ€™t break.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is absolutely a piece of garbage that will break within your first 5 uses.</li>
            <li> It takes the place of several other trimming devices and is also great to have in your grab &amp; go bag.  </li>
            <li> I put fresh new aaa batteries in it twice.</li>
            <li> the trimmer part is small and great for those places near your ears because it wont cut you</li>
            <li> nail trimmers (one large, one</li>
            <li> The problems is that guard opens and closes by a sliding motion and locks when it get to the end -- because the &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; on the top is very smooth and locking mechanism sticks quite a bit (at least with the item I got), the impulse is to place your thumb at the top and push down.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer cuts pretty ok, not as well as a razor, but it will clear off the big stuff without harming the skin.  </li>
            <li> decent value, Thanks!</li>
            <li> This little gadget is amazing for removing unwanted body hair.</li>
            <li> have given 5 stars except the carrying case is really flimsy.</li>
            <li> Cheap CHINESE junk!!!</li>
            <li> Thanks everyone.</li>
            <li> All it really does is just pull your hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work well.</li>
            <li> Following it up with a razor will be needed of you want smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> Maybe my guard is just extra sticky, but I was surprised that there weren&#x27;t more complaints of this nature here.  </li>
            <li> The plastic guards do work, but there is no indication of just how close these are going to cut, which many other trimmers offer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The thing is, this could have been easily avoided by adding a small curve or guard at the end, by nesting the blade element lower down, relative to the guard, or just constructing the guard more competently, such that the locking and unlocking occur more smoothly.</li>
            <li> A case in point: I nearly wrote this off as junk at first because it did not remove a single fine neck hair.</li>
            <li> Better half uses it to keep his moustache and sideburns trimmed - I use it to remove the &#x27;devils bridge&#x27; eyebrow between my two brows.  </li>
            <li> Also, be careful because trimming your hair while looking in a mirror is not as easy as it seems.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In order to use this effectively you need to carefully follow the instructions, then become accustomed to the angle you need to hold it at for different trimming operations.</li>
            <li> I recently took a 10 day trip, and was amazed at how many of the items I had carried with me just to do the same thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seriously do not buy</li>
            <li> For a few dollars more, you can get a cordless trimmer that will hold a charge through the whole trim.</li>
            <li> I love the design having the blades parallel to the handle, instead of the traditional perpendicular orientation.  </li>
            <li> This is particularly an issue if you want to trim your hair as shown in the picture.  </li>
            <li> While it worked, it was decent, it did the job.  </li>
            <li> So I can say that it trims some hair but don&#x27;t count on it to be as strong as other battery powered</li>
            <li> cheaply made&lt;br /&gt;cutting power is minimal</li>
            <li> It would have been nice had the cost of including the grooming kit been used to improve the quality of the trimmer, but I do want to emphasize that it (the trimmer) does work if properly used and will last if you care for it properly.</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t the quality batteries I normally use.</li>
            <li> Regardless, this is an obvious design flaw (putting your fingers right in line with the blades during the sliding motion that expose them).  </li>
            <li> Feels a little flimsy in the hand compared to the better known brands but no issues so far.  </li>
            <li> Replaced bradn new batteries, but no luck.</li>
            <li> it may turn out that i love it if the replacement actually works longer than the first i just got it and havent even put batteries in it yet and the first one was defective as in many cases was proly just my turn to get the one bad one  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The trimmer feels good in the hand, not too big and clumsy.</li>
            <li> I used it for the back of my neck and sides of my head and found that I can alternate haircuts, it makes you look clean and professional, get this one guys!!</li>
            <li> Other than that, it was a enjoyable product to use, and I will definitely be telling others about it.</li>
            <li> When I bought I didn&#x60;t know well how it worked and when I slided it for the first time i cut my finger real deep!</li>
            <li> In the future, I am sure I will try it in other areas and see how it does, but for now I am rather content with it.  </li>
            <li> I hope that this indicates a better quality control from what appears to have been their past kits.</li>
            <li> The guard resists heavily at first and then gives way all at once, and because the blades rest in a groove inside the guard, the thumb (or other unlucky digit) gets dragged straight across them.  </li>
            <li> And Complete Junk.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Please do not waste your money on this piece of garbage.</li>
            <li> Get a plug-in trimmer or at least a better portable one.</li>
            <li> and we were both rather surprised at how well it did.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t really stay on properly.  </li>
            <li> Too much of a hassle to send back.  </li>
            <li> Never worked correctly, but it would have cost too much to send it back.</li>
            <li> But having looked at a number of customer reviews for products made by this company, and considering the state of their customer service, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this thing went through negligible safety testing.  </li>
            <li> Io ho piÃ¹ di novanta anni, quasi non cammino e non ho nessuno che vada a far la fila di ore</li>
            <li> I am a older female who bought this product for my nose and chin hair, uses that were advertised on TV.  </li>
            <li> It trims body hair, and with following directions and practice, you will see decent results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> WHAT I EXPECTED, I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND AS MY FIRST CHOICE.</li>
            <li> Bought new batteries and still not enough power.</li>
            <li> The device is a 2-in-1 broad trimmer and sculptor.  </li>
            <li> I hope that this indicates a better quality control from what appears to have been their past kits.&gt;I did not expect much after seeing all of the negative reviews, so I was pleasantly surprised with the kit that I received and how it tested out for me.</li>
            <li> However, with a little practice to get the angle right they will work as claimed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to keep all attachments together, especially if you travel.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, outstanding!</li>
            <li> It did have some issues when there was too much hair in the blade and the cover on the other end</li>
            <li> Even being extremely cognizant of the issue after the first major cut, I still found in some later uses that I couldn&#x27;t open the damn thing without getting</li>
            <li> They added new features, yes, but the overall design and construction remain the same second rate work.  </li>
            <li> not sharp enough will just pull the hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a gorilla but after 1 full body &amp;#34;trim&amp;#34;  the blades were dull.  </li>
            <li> It will do the job, but it takes time because the blades are not long and the blades are not the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it has no cutting power, however, it is a pretty useless device</li>
            <li> Use these in your travel kit (after learning to use them) for those emergency touch ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not expect much after seeing all of the negative reviews, so I was pleasantly surprised with the kit that I received and how it tested out for me.</li>
            <li> Received this trimmer as a gift and though the motor is a little Milquetoast, I had no real complaints at first.  </li>
            <li> I am a female with long hair</li>
            <li> It would not cut any of my hair even after multiple tries.  </li>
            <li> We had it too long to return and ended up throwing it out.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of time/money/resources/whatever.</li>
            <li> The larger end still works, but not very well.</li>
            <li> By far the biggest waste of money to date.</li>
            <li> Since I was trimming my own neck, &#x27;feeling&#x27; 45 degrees is not easy when your hand is behind your neck, so be a little patient and practice.</li>
            <li> Even though the batteries were new, there is very little power.  </li>
            <li> After about 4 weeks even after replacing new batteries the small trimmer stoped working.</li>
            <li> I recommend you consider purchasing this item if you are on the go, need away from home touch ups, or if you donâ€™t want the clutter of several other devices and their cords in your bathroom.  </li>
            <li> Received the product promptly, however, within a week of limited use, stopped working.</li>
            <li> When the sculpting tool is in use, a guard comes down over the lower (and larger) blade component, which can be seen (exposed) in the product photo.  </li>
            <li> The smaller trim side quit working with in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> both times the next day the batteries went dead.</li>
            <li> The process as shown of just combing does not really work.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> This works just as I expected it would.  </li>
            <li> not very well made.</li>
            <li> As I said, for me this resulted in an inch-long (and fairly deep, but narrow) cut diagonally along my thumb.  </li>
            <li> Again, I can&#x27;t speak for other uses for the product, but for me it is a keeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first thing that is wrong with this thing is the slider.</li>
            <li> WHILE USING THE OTHER END OF THIS ITEM.</li>
            <li> I found this to be a pretty mediocre trimmer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Is it extremely well made?  </li>
            <li> It is smaller than what it looks like but works well for small jobs.</li>
            <li> ne ho acquistati due (numero d&#x27;ordine 1017473616 -dist.</li>
            <li> Nor, like the other model I reviewed, will I be sticking this up my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, on just my second use, a serious design flaw caused me laceration on my thumb well over and inch long.  </li>
            <li> Of course the other comb ,once on is impossible to get of and the trimmer won&#x27;t let you turn it of as your struggling with it and ,then when i got it removed the blade assembly popped out and it won&#x27;t cut cleanly on evenly at all...</li>
            <li> Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> As others said, not worth a purchase.  </li>
            <li> When I received this , I had some hesitation in trying it after reading various negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> If you have a thick beard, there is not enough power to truly trim the hair.  </li>
            <li> You also get a zippered black faux leather case containing a toothbrush, comb, shoehorn, two nail clippers, a file and tweezers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The unit paid for itself in less than a month.</li>
            <li> Not sure what I expected from a &amp;#34;as seen on TV&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Was actually dumb enough to try it on my nose hairs while it was running.</li>
            <li> a little stronger than the micro touch max</li>
            <li> It is not good for thicker hair (it&#x27;s just not strong enough).</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> so I won&#x27;t waste my money.  </li>
            <li> Came within a few days.</li>
            <li> Just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Junk, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I threw it away within a couple of weeks, because it frustrated me too much.</li>
            <li> Not sure it was designed to cut the hair on your head, but I didn&#x27;t intend to use it for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Small trimmer stopped working within 2 months</li>
            <li> Wasted $30!</li>
            <li> Mine came with a grooming kit that was not much better quality than the trimmer.</li>
            <li> small Shoe Horn&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Then the small end stopped working.</li>
            <li> Am not able to reattach it.  </li>
            <li> The cutting head does NOT remove facial hair as demonstrated on TV!  </li>
            <li> Every review is negative</li>
            <li> nfg did not work in the least.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;attachments&amp;#34; don&#x27;t stay on and the motor runs too slow, so it pulls and breaks hair instead of trimming it correctly.</li>
            <li> Too bad it didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> This is the very worst in actual design of and body trimmer at one end and a micro trimmer at the other end.</li>
            <li> Motor too weak just pulls hair in nose and ears.</li>
            <li> The absolute worst purchase I have ever made on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> No problem with the seller , it&#x27;s the product that&#x27;s not good!</li>
            <li> It really is useless.  </li>
            <li> THE SWITCH FOR ON/OFF USE MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO USE</li>
            <li> It is extremely uncomfortable and very frustrating to shave with.</li>
            <li> What length is that cutting at??  </li>
            <li> Very sad for these order...</li>
            <li> Too bad and poor results with it!!!</li>
            <li> totally disappointed.</li>
            <li> this thing was the worst thing i ever bought.</li>
            <li> horrible, bought 3 of them for myself and gifts for fathers day, they all stopped working today</li>
            <li> It is a horrible product will not even cut the hair blade</li>
            <li> This is literally the worst trimmer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Terrible!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Received the product promptly, however, within a week of limited use, stopped working. Replaced bradn new batteries, but no luck. And of course the product is in-eligible for a return. Moving on to a different product. Buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li> As advertized great product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> The absolute worst purchase I have ever made on Amazon.  I should have known that &amp;#34;As Seen On TV&amp;#34; should have been read as &amp;#34;Total And Complete Junk.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was offered the Microtouch switchblade set in exchange for a review, and I have to say that the following is my honest opinion about the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all I think I may have gotten something different than some of those who have written earlier reviews on this product. Mine did come not just with the trimmer but a nice travel set complete with a shoe horn, toothbrush, fingernail clippers, file and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the switchblade just to do trimming on my face and chest, and to be honest with you it worked great for that purpose. Not sure it was designed to cut the hair on your head, but I didn&#x27;t intend to use it for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for something to travel with that will keep you groomed easily and without a lot of hassle then this works great. Again, I can&#x27;t speak for other uses for the product, but for me it is a keeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because I didn have a problem with the guard staying on. Other than that, it was a enjoyable product to use, and I will definitely be telling others about it.</li>
            <li> Every man should have one! Indeed, every person who grows hair should have one. It&#x27;s three or four grooming devices in one.&lt;br /&gt;Would have given 5 stars except the carrying case is really flimsy. It&#x27;s difficult to keep all attachments together, especially if you travel.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, outstanding!</li>
            <li> it dont work good i dont like it</li>
            <li> totally disappointed.</li>
            <li> Small trimmer stopped working within 2 months</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ver y happy for this experience. It was delivered On time.&lt;br /&gt;The quality was also fine</li>
            <li> This product without a doubt, is the consummate cheap Chinese junk. Right out of the box after insertion of the batteries it turns on. The on/off switch does not work. The only way to shut it off is open the battery chamber and remove the batteries. Was actually dumb enough to try it on my nose hairs while it was running. What a mistake! It started yanking on my nose hairs and had to rip it away. Yooowwww! Don&#x27;t buy this bogus product!</li>
            <li> a little stronger than the micro touch max it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Thought it would be a better product</li>
            <li> this thing was the worst thing i ever bought. the micro trimmer went out within the first two weeks. soon after that the rest of it went out, of course i did not keep the box so it is a total loss. DO NOT BUY THIS!</li>
            <li> cheaply made&lt;br /&gt;cutting power is minimal&lt;br /&gt;attachments are nice&lt;br /&gt;because it has no cutting power, however, it is a pretty useless device</li>
            <li> Cheap CHINESE junk!!! Wasted $30! Be lucky if it lasts 5 more minutes. Please do not waste your money on this piece of garbage.</li>
            <li> works great for what i need the trimmer part is small and great for those places near your ears because it wont cut you</li>
            <li> The first thing that is wrong with this thing is the slider. When I bought I didn&#x60;t know well how it worked and when I slided it for the first time i cut my finger real deep! After about 4 weeks even after replacing new batteries the small trimmer stoped working. I tried moving it to see if it was stuck...no luck. Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> If you have a thick beard, there is not enough power to truly trim the hair.  Also hair is a pain to clean from blade.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money. The smaller trim side quit working with in a few minutes. The larger side still works but does not remove hair as demo&#x27;ed. Better off buying a grooming kit at your local farm supply store.</li>
            <li> The cutting head does NOT remove facial hair as demonstrated on TV!  A distinct stubble still remains after using the shaving head.</li>
            <li> It takes 2 Triple AAA&#x27;s and it doesn&#x27;t seam the have the power that it shows in the TV clips it gets stuck in my beard.</li>
            <li> I used it for the back of my neck and sides of my head and found that I can alternate haircuts, it makes you look clean and professional, get this one guys!!</li>
            <li> I am a older female who bought this product for my nose and chin hair, uses that were advertised on TV.  It would not cut any of my hair even after multiple tries.  Even though the batteries were new, there is very little power.  I am in the process of returning this product.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would actually trim hair with the hair attachment, but it doesn&#x27;t.  Not sure what I expected from a &amp;#34;as seen on TV&amp;#34;, but it was something better than this.</li>
            <li> Drains fresh batteries within 7-8 minutes.  Does trim hair but feels severely underpowered.  As others said, not worth a purchase.  Get a plug-in trimmer or at least a better portable one.</li>
            <li> This has zero power.  It really is useless.  We had it too long to return and ended up throwing it out.</li>
            <li> This little gadget is amazing for removing unwanted body hair. I haven&#x27;t used any of the attachments yet but it&#x27;s great to have them</li>
            <li> I put fresh new aaa batteries in it twice. both times the next day the batteries went dead. it drains battery power when not in use.another piece of Chinese junk from the people planning on taking over the world. ha! good luck with that. just stick to making chop suey u jerks.</li>
            <li> Received this today. Does what they say it will do. Husband is very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a nice product</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work after  putting in batteries.</li>
            <li> Feels a little flimsy in the hand compared to the better known brands but no issues so far.  It does a great job on ears, nose and eyebrows.</li>
            <li> horrible, bought 3 of them for myself and gifts for fathers day, they all stopped working today</li>
            <li> If you plan on using it yourself it will not work. Definitely need a helper as you must lift the strands of hair for it to cut. You might be able to cut your front top and sides, but help is needed for the back. The process as shown of just combing does not really work.&lt;br /&gt;All together if someone else is helping you its ok.</li>
            <li> Every review is negative so I won&#x27;t waste my money.  Thanks everyone.</li>
            <li> Not all it is racked up to be.....</li>
            <li> This is the very worst in actual design of and body trimmer at one end and a micro trimmer at the other end. its so cheaply made that when u try to use the body trimmer end the sliding guard has to click it on and you can&#x27;t get the height comb to stay on. Of course the other comb ,once on is impossible to get of and the trimmer won&#x27;t let you turn it of as your struggling with it and ,then when i got it removed the blade assembly popped out and it won&#x27;t cut cleanly on evenly at all...ok, now the micro end has a litght to see what your trimming, except it was not cutting any hair or snag at it ...it was most upsetting and it now looking to replace it with sometime more highly reviewed and itn the same price range....</li>
            <li> It is a horrible product will not even cut the hair blade not sharp enough will just pull the hair. l wasn&#x27;t able to use it because it was not the same as shown in the TV ads that will cut your hair by just combing.  In the TV it says money back guarantee l wasn&#x27;t able to use it because it doesn&#x27;t work and a got an email that l can&#x27;t return the product that&#x27;s a rip off. Where is the money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> ...instead of paying $15 for this P.O.S., give me $10, and I&#x27;ll come over and kick ya in the jimmy. It&#x27;s sorta ok for nose/ear hair, but nothing great. All it really does is just pull your hair. Never cuts it. At all. Complete waste of time/money/resources/whatever. That plastic could have put to better use as a happy meal toy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a gorilla but after 1 full body &amp;#34;trim&amp;#34;  the blades were dull.  Poor quality.</li>
            <li> NOT QUITE WHAT I EXPECTED, I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND AS MY FIRST CHOICE. THE SWITCH FOR ON/OFF USE MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO USE AND BLADE GUARDS KEEP FALLING OFF WHILE USING THE OTHER END OF THIS ITEM.</li>
            <li> On a scale of one too ten this product  was a five.</li>
            <li> This is literally the worst trimmer I have ever used. Both ends of the trimmer stopped working the second time I used them. It is extremely uncomfortable and very frustrating to shave with. DO NOT BUY THIS. YOU WILL REGRET IT.</li>
            <li> Very sad for these order...Too bad and poor results with it!!!</li>
            <li> When I received this , I had some hesitation in trying it after reading various negative reviews.  However, I thought it performed rather well.  I am a female with long hair and I shave the underneath part to reduce the bulkiness of my hair.  I had a friend use the microtouch and we were both rather surprised at how well it did.  It did have some issues when there was too much hair in the blade and the cover on the other end doesn&#x27;t really stay on properly.  I also used it to trim some nose hairs and it also did well with that.  In the future, I am sure I will try it in other areas and see how it does, but for now I am rather content with it.  Also, the extras it brings is a nice touch!</li>
            <li> This works just as I expected it would.  Better half uses it to keep his moustache and sideburns trimmed - I use it to remove the &#x27;devils bridge&#x27; eyebrow between my two brows.  The trimmer portion works if you are only wanting to trim off fly away hair using the trimmer brush to keep things even.  I would never consider this as a replacement for a traditional trimmer - either cordless or corded.  It&#x27;s for quick jobs and for that it works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the grooming kit that came with this.  A person can never have too many sets of clippers, too many combs, too many lint brushes.  And the trimmer and all its accessories fit inside the leather-like case.  This kit will be tossed into the suitcase for the many road trips we take.  It&#x27;s perfect for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to admit that I did receive this product free in exchange for a review.  I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a birthday present for my  Dad.  He is 78 and he said he would have to read the instructions first.</li>
            <li> It has exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I received one of these kits as a review sample. Up front, this is definitely a consumer-level trimmer and nothing that a pro or even a semi-pro would use. However, it doesn&#x27;t claim to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to use this effectively you need to carefully follow the instructions, then become accustomed to the angle you need to hold it at for different trimming operations. A case in point: I nearly wrote this off as junk at first because it did not remove a single fine neck hair. After a few trials I managed to hold it at the required 45 degree angle and it worked beautifully. Since I was trimming my own neck, &#x27;feeling&#x27; 45 degrees is not easy when your hand is behind your neck, so be a little patient and practice. When this trimmer works - it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb attachments are not as effective as the large trimmer head that is built into the handle. However, with a little practice to get the angle right they will work as claimed. Note that you&#x27;ll need multiple passes to get it even. Also, be careful because trimming your hair while looking in a mirror is not as easy as it seems. My first trim came out looking like I used a Veg-O-Matic and I had to get a friend to straighten it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this is cheaply made, but it&#x27;s also cheaply priced. Mine came with a grooming kit that was not much better quality than the trimmer. It would have been nice had the cost of including the grooming kit been used to improve the quality of the trimmer, but I do want to emphasize that it (the trimmer) does work if properly used and will last if you care for it properly.</li>
            <li> it may turn out that i love it if the replacement actually works longer than the first i just got it and havent even put batteries in it yet and the first one was defective as in many cases was proly just my turn to get the one bad one  if there is a change i will ammend my report</li>
            <li> I found this to be a pretty mediocre trimmer. It does trim and the kit comes with a ton of stuff. None of it is superb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer comes with batteries and it can take off fine sparse hair. It is not good for thicker hair (it&#x27;s just not strong enough). So I can say that it trims some hair but don&#x27;t count on it to be as strong as other battery powered trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for.  And if you do not expect more, you will be happy with what you get.  This product does what it says it will.  It trims body hair, and with following directions and practice, you will see decent results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it extremely well made?  No. It&#x27;s cheap plastic and it works on batteries.  It can never have the power of a trimmer with a motor and a power cord.  It will do the job, but it takes time because the blades are not long and the blades are not the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with two sets of AAA batteries and two extra blades for the full-size trimmer and two for the micro trimmer.  It also comes with four attachments to help you control hair length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprise, surprise!  You also get a zippered black faux leather case containing a toothbrush, comb, shoehorn, two nail clippers, a file and tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a free sample for review from the distributor.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product in order to put it to the test so that I could give it an honest review. I have only had mine a few days, so I really can&#x27;t certify as to longevity, but I did fully test its immediate function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, this is not just the trimmer, although it is the star of the package. Mine included a complete and handy grooming set. It includes:&lt;br /&gt;Two nail trimmers (one large, one small)&lt;br /&gt;A nail file&lt;br /&gt;Tweezers&lt;br /&gt;A comb&lt;br /&gt;A toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;A Lint remover&lt;br /&gt;A small Shoe Horn&lt;br /&gt;The MicroTouch Switchblade and attachments&lt;br /&gt;A case to keep all of these items together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice that the description here on Amazon indicates it is a 6 piece set. The letter included in mine indicated that what I received was what would be sold here on Amazon. I recently took a 10 day trip, and was amazed at how many of the items I had carried with me just to do the same thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the toothbrush is probably not one I would normally use, it would be handy in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I checked the switchblade out several ways. I shaped my eyebrows, I removed some leg and arm hair (yep, it can take care of your legs, ladies, if you need it, and I trimmed up the back of my neck following a hair cut about a week ago. It is also good for a bikini cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s be honest, I probably wouldn&#x27;t use this to shave anyone&#x27;s hair. But, for quick touch-ups and an emergency, it works even better than I expected. I haven&#x27;t seen the TV ad, so I can&#x27;t compare, but nothing ever works as great as as seen on TV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some suggestions -&lt;br /&gt;It is important to hold the blade correctly for it to cut correctly.&lt;br /&gt;Mine came with batteries. They weren&#x27;t the quality batteries I normally use. I will replace them, and don&#x27;t expect these to last too long.&lt;br /&gt;You will want to keep your regular razor and hair cutters. Use these in your travel kit (after learning to use them) for those emergency touch ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not expect much after seeing all of the negative reviews, so I was pleasantly surprised with the kit that I received and how it tested out for me. I hope that this indicates a better quality control from what appears to have been their past kits.&gt;I did not expect much after seeing all of the negative reviews, so I was pleasantly surprised with the kit that I received and how it tested out for me.

            <li> nfg did not work in the least.</li>
            <li> Does not work at all.</li>
            <li> Great for trimming some unwanted hairs! I use it every morning before work! Great product for men and women. It definitely works well! Buy it today! You won&#x27;t regret it!!!!</li>
            <li> not very well made. Worked (kinda) for about 5 minutes. Then the small end stopped working. The larger end still works, but not very well. Great concept. poorly and cheaply executed.</li>
            <li> I was offered the Microtouch switchblade set in exchange for a review, and the following is my honest opinion about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed with the packaging and the presentation of the item.  It wasnâ€™t just thrown in a box and shipped out.  My trimmer came with the trimmer but a nice travel set complete with a shoe horn, fingernail clippers, file and more. The trimmer itself with its accessories on the other side of the box nicely arranged so they donâ€™t break.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer feels good in the hand, not too big and clumsy. This is not made to be a work horse.  It is great for those straggler hairs, and when you need a quick fix.</li>
            <li> Not enough power.  Cheaply made.  Went to change the battery thinking maybe it would help and the metal prong that touches the end of the battery to make it connect, fell to the floor.  Am not able to reattach it.  Trash.</li>
            <li> Terrible!  It sounds like it&#x27;s working but removed no hair!  We then tried again  and tested it on his forearm, and again nothing.  Too much of a hassle to send back.  You should not try this.  FYI the seller sent this very fast! No problem with the seller , it&#x27;s the product that&#x27;s not good!</li>
            <li> Came within a few days. Works great. Just what I needed. Happy customer!</li>
            <li> OK...I&#x27;m practicing with the thing. A lot cheaper to stay neat between haircuts. The unit paid for itself in less than a month. I&#x27;m getting better at using it. I may start on the dog next.</li>
            <li> Works okay. It is smaller than what it looks like but works well for small jobs.</li>
            <li> Did not work like exspected</li>
            <li> Just a waste of money. Never worked correctly, but it would have cost too much to send it back. I threw it away within a couple of weeks, because it frustrated me too much. The &amp;#34;attachments&amp;#34; don&#x27;t stay on and the motor runs too slow, so it pulls and breaks hair instead of trimming it correctly.</li>
            <li> Received the first one which did not work after one use. I asked for a refund but instead was sent a replacement which also stopped working. By far the biggest waste of money to date.</li>
            <li> Received this trimmer as a gift and though the motor is a little Milquetoast, I had no real complaints at first.  However, on just my second use, a serious design flaw caused me laceration on my thumb well over and inch long.  The device is a 2-in-1 broad trimmer and sculptor.  When the sculpting tool is in use, a guard comes down over the lower (and larger) blade component, which can be seen (exposed) in the product photo.  The problems is that guard opens and closes by a sliding motion and locks when it get to the end -- because the &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; on the top is very smooth and locking mechanism sticks quite a bit (at least with the item I got), the impulse is to place your thumb at the top and push down.  The guard resists heavily at first and then gives way all at once, and because the blades rest in a groove inside the guard, the thumb (or other unlucky digit) gets dragged straight across them.  As I said, for me this resulted in an inch-long (and fairly deep, but narrow) cut diagonally along my thumb.  I honestly could not have gotten a nastier cut if I had gone at the thumb with a straight-edge razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing is, this could have been easily avoided by adding a small curve or guard at the end, by nesting the blade element lower down, relative to the guard, or just constructing the guard more competently, such that the locking and unlocking occur more smoothly. But having looked at a number of customer reviews for products made by this company, and considering the state of their customer service, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this thing went through negligible safety testing.  Maybe my guard is just extra sticky, but I was surprised that there weren&#x27;t more complaints of this nature here.  Regardless, this is an obvious design flaw (putting your fingers right in line with the blades during the sliding motion that expose them).  Even being extremely cognizant of the issue after the first major cut, I still found in some later uses that I couldn&#x27;t open the damn thing without getting knicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, not recommended for those who don&#x27;t want to start out their day with razor cuts on their extremities.e damn thing without getting knicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, not recommended for those who don&#x27;t want to start out their day with razor cuts on their extremities.</li>
            <li> Motor too weak just pulls hair in nose and ears. Bought new batteries and still not enough power. Should of known it sounded to good to be true!!!!</li>
            <li> I ignored all the warnings and bought this because then idea is great for my needs. It is absolutely a piece of garbage that will break within your first 5 uses. Seriously do not buy</li>
            <li> Works well, and shipped promptly..... decent value, Thanks!</li>
            <li> For a few dollars more, you can get a cordless trimmer that will hold a charge through the whole trim. The microtouch required a battery change before I finished trimming my beard. The price of batteries will rapidly justify the additional cost of a rechargeable trimmer.</li>
            <li> Not like what I seen on TV</li>
            <li> Junk, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Prodotto 496954: ne ho acquistati due (numero d&#x27;ordine 1017473616 -dist. spediz. n. 9301112677 - ordine del 08/07/14);&lt;br /&gt;uno sembra funzioni (l&#x27;ho spedito in regalo a un parente), l&#x27; altro neppure si accende, nonostante i ripetuti tentativi. Come da indicazione sulla distinta di spedizione ho telefonato al n. 199303000, e mi Ã¨ stato richiesto il mio numero di telefono (063330718) per poi comunicarmi possibili soluzioni. Io ho piÃ¹ di novanta anni, quasi non cammino e non ho nessuno che vada a far la fila di ore all&#x27;ufficio postale - di Roma- per restituire l&#x27;attrezzo non funzionante. Ho chiesto a Media Shopping di inviarmi un apparecchio funzionante, mentre io terrÃ² a disposizione quello avariato. Finora non ho ricevuto risposta. A.R.Colucci - maselluzzo@alice.it</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work well.</li>
            <li> great for trimming nose and ear hair...</li>
            <li> The Microtouch Switchblade is a great device.  It takes the place of several other trimming devices and is also great to have in your grab &amp; go bag.  It takes AA batteries, so no need to worry about needing an outlet or forgetting a charger.  This is great for camping, or even if you need to do a little touch up on the go.  I love the design having the blades parallel to the handle, instead of the traditional perpendicular orientation.  This design makes it much easier to tidy up the back of my neck and hairline.  It also makes it easier to trim nose and ear areas.  The light is a nice bonus so you can see what you are trimming.  I recommend you consider purchasing this item if you are on the go, need away from home touch ups, or if you donâ€™t want the clutter of several other devices and their cords in your bathroom.  I received the Microtouch Switchblade in exchange for this review.  All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> *Disclosure: I was contacted by a representative for IdeaVillage and given a sample of this product specifically for the purpose of giving my thoughts on it.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When offered this newer version of the Microtouch, I thought I&#x27;d see of the maker had taken any of the criticism from the original design and improve on it.  In short, no.  They added new features, yes, but the overall design and construction remain the same second rate work.  The trimmer cuts pretty ok, not as well as a razor, but it will clear off the big stuff without harming the skin.  Following it up with a razor will be needed of you want smooth skin.  The plastic guards do work, but there is no indication of just how close these are going to cut, which many other trimmers offer.  This is particularly an issue if you want to trim your hair as shown in the picture.  What length is that cutting at??  A #2?  #4?  I for one will not be experimenting to find out.  Nor, like the other model I reviewed, will I be sticking this up my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, yeah, it&#x27;s cheap.  But if you want a cheap trimmer, there are better options.  If you want a good trimmer, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> Better than going to a barber.</li>
            <li> It lasted about two months.  While it worked, it was decent, it did the job.  Too bad it didn&#x27;t last.</li>
