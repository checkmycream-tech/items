            <li>This is the best soap dispenser IN THE UNIVERSE!</li>
            <li>This is the best price that I found online.</li>
            <li>Great product!  </li>
            <li>Smells surprisingly good!</li>
            <li>The soap is very entertaining!</li>
            <li>Great buy.</li>
            <li>The sticker is still in great shape and the pump works like a charm.  </li>
            <li>Everyone that goes in our bathroom LOL.</li>
            <li>Great gag gift</li>
            <li>This product is great.</li>
            <li>This soap container is great.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many times perfect strangers have shouted &amp;#34;Hey  Lady!</li>
            <li>Eventually the idea somehow morphed in my mind as a potentially successful pickup line.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>look on her face says, \\&quot;Gee, that was the greatest thing a guy has ever said to me, he&#x27;s so witty and charming\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>In all seriousness, great gag gift, smells nice, does what soap does.</li>
            <li>Maybe You Touched Your Genitals Liquid Hand Soap with the work request, because there&#x27;s a good chance</li>
            <li>It got a good reaction out of my aunts and uncles as well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite impressed with the label, which has survived, unscathed, after many many uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Basically keep this handy anytime you know that Jeff from IT will be around.</li>
            <li>In a home where everything is &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;, then when someone happens to really, really look at the type of handwash they are using, PRICELESS!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice, functional gag</li>
            <li>This soap is hilarious, works well, and smells good.</li>
            <li>I mostly use it for freshening up my hands after I fondle my own genitals.  </li>
            <li>She got a great laugh out of it.  </li>
            <li>* January 13, 2017 -- Still going strong!  </li>
            <li>Everyone who sees this in my bathroom gets a good laugh out of it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it</li>
            <li>It was good for a laugh at work, where I put it in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this item for laughs in our guest bathroom but the soap is actually one of the best smelling soaps I&#x27;ve found!  </li>
            <li>I say more?  </li>
            <li>This is hilarious.</li>
            <li>Makes me wish more people used my bathroom</li>
            <li>I did not get Liquid Soap in pump top dispenser as advertised.</li>
            <li>This soap is hilarious.</li>
            <li>My plan is to use a favorite liquid soap to refill the container when this one is used up.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend.</li>
            <li>Everyone will love this gift, unless they have no sense of humor.</li>
            <li>I love it and so do my friends.</li>
            <li>As a spoof item this was a perfect one up my area of joking.</li>
            <li>It lathers nicely and has a fresh clean fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is a fine dispensable soap product that I recommend.  </li>
            <li>Also, they filled my order so quickly!</li>
            <li>Definitely a fun novelty for sure.</li>
            <li>great if you need to wash your hands when you open the package.</li>
            <li>One exception may be during televised women&#x27;s beach volleyball tournament week, but that isn&#x27;t relevant to this review, so moving on...</li>
            <li>I finally worked up the nerve and approached an attractive, senior manager at work to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In retrospect</li>
            <li>A fun find ... can&#x27;t say much more than that</li>
            <li>The soap is cheap, but it works.</li>
            <li>If you have friends like mine, sometimes a gentle reminder like the one offered on this bottle will help them be better, more civilized people.</li>
            <li>Soap is mildly scented but great for general hand washing.</li>
            <li>People who have not been to the loo in my house wonder why people are always leaving the room with a huge smile on their face.  </li>
            <li>It was totally worth it and a huge hit with the girls.</li>
            <li>and the entire family had a good laugh.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>It was a hit with our guests at our New Year&#x27;s Eve party - people would leave the bathroom chuckling :)</li>
            <li>When I first saw this product I was delighted to find that there was finally a solution to my problem.  </li>
            <li>These products from Blue Q are hilarious!</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant scent unlike some other soaps that I know plus it has aloe in it.</li>
            <li>In fact someone liked it enough to take it.</li>
            <li>a fun find . . .</li>
            <li>a fun find.</li>
            <li>He puts it out on the counter  at my parents house whenever we have a family get together, and I laugh every time I see it.  </li>
            <li>I shook hands with an employee that was notorious for touching his genitals, the second he turned away</li>
            <li>soap filled the bag completely but none in the dispenser.</li>
            <li>Was funny but took close to six weeks for delivery.</li>
            <li>A pretty gal shaking hands with this fellow, and the caption \\&quot;Maybe</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe hotties these days are all about the funny.  </li>
            <li>, I prolly didn&#x27;t come off like the funny, suave charmer that I had envisioned when I practiced this in the mirror at home that morning.  </li>
            <li>It is entirely possible that I came across more as a sweaty, stammering, stalker-perv who wouldn&#x27;t let go of her hand.  </li>
            <li>I just bought it because I thought it was funny...</li>
            <li>because you know Jeff from IT will be first in line for the goods.</li>
            <li>This is a huge hit in the guest bath with a house full of teenage boys!</li>
            <li>and they thought it was so funny.</li>
            <li>Or it just might be really funny.</li>
            <li>The first time someone comes to my apartment and uses my restroom, I always hear laughter...</li>
            <li>But funny as heck when guests come over.</li>
            <li>Obviously a gag gift, but fun!!  </li>
            <li>Everyone mentions how much they are amused by my soap when they visit.</li>
            <li>A must have for the office-keep one handy by the conference room speaker phone, definitely send several bottles to the IT</li>
            <li>While I clean, polish and coif my genitals several times a day, I do not think that the others in my office are as thorough as I am when it comes to genital hygiene,  </li>
            <li>The actual soap it comes with isn&#x27;t anything special but that should not be the reason you are looking at this product.</li>
            <li>So, naturally I would advise against that line of thinking altogether and suggest that you just use the soap and don&#x27;t get any funny ideas.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>Getting your new Smartphone set up on the Business Server-include a bottle of</li>
            <li>suppose the pickup line idea first came to me after using this product for several days.  </li>
            <li>What I really need is the &amp;#34;I definitely touched my junk&amp;#34; soap</li>
            <li>As a teen I touch my genitals very often and as a result my hands get \\&quot;unclean\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It shipped fast even with the standard shipping.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my 14 year old&#x27;s bathroom.  </li>
            <li>The soap, being secondary, did it&#x27;s duty (he said &#x27;duty&#x27;) and has been refilled many times.  </li>
            <li>Definitely something to put in your guest bathroom if you aren&#x27;t straight laced.</li>
            <li>I got alcohol based Hand Sanitizer in very small punch top bottles.</li>
            <li>It also does not dry out your hands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just so freaking funny to see everyday.  </li>
            <li>plastered all over the outside - a small concern, but worth mentioning.</li>
            <li>Whatever the case may be, this makes me laugh a little every time I wash my hands after using the toilet, and has gotten the same response from several of my friends.</li>

            <li> The soap is a little thin, though and you will consume it quickly.  </li>
            <li> I got this soap for my little brother for Christmas(well, 24 year old little brother).  </li>
            <li> Not particularly nice smelling, just general soap smell.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m not talking about an abnormally frequent amount... prolly about the same amount as you, the reader.  </li>
            <li> only downside is price(it&#x27;s expensive for just basic handsoap, you&#x27;re paying for the label).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it works at all but just for the look I paid for it.</li>
            <li> The soap is decent, doesnt smell too bad, though it is a bit drying.</li>
            <li> at least that&#x27;s how the story played out in my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just a tad bit expensive for how small the bottle was.</li>
            <li> packed or packaged poorly.</li>
            <li> a bit awkward</li>
            <li> Praise for awkward speechlessness when this is just opened.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I often touch my genitals without realizing it! I can&#x27;t tell you how many times perfect strangers have shouted &amp;#34;Hey  Lady! Get your hands out of there!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;If you too are an unconscious groin manipulator, this is the product for you! It won&#x27;t prevent accidental genital explorations but boy will you be relieved to know that just in case--- you&#x27;re hands clean!&lt;br /&gt;One warning-- you need to rinse with water after you use this. It burns if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Everyone who sees this in my bathroom gets a good laugh out of it. Definitely a fun novelty for sure. Soap is mildly scented but great for general hand washing.</li>
            <li> I shook hands with an employee that was notorious for touching his genitals, the second he turned away I ran to the bathroom, punched through the mirror sliding door were its kept, and yanked it out! I washed my hands so thoroughly that genital germs run in fear when they see me coming. Now I can walk with confidence knowing that this guy will not have to worry about genital germs. In all seriousness, great gag gift, smells nice, does what soap does.</li>
            <li> great if you need to wash your hands when you open the package. soap filled the bag completely but none in the dispenser. packed or packaged poorly.</li>
            <li> I buy these for house warming, bridal showers, etc. We refill ours. The actual soap it comes with isn&#x27;t anything special but that should not be the reason you are looking at this product. I LOVE it and so do all of our family members and guests.</li>
            <li> An eye catcher in our bathroom, and has even &amp;#34;shamed&amp;#34; some folks into washing their hands! The soap is decent, doesnt smell too bad, though it is a bit drying.</li>
            <li> What I really need is the &amp;#34;I definitely touched my junk&amp;#34; soap</li>
            <li> Was funny but took close to six weeks for delivery.</li>
            <li> This is a fine dispensable soap product that I recommend.  It lathers nicely and has a fresh clean fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose the pickup line idea first came to me after using this product for several days.  I mostly use it for freshening up my hands after I fondle my own genitals.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m not talking about an abnormally frequent amount... prolly about the same amount as you, the reader.  One exception may be during televised women&#x27;s beach volleyball tournament week, but that isn&#x27;t relevant to this review, so moving on...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhoo, for days everytime I wash my hands, I see this picture on the label. A pretty gal shaking hands with this fellow, and the caption \\&quot;Maybe you touched your genitals.\\&quot; Eventually the idea somehow morphed in my mind as a potentially successful pickup line.&lt;br /&gt;The look on her face says, \\&quot;Gee, that was the greatest thing a guy has ever said to me, he&#x27;s so witty and charming\\&quot;... at least that&#x27;s how the story played out in my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe hotties these days are all about the funny.  Maybe she&#x27;ll know about the Amazon novelty soap that my funnly lil quip is referencing.  She&#x27;ll be putty in my hands...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I finally worked up the nerve and approached an attractive, senior manager at work to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In retrospect, I prolly didn&#x27;t come off like the funny, suave charmer that I had envisioned when I practiced this in the mirror at home that morning.  It is entirely possible that I came across more as a sweaty, stammering, stalker-perv who wouldn&#x27;t let go of her hand.  So, naturally I would advise against that line of thinking altogether and suggest that you just use the soap and don&#x27;t get any funny ideas.  Here&#x27;s hoping I don&#x27;t get summoned to the HR department anytime soon.</li>
            <li> I just bought it because I thought it was funny... And maybe get people to wash their hands</li>
            <li> It was good for a laugh at work, where I put it in the bathroom.  In fact someone liked it enough to take it.</li>
            <li> I keep this soap in my kitchen. It&#x27;s a big hit!</li>
            <li> Ordered for nephew.  He loved it!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for laughs in our guest bathroom but the soap is actually one of the best smelling soaps I&#x27;ve found!  Highly recommended.  The soap is a little thin, though and you will consume it quickly.  After all, the purchase was made for the bottle....</li>
            <li> While I clean, polish and coif my genitals several times a day, I do not think that the others in my office are as thorough as I am when it comes to genital hygiene,  (I&#x27;m talking to you Jeff in IT). A must have for the office-keep one handy by the conference room speaker phone, definitely send several bottles to the IT department,(yes I&#x27;m talking to you Jeff). Bringing in Pizza or doughnuts for the gang -don&#x27;t forget the Maybe You Touched Your Genitals Liquid Hand Soap-because you know Jeff from IT will be first in line for the goods. Getting your new Smartphone set up on the Business Server-include a bottle of Maybe You Touched Your Genitals Liquid Hand Soap with the work request, because there&#x27;s a good chance that SOB Jeff will be the one who gets the help ticket.  Basically keep this handy anytime you know that Jeff from IT will be around.</li>
            <li> As a teen I touch my genitals very often and as a result my hands get \\&quot;unclean\\&quot;. When I first saw this product I was delighted to find that there was finally a solution to my problem.  That solution was Blue Q Liquid Hand Soap. It shipped fast even with the standard shipping.  The bottle is 7 x 2 x 3 inches and weighs 9.9 ounces. The liquid hand soap fills up to the shoulders of the bottle. It has a pleasant scent unlike some other soaps that I know plus it has aloe in it. It also does not dry out your hands. Overall this soap has met my expectations for cleaning my hands after I touch my genitals.</li>
            <li> A fun find ... can&#x27;t say much more than that so will repeat it ... a fun find . . . a fun find.</li>
            <li> I bought one for my sister (who has 2 boys) and bought one for myself. We both couldn&#x27;t stop laughing - and neither could our boys! The soap is very entertaining!</li>
            <li> Great buy. Smells surprisingly good!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 14 year old&#x27;s bathroom.  Need I say more?  His friends simply crack up every time they go.</li>
            <li> People who have not been to the loo in my house wonder why people are always leaving the room with a huge smile on their face.  The soap, being secondary, did it&#x27;s duty (he said &#x27;duty&#x27;) and has been refilled many times.  I&#x27;m quite impressed with the label, which has survived, unscathed, after many many uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**edit** January 13, 2017 -- Still going strong!  The sticker is still in great shape and the pump works like a charm.  This is the best soap dispenser IN THE UNIVERSE!</li>
            <li> Friend now has plenty of hand wash in his apartment.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a prank at Bunco night.  It was totally worth it and a huge hit with the girls.</li>
            <li> This is hilarious. Everyone that goes in our bathroom LOL.</li>
            <li> Makes me wish more people used my bathroom</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Just a tad bit expensive for how small the bottle was. Great gag gift</li>
            <li> This is a huge hit in the guest bath with a house full of teenage boys!</li>
            <li> Obviously a gag gift, but fun!!  In a home where everything is &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;, then when someone happens to really, really look at the type of handwash they are using, PRICELESS!!!</li>
            <li> I got this soap for my little brother for Christmas(well, 24 year old little brother).  He puts it out on the counter  at my parents house whenever we have a family get together, and I laugh every time I see it.  It got a good reaction out of my aunts and uncles as well.  It&#x27;s a nice, functional gag gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is price(it&#x27;s expensive for just basic handsoap, you&#x27;re paying for the label).</li>
            <li> These products from Blue Q are hilarious! I purchase them for just about all of my friends.</li>
            <li> This product is great. From now on we can touch our genitals all day long and not worry about people visiting giving us a handshake. It took weeks to ship to the Netherlands, so I wished I bought a box of them.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to say a word.  I just put this in bathroom my sons share and now look who is washing up!</li>
            <li> As a spoof item this was a perfect one up my area of joking. I&#x27;m not sure if it works at all but just for the look I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I have a daughter who is a health and food inspector.  She always has big dispensers of sanitizer around the home and her office.  She got a great laugh out of it.  So did I.</li>
            <li> I did not get Liquid Soap in pump top dispenser as advertised. I got alcohol based Hand Sanitizer in very small punch top bottles. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It was a hit with our guests at our New Year&#x27;s Eve party - people would leave the bathroom chuckling :)</li>
            <li> This was given as a gift and they thought it was so funny.</li>
            <li> This soap is hilarious. End of story. I snuck it into my brother&#x27;s bathroom when I came to visit for Christmas and the entire family had a good laugh. The packaging was discreet, so it didn&#x27;t arrive with the world GENITALS plastered all over the outside - a small concern, but worth mentioning. The soap is cheap, but it works. I found this at a local gift store, Patina, but it was more expensive there. This is the best price that I found online. Recommended.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just so freaking funny to see everyday.  It&#x27;s how I can tell if guests have opened my medicine cabinet -  if they come out laughing.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Also, they filled my order so quickly!</li>
            <li> This soap container is great. Everyone gets a chuckle when they see it in my bathroom. The soap has an &#x27;industrial&#x27; aroma that reminds me of a public restroom but it&#x27;s not unpleasant. My plan is to use a favorite liquid soap to refill the container when this one is used up.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend.</li>
            <li> If you have friends like mine, sometimes a gentle reminder like the one offered on this bottle will help them be better, more civilized people. Or it just might be really funny. Whatever the case may be, this makes me laugh a little every time I wash my hands after using the toilet, and has gotten the same response from several of my friends.</li>
            <li> got my coworker with this and he still has no idea who gave it to him!</li>
            <li> Everyone mentions how much they are amused by my soap when they visit. The first time someone comes to my apartment and uses my restroom, I always hear laughter...a bit awkward</li>
            <li> Your basic hand soap, if even that. Not particularly nice smelling, just general soap smell. But funny as heck when guests come over.</li>
            <li> Praise for awkward speechlessness when this is just opened. Everyone will love this gift, unless they have no sense of humor. In that case, keep it for yourself.</li>
            <li> This soap is hilarious, works well, and smells good. Definitely something to put in your guest bathroom if you aren&#x27;t straight laced. I love it and so do my friends.</li>
