            <li> Great smell . Summary! Arrived on time. Would buy again</li>
            <li> I purchased this scent after smelling it on an acquaintance and it was lovely and smelled like vanilla!!! I got this in a timely fashion but no scent of vanilla at all. I was a bit leary about buying a scent that is no longer being made, not to mention the ingredients are all chemical.  I would have been better off using essential oils---lesson learned.</li>
            <li> I have worn this fragrance for several years and it is becoming hard to find.  I was pleased with the delivery time.</li>
            <li> not so sure what I think.  Is it or is it not the real Vanilla Fields?  Looks the same except for the packaging box and I would have to buy one retail to see if the smell is as strong or quickly fades or I would have to write Coty and ask.......hmmmmmm</li>
            <li> Not the fragrance it was in the 70s</li>
            <li> excelente lo recomiendo</li>
            <li> Makes you remember the good old days. I get great compliment.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I thought it had a vanilla fragrance.    Unfortunately, there is not even a hint of vanilla in the fragrance.  The ingredients don&#x27;t show anything but alcohol and chemicals.  Frankly, I wouldn&#x27;t have cared about the ingredients if it smelled like vanilla but it doesn&#x27;t. It smells like ant spray, really bad. I would never buy or recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> it so cozy to be in this fragrant cloud of the COTY Vanilla Fields ))) I like this aroma very much</li>
            <li> Delightful fragrance -- so happy to have found it on Amazon (apparently no longer available in stores).  I always get compliments when I wear it.  Arrived on time and at a fair price.</li>
            <li> Product was as stated, arrived quickly, very pleased. Size is great for carrying in purse.</li>
            <li> Been using for a few years, but is difficult to find locally.  Found it here for a very good price and with free shipping.  Can&#x27;t beat a deal like that.  Would recommend this product to any woman who likes to smell nice.</li>
            <li> Not too overpowering, but still enough to be noticeable</li>
            <li> smelled great on my wife.</li>
            <li> Very excited because I cannot find this in the stores anymore!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.  I have for years.  I have so much trouble finding it locally at a reasonable price.</li>
