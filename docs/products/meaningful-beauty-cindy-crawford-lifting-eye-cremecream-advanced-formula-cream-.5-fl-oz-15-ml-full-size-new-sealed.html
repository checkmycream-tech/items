            <li>Having no work done cosmetically I am proud to say I cannot live without MEANINGFUL BEAUTY!  </li>
            <li>I love meaningful beauty by Cindy Crawford.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Like this, but not in love...</li>
            <li>I find using the Creme de Serum much more soothing to the eye area and would just use that instead, morning and night.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>Love the creme De serum will just use that.</li>
            <li>Glad I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>Meaningful beauty works</li>
            <li>This is my favorite eye cream, but I use it in combination with Estee Lauder Resilience eye cream.  </li>
            <li>If anything, it made the wrinkles more visible.  </li>
            <li>you might work on most but not on me.</li>
            <li>I received this product for free in return for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this purchase, but not the way it was just thrown into a box with the spa chemicals I also ordered.</li>
            <li>I like being able to by this product without joining the &amp;#34;club&amp;#34;  I want to be able to order this when I want to and not when the &amp;#34;club&amp;#34; says I have to.</li>
            <li>and that makes me feel pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as I expected but ok, I bought the Meaningful Beauty package on a trial, not as good as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this product and I am so glad that I didn&#x27;t spend any money on it.  </li>
            <li>the consistency of this new formulated eye cream is great too...very smooth.</li>
            <li>Hands down best eyecream ever.</li>
            <li>I can see where fine lines have disappeared.</li>
            <li>cream pulls it right up and stays for most of the day.</li>
            <li>First time I tried it, love it.  </li>
            <li>and, so far, better than anything else I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve used a lot!</li>
            <li>I ordered the whole set from the Cindy Crawford Meaningful Beauty</li>
            <li>, I feel good about it , I see a big difference</li>
            <li>The Eye Creme is the only thing that is any good.</li>
            <li>However, to be fair, I&#x27;ve only used it for about three weeks.  </li>
            <li>FIRST OBTAINED THIS WITH A SPECIAL TV SPECIAL</li>
            <li>the advanced eye wrinkle cream worked right away by smoothing the fine lines and crows feet under my eyes, I was impressed especially since the other products didn&#x27;t work, this worked the first time I used it, you can even feel the tingling...</li>
            <li>Really took away the fine lines.</li>
            <li>I bought this REALLY anticipating something fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not even worth 3 bucks.</li>
            <li>It will absorb on its on and you will start to see results pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I really noticed how good the Vernal actually was working when I switched back to Meaningful Beauty</li>
            <li>Not as good as several other brands, but not bad!!</li>
            <li>I ordered the whole meaningful beauty line and the other products were just ok and will not be re ordering them....</li>
            <li>Like I said, it had great reviews, and different things work for different people.</li>
            <li>Other creams from target worked better on fine lines and puffiness.</li>
            <li>Seller sent out very fast.  </li>
            <li>Gets rid of puffy eyes, fine lines and even though I am 70 years old, no one ever can guess my age</li>
            <li>This really works!  </li>
            <li>which mine are pretty severe.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li>Make sure you dab a good pea size under each eye but do not rub it in at all (which is what I was doing wrong)</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing for my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I really like this eye cream.</li>
            <li>Seems to work well, but I think you need all the products as a combo to really see a difference</li>
            <li>This lifting cream really works.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see a difference and it burns.</li>
            <li>I order this through Meaningful beauty call center.</li>
            <li>Paid twice as much... turns out</li>
            <li>after 1 week of use the dark circles look more pronounced.</li>
            <li>and my eye brows aren&#x27;t as high as they used to be.  </li>
            <li>But, all her products are radiant, soft and really works.</li>
            <li>it is very creamy and fine lines are less visible.</li>
            <li>I wear a lot of eye makeup when I go out and normally wear eye liner/mascara during the week.</li>
            <li>It said it was the new formula in their description but was really the old one</li>
            <li>It made my skin tight but didn&#x27;t smooth the skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have tried many eye creams and this is the only one that helps with the dark circles!</li>
            <li>I have exceptionally sensitive eyes, and this does not irritate them.  </li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t want to completely discourage people from trying it.</li>
            <li>But my skin has never been classified as sensitive. ...</li>
            <li>There is no magic eye cream so don&#x27;t bother looking for that here or elsewhere, but I do find that this consistently flattens the puff under my eyes pretty well</li>
            <li>Does not feel heavy at all and absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li>I had a major allergic reaction to something in these products.  </li>
            <li>so has to be several years old.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using another product other than this one.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend using another product other than this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 25 years old, and I&#x27;ve had baggy, dark circle, problems under my eyes for years.</li>
            <li> The puffiness is not completely gone</li>
            <li> On the second day the skin on under my eyes became pink.</li>
            <li> Was allergic to the other products in the line but use this one not only around my eyes but also by my mouth.</li>
            <li> Instantly erases wrinkles and eases the look of dark circles</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference on my dark circles I&#x27;ve been using it for a year now and my under eye circles look the same.</li>
            <li> It actually gets rid of the bag and the dark part from the inside out...</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> I will still try other items from this line, but maybe won&#x27;t purchase this one again.</li>
            <li> This is probably due to the Anti-Puffiness Agent which helps to minimize the appearance of puffiness around the eye area.</li>
            <li> Item made my face worse... totally broke out around my eyes and this was the only think I had changed in my regime.  </li>
            <li> then I was shocked by how quickly my face starting looking worse-in a few days.  </li>
            <li> Does not help with puffiness and dark circles.</li>
            <li> and it has helped my dark under eye circles</li>
            <li> This stuff is thick sticky and gross</li>
            <li> After one week of morning and night application the proper way, my wrinkles have been slowly disappearing.</li>
            <li> After using this product, the puffiness around her eyes has gone down.  </li>
            <li> but they are less noticeable than they were before.</li>
            <li> Wrinkles seem less visible,  eyes just seem brighter.</li>
            <li> Thumbs down!</li>
            <li> It works each day to make any puffiness around the eye area disappear in a few minutes and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> My under eye wrinkles had not improved even after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> but I use a green dot prepaid visa</li>
            <li> Slightly painful Red irritation all around my eyes on the 2nd day of use.</li>
            <li> Usually a philosophy girls</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again :-/</li>
            <li> It has made my eyes look less tired</li>
            <li> I used it for at least a month and then threw it out.  </li>
            <li> I do believe it helps make the skin appear smoother ( even if it&#x27;s subtle).</li>
            <li> but was never happy with their eye creams.  </li>
            <li> I believe that this product went bad due to the melon ingrediant.</li>
            <li> hate if my eyes water they end up stinging due to product...</li>
            <li> It was just a fail for me.</li>
            <li> expensive eye moisturizer</li>
            <li> That was, until I realized I was using the product wrong.</li>
            <li> I was WRONG.</li>
            <li> so if I ever have a horror story hopefully it won&#x27;t be so bad.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was initially disappointed in this product...</li>
            <li> I was completely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I received a free sample of this product and I am so glad that I didn&#x27;t spend any money on it.  It did absolutely nothing for my eyes.  I used it for at least a month and then threw it out.  It&#x27;s not even worth 3 bucks.</li>
            <li> This really works!  I&#x27;m over 50 and my eye brows aren&#x27;t as high as they used to be.  This Lifting Eye Cream actually works and although it requires daily use to maintain the effect, it makes a noticeable difference.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Not as good as several other brands, but not bad!!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this eye cream.</li>
            <li> Perfect eye moisturizer This is This is heaven in a bottle.  I use this once a day and at night along with the cleaning system.  It last all day until you re wash your face and retreat at night.  Does not feel heavy at all and absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li> Great product. I will use nothing else from now on. Really took away the fine lines.</li>
            <li> I have visibly noticed a big improvement in the skins firmness around my  eyes. Really great product!</li>
            <li> Hands down best eyecream ever. Instantly erases wrinkles and eases the look of dark circles which mine are pretty severe. Fast delivery. Great price.</li>
            <li> I really like this eye cream. I have exceptionally sensitive eyes, and this does not irritate them.  I do believe it helps make the skin appear smoother ( even if it&#x27;s subtle).</li>
            <li> It said it was the new formula in their description but was really the old one so has to be several years old. No longer made. I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well, but I think you need all the products as a combo to really see a difference</li>
            <li> Does not help with puffiness and dark circles.</li>
            <li> It works each day to make any puffiness around the eye area disappear in a few minutes and lasts all day. A great product.</li>
            <li> been using for about three weeks and it has helped my dark under eye circles</li>
            <li> I have tried many eye creams and this is the only one that helps with the dark circles! Love t! I ordered the whole set from the Cindy Crawford Meaningful Beauty and this is the only thing that I continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> This cream is excellent over the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I use morning and night after cleansing for the night.&lt;br /&gt;Many years ago a product said &#x27;do not use on lid&#x27; so....I put it on my lid.....&lt;br /&gt;Since then I have a droopy lid over 1 eye.&lt;br /&gt;This cream pulls it right up and stays for most of the day. Reapply if you must it does not cake.&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff!!</li>
            <li> I love meaningful beauty by Cindy Crawford.  As a matter of fact&amp;#60; i have been using her products for 7 years now and I m 56 and I look 38 people think that I am not telling the truth about my age.  But, all her products are radiant, soft and really works. You can see and feel the difference</li>
            <li> I use all the product from Cindy Crawford ... I love it , I feel good about it , I see a big difference&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this line for over a year now and I am very satisfied</li>
            <li> This lifting cream really works.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Was allergic to the other products in the line but use this one not only around my eyes but also by my mouth. I can see where fine lines have disappeared. Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> just started to use it so I need to see a difference in a month time, cream feel nice at night</li>
            <li> Like this, but not in love... I find the Kinerase eye cream gentler to the eye area.  I find using the Creme de Serum much more soothing to the eye area and would just use that instead, morning and night.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS! My favorite eyecream!</li>
            <li> I bought this REALLY anticipating something fantastic.  It&#x27;s ok.  I will still try other items from this line, but maybe won&#x27;t purchase this one again.</li>
            <li> Has not shown any improvement like they advertise.  Will continue to use and hopefully will see a difference soon</li>
            <li> Made my eyes sting. Love the creme De serum will just use that. This stuff is thick sticky and gross</li>
            <li> There is no magic eye cream so don&#x27;t bother looking for that here or elsewhere, but I do find that this consistently flattens the puff under my eyes pretty well and, so far, better than anything else I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve used a lot!</li>
            <li> Great product. Glad I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> Very good product, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it had really good reviews. I&#x27;m only 25 years old, and I&#x27;ve had baggy, dark circle, problems under my eyes for years. This product didn&#x27;t work for me at all, I used it for over a month with no results. Now I don&#x27;t want to completely discourage people from trying it. Like I said, it had great reviews, and different things work for different people. It was just a fail for me.</li>
            <li> Feels good but no results</li>
            <li> I wear a lot of eye makeup when I go out and normally wear eye liner/mascara during the week. I wanted something that would rejuvenate my eyes from all the product and scrubbing off the product. I&#x27;ve really liked this cream and I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week. It has made my eyes look less tired and I&#x27;ve liked the way the underneath of my eyes have shined in pictures. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a birthday gift for a friend.  She absolutely loves it!  After using this product, the puffiness around her eyes has gone down.  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Got this for my mom and she is very satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> First time I tried it, love it.  Usually a philosophy girls but was never happy with their eye creams.  Meaningful beauty works great</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eye cream, but I use it in combination with Estee Lauder Resilience eye cream.  The combination works well.  Do you also sell the Estee Lauder products?</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected. Other creams from target worked better on fine lines and puffiness. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again :-/</li>
            <li> Gets rid of puffy eyes, fine lines and even though I am 70 years old, no one ever can guess my age and that makes me feel pretty good.  People tell me I don&#x27;t even look 60.  Having no work done cosmetically I am proud to say I cannot live without MEANINGFUL BEAUTY!  Luv you Cindy!</li>
            <li> Nice hypoallergenic formula</li>
            <li> expensive eye moisturizer</li>
            <li> Consistently good product. I bought it for a friend who finds it that it works.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I expected but ok, I bought the Meaningful Beauty package on a trial, not as good as advertised.  The Eye Creme is the only thing that is any good.</li>
            <li> If anything, it made the wrinkles more visible.  It made my skin tight but didn&#x27;t smooth the skin around my eyes. I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product is great!!! Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I was initially disappointed in this product... My under eye wrinkles had not improved even after a few weeks. That was, until I realized I was using the product wrong. So for any of you gals out there not seeing results... Make sure you dab a good pea size under each eye but do not rub it in at all (which is what I was doing wrong) It will absorb on its on and you will start to see results pretty quickly. After one week of morning and night application the proper way, my wrinkles have been slowly disappearing. Can&#x27;t wait to see the results with continued use!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference on my dark circles I&#x27;ve been using it for a year now and my under eye circles look the same.</li>
            <li> It works as good as Roc, and olay</li>
            <li> Helps with lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li> Thumbs down! Cindy.. You must be doing something else because this stuff doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> It works! Definite improvement around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see a difference and it burns.</li>
            <li> Item made my face worse... totally broke out around my eyes and this was the only think I had changed in my regime.  Sorry meaningful beauty... you might work on most but not on me.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free in return for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The skin under my eyes are not as puffy since I started using this product. The puffiness is not completely gone but they are less noticeable than they were before. This is probably due to the Anti-Puffiness Agent which helps to minimize the appearance of puffiness around the eye area.</li>
            <li> D5 LINKED TO UTERINE CANCER. MY SISTER USED THIS AND DIED OF OVARIAN CANCER!!!!</li>
            <li> After using this for over a month my eyes seem younger looking.  Wrinkles seem less visible,  eyes just seem brighter. I am pleased with this purchase, but not the way it was just thrown into a box with the spa chemicals I also ordered.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything for me.  However, to be fair, I&#x27;ve only used it for about three weeks.  I will not buy again though.</li>
            <li> I used to think this was the best stuff on the market...then I tried the Vernal Eye Repair and Moisturizer.  It actually gets rid of the bag and the dark part from the inside out...I really noticed how good the Vernal actually was working when I switched back to Meaningful Beauty then I was shocked by how quickly my face starting looking worse-in a few days.  I&#x27;m done with MB and moved onto Vernal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 34 and have been using this along with proactiv  since I was 26.  I do not look a day over 25. This stuff is even great around my lips and for fine lines on my forehead.  I order from the manufacturer but I use a green dot prepaid visa so if I ever have a horror story hopefully it won&#x27;t be so bad.</li>
            <li> FIRST OBTAINED THIS WITH A SPECIAL TV SPECIAL BUT DIDN&#x27;T WANT OR NEED SOME OF THE PRODUCTS IN THE KIT.  LIKED THIS EYE CREAM WELL ENOUGH TO LOOK IT UP AND PURCHASE AND WILL BUY AGAIN</li>
            <li> for women of color this product is not for our skin type. I  am currently looking to see if Olay works beer.  I was completely disappointed.  after 1 week of use the dark circles look more pronounced. I highly recommend using another product other than this one.</li>
            <li> On the second day the skin on under my eyes became pink. The third day the skin was hurting, red looking, and swelled into big bags. I believe that this product went bad due to the melon ingrediant.</li>
            <li> I order this through Meaningful beauty call center. Paid twice as much... turns out I guess my skin couldn&#x27;t handle it. Slightly painful Red irritation all around my eyes on the 2nd day of use. It also cleared up in 2 days without use. But my skin has never been classified as sensitive. ...</li>
            <li> Seller sent out very fast.  Great product using for years.</li>
            <li> I ordered the whole meaningful beauty line and the other products were just ok and will not be re ordering them....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER the advanced eye wrinkle cream worked right away by smoothing the fine lines and crows feet under my eyes, I was impressed especially since the other products didn&#x27;t work, this worked the first time I used it, you can even feel the tingling...the consistency of this new formulated eye cream is great too...very smooth. I will be reordering this again. Pretty good for an infomercial product!</li>
            <li> I like being able to by this product without joining the &amp;#34;club&amp;#34;  I want to be able to order this when I want to and not when the &amp;#34;club&amp;#34; says I have to.</li>
            <li> I bought this, the serum, the eye lift cream and the night cream. After 1 day&#x27;s use, my face was red and I had welts all over my face!  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever get rid of the almost scar reddish brown marks on my upper cheeks that are still there.  I had a major allergic reaction to something in these products.  My skin can&#x27;t tolerate retin-A types of products, but this line isn&#x27;t supposed to have that, as I understand it. That&#x27;s why I thought I could use it.  I was WRONG.</li>
            <li> Really liked this product - it is very creamy and fine lines are less visible. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
