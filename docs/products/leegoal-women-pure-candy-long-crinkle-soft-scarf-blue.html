            <li>l love it, so soft and light weight.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The one I received is a pretty color though, but more the length of a headband only.</li>
            <li>The material is completely sheer (Looks like gauze) and is more of a turquoise in color too.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t have paid $1 for this if I had seen it first.</li>

            <li>Much nicer than I was expecting</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve misted it and twisted it up and the light material should re-shape fairly</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no way anyone older then five can do anything with this scarf.</li>
            <li>vibrant colors and very very soft.  </li>
            <li>No tag on the scarf, even though it was supposed to be new...</li>
            <li>so short, tiny and cheap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also much shorter than the model&#x27;s scarf, though it is definitely workable for an adult.  </li>
            <li>and when it came I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>Not near as full textured or as long.</li>
            <li>Also in the picture it was a pretty royal blue shade and the one I received was navy blue.</li>
            <li>The color on mine is pretty much exactly the same as the scarf photo, which makes it a little darker than the scarf on the model.  </li>
            <li>Not as long as it appears in the photo, and its a little itchy, but after you wash it, its just fine,</li>
            <li>Nice and long, thicker then expected actually helps provide a little warmth.</li>

            <li> The one I received is a very dark midnight blue and is very short, not long or lighter blue like the one pictured.  </li>
            <li> Not very soft either</li>
            <li> Was expecting what was in the picture: a long heavier looking scarf.</li>
            <li> Thinner than expected.</li>
            <li> The fabric is soft and thin enough not to look like a mountain around my neck.  </li>

            <li> It is short and thin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It shipped flat instead of twisted, so there&#x27;s not much in the way of crinkle.  </li>
            <li> Not as thick as I thought they would be, but I figured that since I got them for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> but I guess it wasn&#x27;t expensive</li>
            <li> Bad, bad, bad...</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s that bad)</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Received my scarf yesterday and was very disappointed.</li>

            <li> The color on mine is pretty much exactly the same as the scarf photo, which makes it a little darker than the scarf on the model.  It&#x27;s also much shorter than the model&#x27;s scarf, though it is definitely workable for an adult.  Longer would have been nicer, but for the price I can&#x27;t complain too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It shipped flat instead of twisted, so there&#x27;s not much in the way of crinkle.  I&#x27;ve misted it and twisted it up and the light material should re-shape fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re not expecting something to wrap twice around your neck and then reach below your waist, this scarf works.</li>
            <li> Smaller than it looks</li>
            <li> The fabric is soft and thin enough not to look like a mountain around my neck.  I like the length and the color is very nice.</li>
            <li> This scarf was nothing like the one pictured. Not near as full textured or as long. Very flimsy like a silk scarf. Also in the picture it was a pretty royal blue shade and the one I received was navy blue. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love the color and light weight of the fabric. Perfect pop of color for winter, or any time of the year.</li>
            <li> Not as long as it appears in the photo, and its a little itchy, but after you wash it, its just fine,</li>
            <li> I love the color and the texture!!!</li>
            <li> Bad, bad, bad...so short, tiny and cheap. Not at all what is advertised.This scarf was nothing like the one pictured.</li>
            <li> good for the price super shirt though..... u should prob chang the photos..</li>
            <li> love it.  Much nicer than I was expecting</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way anyone older then five can do anything with this scarf. Not very soft either but I guess it wasn&#x27;t expensive so I gave to my daughter</li>
            <li> i love it, it is just as described, and i would recommend to all my friends.</li>
            <li> l love it, so soft and light weight.</li>
            <li> Thinner than expected.</li>
            <li> the price was right !!!!! it is nice and soft !!</li>
            <li> The scarf that arrived is not he same scarf in the picture.  The one I received is a very dark midnight blue and is very short, not long or lighter blue like the one pictured.  The one I received is a pretty color though, but more the length of a headband only.</li>
            <li> I love the color, feel and price. Worth every penny. I would suggest washing before use, dyes feel tacky. Great!</li>
            <li> just what my grand daughter wanted color fantastic.  thank you</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scarf. Out of the 10 that were purchased. I love this scarf!</li>
            <li> Not as thick as I thought they would be, but I figured that since I got them for a cheaper price. I like how long they are and I am happy with them. Most of them are going to be xmas presents so hopefully they like them. Would o gave a 5 but since thiner then what I thought.</li>
            <li> I loved the scarf, and the color was just like the picture!</li>
            <li> It was okay but the price was amazing !</li>
            <li> vibrant colors and very very soft.  I actually forgot I ordered it and when it came I was pleasantly surprised.  I love scarfs and this is a nice addition to my collection.  It is big enough to wear with my winter coat or wear as an all day accessory</li>
            <li> love the scarf. True to color in picture. very good value but took a very long time to get it.</li>
            <li> Received my scarf yesterday and was very disappointed. Was expecting what was in the picture: a long heavier looking scarf. Instead I received a short thin scarf. Not happy.</li>
            <li> I would skip buying this scarf, even for $2!! Does not even look anything close to what the picture shows! It&#x27;s really short(no way you could wear it as it is advertised) The material is completely sheer (Looks like gauze) and is more of a turquoise in color too. Really cheaply made. I wouldn&#x27;t have paid $1 for this if I had seen it first. (It&#x27;s that bad) You definitely get what you pay for, as they say.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely scarf. I work in a cold office, and it keeps my neck warm, which keeps the rest of me from being chilled.  It is a lovely shade of blue with nice crinkles.</li>
            <li> Great product and customer service</li>
            <li> misleading product image is not the color that looks and wanted and material</li>
            <li> Color is a royal blue. It is short and thin. It looks ok but does not keep you warm.</li>
            <li> Nice and long, thicker then expected actually helps provide a little warmth.</li>
            <li> No tag on the scarf, even though it was supposed to be new...</li>
