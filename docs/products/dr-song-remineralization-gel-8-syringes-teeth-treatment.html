            <li>Use it just before bed, don&#x27;t remove it and sleep with it all night long for the best results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li>You can really feel a good difference when used after whitening treatment.</li>
            <li>I got these because I heard remineralization was good for your teeth after whitening, but I cannot really tell if anything is happening.</li>
            <li>It really helps and I&#x27;m so glad I opted for it now!</li>
            <li>I purchased this product primarily to combat the sensitivity I experience when attempting to whiten my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I was given this free to review with the teeth whitening kit.</li>
            <li>IRecieved this product FREE for Reviewing Purposes From Tomoson.com &amp; i</li>
            <li>m glad I was chosen because I love this product I was so scared to do it as everyone was saying stuff like sensetivity to the teeth,but glad to say I never had a problem with sensitive teeth or pain.</li>
            <li>Too light, it won&#x27;t budge.  </li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>The gel also has a nice fresh mint flavor, so it leaves you with protected teeth and minty fresh breath.  </li>
            <li>so far it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>i was sceptical at first but after the second time i started seeing results and iam happy with the product and my teeth are whiter better than going to the dentist</li>
            <li>Dr. Songâ€™s kit is very easy to use it works very well.</li>
            <li>I got to try this free for review purposes and it really improved the health of my teeth especially with so many products out there doing things that hurt your teeth, this is super high quality and wonderful!</li>
            <li>I still have some sensitivity in certain spots, but maybe after I use it more it will help.</li>
            <li>and I am happy about that because I could not imagine my teeth being even more sensitive than they are currently.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I could&#x27;ve done without because the whitening kit doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive to the point to where I&#x27;d need remineralization gel.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take the full zing out of my teeth, but there is a substantial difference.  </li>
            <li>Received product quickly and everything was accounted for.</li>
            <li>When it comes to the application process when using the remineralization gel you want to be extra cautious when applying the gel and try to avoid getting it on your gums because along with reading Dr. Song&#x27;s instructions I have also read several reviews where they state that after getting the gel on their gums they felt irritation and some even experienced gum color change which is temporary but still, please be cautious!  </li>
            <li>Now, there&#x27;s a success story.</li>
            <li>My honest opinion of this item is that it really did work to keep my teeth from feeling sensitive after the whitening kit.</li>
            <li>When I recieved the Dr. Song proffesional teeth whitening kit complimentary for my review, I opted to use the mineralizer gel along with it.</li>
            <li>This package is only $9.99 and a great addition to use with the Dr Song Professional Teeth Whitening Kit.</li>
            <li>So glad that I can give myself professional fluoride treatments at home, when and if I feel the need for them.</li>
            <li>However, the product works and is worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>and I use this right after whitening</li>
            <li>I noticed right away</li>
            <li>My smile has never been whiter and my teeth have never been happier.  ; )  </li>
            <li>This helps prevent your teeth from becoming overly sensitive to the product.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s the important part, but I would much rather spend the money on the whitening strips as they are so much easier to use.</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t beat that I can honestly say that I definitely recommend buying this kit.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy a strong professional grade teeth whitening gel kit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You don&#x27;t need very much for a treatment, maybe 1/2 a ml.</li>
            <li>This does a fantastic job at keeping my teeth from getting sensitive after a whitening treatment.</li>
            <li>For me it was my first time trying this</li>
            <li>I received this for free for review purpose.&lt;br /&gt;Along with using the whitening, I have also used the remineralization gels that are recommended if you are using whitening product for the first time or tend to have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now able to use Whitestrips as directed by following each session with an application of Dr. Song Remineralization Gel as directed.  </li>
            <li>I tried this product and after using only 3 of the syringes my teeth were many shades whiter and people immediately noticed.  </li>
            <li>The Dr. Song remineralization gel does its job very well!</li>
            <li>I recommend this to use if it&#x27;s your first time using a whitening system.</li>
            <li>They have always been prone to unexpected enamel cracking and deterioration, irregardless of fluoride toothpastes, remineralization oral rinses or a strict sugar free diet.</li>
            <li>Wish I had been able to use this product for my entire life.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few sessions and got good results.</li>
            <li>In my opinion I believe this kit is amazing because you get to achieve a great white smile without the sensitivity  or the expensive price tag.</li>
            <li>The treatment left my teeth whiter and feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>So, even better it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li>My teeth are super sensitive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this product one time and it seemed fine.  </li>
            <li>I received this foe free in exchange for my personal opinion</li>
            <li>Looks as if it came straight from my dentist.</li>
            <li>Really does help with my gum sensitivity.</li>
            <li>by allison adams i am rating this dr song whitening system a 4 i have used it now a couple of times and iam very impresses</li>
            <li>I had gotten the teeth whitening kit sent to me for review, which I did really end up liking.</li>
            <li>However, I feel this product didn&#x27;t help me with sensitivity much.</li>
            <li>The Remineralization was really beneficial and helped with my teeth sensitivity and prepared them for the whitening.  </li>
            <li>this stuff really worked for me</li>
            <li>thanks for the Dr Song Remineralization Gel 8 Syringes</li>
            <li>and the SUPPER Fast Shipping</li>
            <li>It seems to work really well.</li>
            <li>It really helps with the sensitivity that you have on your teeth</li>
            <li>and it really helps with any whitening associated pain.</li>
            <li>Item arrived fast, but did not help with teeth whitening sensitivity.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see much change.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to state that this gel DOESN&#x27;T whiten</li>
            <li>I am so thrilled that I could finally achieve (almost) Colgate commercial pearly whites without the irration and sensitivity!  </li>
            <li>good value, however I wondered if it was diluted because the viscosity was not as thick as some of the others I had bought.</li>
            <li>If you suffer with sensitive teeth -- or if sensitive teeth have prevented you from whitening your smile -- Dr. Song&#x27;s Remineralization Gel can help!</li>
            <li>exactly as advertised, works well - really helps with sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>but  I have high hopes...</li>
            <li>This is so much easier to use and not messy to put in the liners.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Nothing was missing and everything was packaged well and sealed up safely.</li>
            <li>First, if you suffer from sensitive teeth and this is from anything from daily sensitivity to cold/hot drinks or maybe you are new to whitening methods, I highly suggest to first purchase Dr. Song&#x27;s &amp;#34;Remineralization&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>His teeth are looking so good at least 2 or 3 shades different</li>
            <li>My teeth are naturally very sensitive, so after each whitening treatment, I use this.</li>
            <li>My teeth are very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>so my teeth are very sensitive.</li>
            <li>Have very sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>After whitening my teeth they are normally very sensitive.</li>
            <li>, I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I saw this on the suggested buy list as well and decided to give it a try because I have very sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using whitening strips and my teeth are very sensitive</li>
            <li>Although, there was a slight difference in the appearance of color, it was hardly significant enough to deem the product a success.</li>
            <li>However, I did an overnight remineralization and my teeth were sensitive no longer!</li>
            <li>just don&#x27;t like the product for my sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to their teeth whiting gel</li>
            <li>Truly saves hundreds of dollars by doing this at home, rather than going to the dentist for a professional one time treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far product is working as advertised.</li>
            <li>This goes with the Dr. Song teeth whitening kit, this is a must if you have sensitive teeth because it prevents any tooth pain associated with the whitening process.</li>
            <li>This do work when your trying the Dr Song Home Professional Teeth Whitening.</li>
            <li>and i do have sensitive teeth and this work for me.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>No sensitivity issues so far.</li>
            <li>I still felt like my teeth and gums were sensitive after using it.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive teeth and want to whiten your teeth, try this.</li>
            <li>are way to sensitive for the kit even with the Dr Song Remineralization  to reduce sensitivity .</li>
            <li>It reduces teeth sensitivity during teeth whitening, restores vital minerals and vitamins to your teeth, and helps strengthen tooth enamel and prevent cavities with Sodium Fluoride and Potassium Nitrate.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>Song Home Professional Teeth</li>
            <li>So sensitive, that I can&#x27;t eat ice cream.  </li>
            <li>I have really sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any problems so far with sensitive places.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone with sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can also use the product after whitening if you get any sensitive spots.  </li>
            <li>Seemed to work after whitening, since my teeth didn&#x27;t feel sensitive  </li>
            <li>so far-</li>
            <li>the dentist always wants to charge me extra for the gel treatments on my visits.</li>
            <li>waste- especially because it just causes more air bubbles.</li>
            <li>For the first time I tried it I only left it on 30 min and to my surprise</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried this twice so far, but it does seem to help my sensitive teeth after my whitening treatment.</li>
            <li>This means the enamel has never been as strong or as thick as it should have been.  </li>
            <li>Although I was skeptical, I decided to give this Dr. Song product a try -- and boy, am I ever glad I did!  </li>
            <li>Trust me when I say that I have such sensitive teeth that I cannot eat ice chips or bite into ice cream!</li>
            <li>After using 2 of the 8 syringes, I cannot really tell any difference in the sensitivity of my teeth, which is a bit of a let-down since I had such high hopes after reading some other reviews.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive teeth, you will definitely want to add this to your whitening routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely helped my sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>Have had no further issues with unexpected enamel chips since regularly using gel.</li>
            <li>Then, if you have sensitive teeth, you have to use the re-mineralization gel, which just means more wearing of the uncomfortable trays.</li>
            <li>Generally I just suck back up what I don&#x27;t need</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Well, man, i gotta say this stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Granted, I have to use more of it than suggested or else it doesn&#x27;t cover my teeth.</li>
            <li> Clean the trays with warm water and</li>
            <li> Use it just before bed, don&#x27;t remove it and sleep with it all night long for the best results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> You can really feel a good difference when used after whitening treatment.</li>
            <li> I got these because I heard remineralization was good for your teeth after whitening, but I cannot really tell if anything is happening.</li>
            <li> It really helps and I&#x27;m so glad I opted for it now!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product primarily to combat the sensitivity I experience when attempting to whiten my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I was given this free to review with the teeth whitening kit.</li>
            <li> IRecieved this product FREE for Reviewing Purposes From Tomoson.com &amp; i</li>
            <li> m glad I was chosen because I love this product I was so scared to do it as everyone was saying stuff like sensetivity to the teeth,but glad to say I never had a problem with sensitive teeth or pain.</li>
            <li> Too light, it won&#x27;t budge.  </li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> The gel also has a nice fresh mint flavor, so it leaves you with protected teeth and minty fresh breath.  </li>
            <li> so far it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> i was sceptical at first but after the second time i started seeing results and iam happy with the product and my teeth are whiter better than going to the dentist</li>
            <li> Dr. Songâ€™s kit is very easy to use it works very well.</li>
            <li> I got to try this free for review purposes and it really improved the health of my teeth especially with so many products out there doing things that hurt your teeth, this is super high quality and wonderful!</li>
            <li> I still have some sensitivity in certain spots, but maybe after I use it more it will help.</li>
            <li> and I am happy about that because I could not imagine my teeth being even more sensitive than they are currently.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I could&#x27;ve done without because the whitening kit doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive to the point to where I&#x27;d need remineralization gel.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take the full zing out of my teeth, but there is a substantial difference.  </li>
            <li> Received product quickly and everything was accounted for.</li>
            <li> When it comes to the application process when using the remineralization gel you want to be extra cautious when applying the gel and try to avoid getting it on your gums because along with reading Dr. Song&#x27;s instructions I have also read several reviews where they state that after getting the gel on their gums they felt irritation and some even experienced gum color change which is temporary but still, please be cautious!  </li>
            <li> Now, there&#x27;s a success story.</li>
            <li> My honest opinion of this item is that it really did work to keep my teeth from feeling sensitive after the whitening kit.</li>
            <li> When I recieved the Dr. Song proffesional teeth whitening kit complimentary for my review, I opted to use the mineralizer gel along with it.</li>
            <li> This package is only $9.99 and a great addition to use with the Dr Song Professional Teeth Whitening Kit.</li>
            <li> So glad that I can give myself professional fluoride treatments at home, when and if I feel the need for them.</li>
            <li> However, the product works and is worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> and I use this right after whitening</li>
            <li> I noticed right away</li>
            <li> My smile has never been whiter and my teeth have never been happier.  ; )  </li>
            <li> This helps prevent your teeth from becoming overly sensitive to the product.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s the important part, but I would much rather spend the money on the whitening strips as they are so much easier to use.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t beat that I can honestly say that I definitely recommend buying this kit.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy a strong professional grade teeth whitening gel kit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You don&#x27;t need very much for a treatment, maybe 1/2 a ml.</li>
            <li> This does a fantastic job at keeping my teeth from getting sensitive after a whitening treatment.</li>
            <li> For me it was my first time trying this</li>
            <li> I received this for free for review purpose.&lt;br /&gt;Along with using the whitening, I have also used the remineralization gels that are recommended if you are using whitening product for the first time or tend to have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now able to use Whitestrips as directed by following each session with an application of Dr. Song Remineralization Gel as directed.  </li>
            <li> I tried this product and after using only 3 of the syringes my teeth were many shades whiter and people immediately noticed.  </li>
            <li> The Dr. Song remineralization gel does its job very well!</li>
            <li> I recommend this to use if it&#x27;s your first time using a whitening system.</li>
            <li> They have always been prone to unexpected enamel cracking and deterioration, irregardless of fluoride toothpastes, remineralization oral rinses or a strict sugar free diet.</li>
            <li> Wish I had been able to use this product for my entire life.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few sessions and got good results.</li>
            <li> In my opinion I believe this kit is amazing because you get to achieve a great white smile without the sensitivity  or the expensive price tag.</li>
            <li> The treatment left my teeth whiter and feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> So, even better it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> My teeth are super sensitive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product one time and it seemed fine.  </li>
            <li> I received this foe free in exchange for my personal opinion</li>
            <li> Looks as if it came straight from my dentist.</li>
            <li> Really does help with my gum sensitivity.</li>
            <li> by allison adams i am rating this dr song whitening system a 4 i have used it now a couple of times and iam very impresses</li>
            <li> I had gotten the teeth whitening kit sent to me for review, which I did really end up liking.</li>
            <li> However, I feel this product didn&#x27;t help me with sensitivity much.</li>
            <li> The Remineralization was really beneficial and helped with my teeth sensitivity and prepared them for the whitening.  </li>
            <li> this stuff really worked for me</li>
            <li> thanks for the Dr Song Remineralization Gel 8 Syringes</li>
            <li> and the SUPPER Fast Shipping</li>
            <li> It seems to work really well.</li>
            <li> It really helps with the sensitivity that you have on your teeth</li>
            <li> and it really helps with any whitening associated pain.</li>
            <li> Item arrived fast, but did not help with teeth whitening sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much change.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to state that this gel DOESN&#x27;T whiten</li>
            <li> I am so thrilled that I could finally achieve (almost) Colgate commercial pearly whites without the irration and sensitivity!  </li>
            <li> good value, however I wondered if it was diluted because the viscosity was not as thick as some of the others I had bought.</li>
            <li> If you suffer with sensitive teeth -- or if sensitive teeth have prevented you from whitening your smile -- Dr. Song&#x27;s Remineralization Gel can help!</li>
            <li> exactly as advertised, works well - really helps with sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> but  I have high hopes...</li>
            <li> This is so much easier to use and not messy to put in the liners.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Nothing was missing and everything was packaged well and sealed up safely.</li>
            <li> First, if you suffer from sensitive teeth and this is from anything from daily sensitivity to cold/hot drinks or maybe you are new to whitening methods, I highly suggest to first purchase Dr. Song&#x27;s &amp;#34;Remineralization&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> His teeth are looking so good at least 2 or 3 shades different</li>
            <li> My teeth are naturally very sensitive, so after each whitening treatment, I use this.</li>
            <li> My teeth are very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> so my teeth are very sensitive.</li>
            <li> Have very sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> After whitening my teeth they are normally very sensitive.</li>
            <li> , I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I saw this on the suggested buy list as well and decided to give it a try because I have very sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using whitening strips and my teeth are very sensitive</li>
            <li> Although, there was a slight difference in the appearance of color, it was hardly significant enough to deem the product a success.</li>
            <li> However, I did an overnight remineralization and my teeth were sensitive no longer!</li>
            <li> just don&#x27;t like the product for my sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to their teeth whiting gel</li>
            <li> Truly saves hundreds of dollars by doing this at home, rather than going to the dentist for a professional one time treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far product is working as advertised.</li>
            <li> This goes with the Dr. Song teeth whitening kit, this is a must if you have sensitive teeth because it prevents any tooth pain associated with the whitening process.</li>
            <li> This do work when your trying the Dr Song Home Professional Teeth Whitening.</li>
            <li> and i do have sensitive teeth and this work for me.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> No sensitivity issues so far.</li>
            <li> I still felt like my teeth and gums were sensitive after using it.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth and want to whiten your teeth, try this.</li>
            <li> are way to sensitive for the kit even with the Dr Song Remineralization  to reduce sensitivity .</li>
            <li> It reduces teeth sensitivity during teeth whitening, restores vital minerals and vitamins to your teeth, and helps strengthen tooth enamel and prevent cavities with Sodium Fluoride and Potassium Nitrate.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> Song Home Professional Teeth</li>
            <li> So sensitive, that I can&#x27;t eat ice cream.  </li>
            <li> I have really sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems so far with sensitive places.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can also use the product after whitening if you get any sensitive spots.  </li>
            <li> Seemed to work after whitening, since my teeth didn&#x27;t feel sensitive  </li>
            <li> so far-</li>
            <li> the dentist always wants to charge me extra for the gel treatments on my visits.</li>
            <li> waste- especially because it just causes more air bubbles.</li>
            <li> For the first time I tried it I only left it on 30 min and to my surprise</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried this twice so far, but it does seem to help my sensitive teeth after my whitening treatment.</li>
            <li> This means the enamel has never been as strong or as thick as it should have been.  </li>
            <li> Although I was skeptical, I decided to give this Dr. Song product a try -- and boy, am I ever glad I did!  </li>
            <li> Trust me when I say that I have such sensitive teeth that I cannot eat ice chips or bite into ice cream!</li>
            <li> After using 2 of the 8 syringes, I cannot really tell any difference in the sensitivity of my teeth, which is a bit of a let-down since I had such high hopes after reading some other reviews.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth, you will definitely want to add this to your whitening routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely helped my sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> Have had no further issues with unexpected enamel chips since regularly using gel.</li>
            <li> Then, if you have sensitive teeth, you have to use the re-mineralization gel, which just means more wearing of the uncomfortable trays.</li>
            <li> Generally I just suck back up what I don&#x27;t need</li>
            <li> If your teeth are less sensitive you may find you only need to use this</li>
            <li> It helps with making teeth less sensitive after whitening and gives back mineralization to the teeth.</li>
            <li> I could not really tell a big difference</li>
            <li> The whitening product that works best for me, Crest Whitestrips,  (unfortunately) made my teeth hypersensitive to the point of being painful.  </li>
            <li> It only takes very little product at a time so the eight tubes will last me awhile.</li>
            <li> I only had to use this a few times before I could do the teeth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried molding the trays over and over and they would only print your teeth and not fit snug to the gum.</li>
            <li> Timely arrival and all as expected.  </li>
            <li> I have to sleep with a mouth guard because of bruxism and often have white spots on my teeth because of them being dried out overnight.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re teeth, and the people saying so are not real customers.</li>
            <li> On occasions I&#x27;d have sharp pain in my teeth</li>
            <li> This product is extremely good,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks and have not experienced any extra sensitivity</li>
            <li> I tried others with no success.  </li>
            <li> Thoroughly rinse your trays and apply a very small amount to the front and back of the trays.</li>
            <li> I gave the remaining product (less 2 treatments) to one of my sons.  </li>
            <li> No longer hurting when eating/drinking cold or hot food/drink.</li>
            <li> My teeth do not really burn after whitening, but they are sensitive to cold.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the reason I gave it one star less!</li>
            <li> Too hard too, squirt half of it out.  </li>
            <li> Not very effective.</li>
            <li> I have heavy decalcification from braces when I was a teen, which makes teeth whitening difficult.</li>
            <li> Ill have to come back and review.</li>
            <li> It is that bad, but with this remineralization gel, my teeth do not feel sensitive to it</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical, but after only a couple treatments I can&#x27;t imagine whitening without it!</li>
            <li> Also, even going slow and very carefully, I have a horrible issue with air bubbles and such making it ooze out half of the syringe at a time!</li>
            <li> (No Good)</li>
            <li> that well so after all that time my teeth have a yellow look to them which I HATE</li>
            <li> The syringes are difficult to push.  </li>
            <li> The results were disappointing.  </li>
            <li> and I was afraid the gel would too.</li>
            <li> make my teeth hurt so badly</li>
            <li> It was gawd awful painful.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is so much easier to use and not messy to put in the liners.&lt;br /&gt;I just don&#x27;t like the product for my sensitive teeth but if your teeth can adjust to anything, it&#x27;s a must have with the kit!</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to their teeth whiting gel this helps</li>
            <li> This does a fantastic job at keeping my teeth from getting sensitive after a whitening treatment. My teeth are naturally very sensitive, so after each whitening treatment, I use this. If your teeth are less sensitive you may find you only need to use this occasionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Dr Song Home Professional Teeth Whitening Kit, and this kit goes perfectly with that one. 50 uses with the entire set. Truly saves hundreds of dollars by doing this at home, rather than going to the dentist for a professional one time treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>

            <li> This goes with the Dr. Song teeth whitening kit, this is a must if you have sensitive teeth because it prevents any tooth pain associated with the whitening process. The actual kit worked very well for me, my teeth were whiter within just a few sessions.</li>

            <li> by allison adams i am rating this dr song whitening system a 4 i have used it now a couple of times and iam very impresses i was sceptical at first but after the second time i started seeing results and iam happy with the product and my teeth are whiter better than going to the dentist</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I recomend it.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a must have if you use Dr. Song&#x27;s teeth whitening kit. I have sensitive teeth and I use this right after whitening and it&#x27;s been great. No sensitivity issues so far.</li>
            <li> I thought this product was just ok. I had gotten the teeth whitening kit sent to me for review, which I did really end up liking. However, I feel this product didn&#x27;t help me with sensitivity much. I still felt like my teeth and gums were sensitive after using it. I&#x27;ll keep using this though and see if I can use it better somehow</li>
            <li> I only had to use this a few times before I could do the teeth Whitening without it! It works. If you have sensitive teeth and want to whiten your teeth, try this. Dr.  Song sent me this for testing purposes and to try and review on my blog and it works to stop the sensitivity of your teeth!</li>
            <li> Dr. Songâ€™s kit is very easy to use it works very well. I&#x27;ve tried a few sessions and got good results. I honestly the whitening process was amazing. However, the trays are not sturdy. I&#x27;ve tried molding the trays over and over and they would only print your teeth and not fit snug to the gum. On occasions I&#x27;d have sharp pain in my teeth (No Good) Just make sure not to get it on your gums as it will make them burn it could be my teeth are way to sensitive for the kit even with the Dr Song Remineralization  to reduce sensitivity . This kit was not for me  but my husband got amazing results. His teeth are looking so good at least 2 or 3 shades different and he has not had any sensitivity</li>
            <li> I got the opportunity to try this Remineralization Gel Treatment with Dr Song&#x27;s Teeth Whitening System. This does a great job desensitizing your teeth. I could not be happier! The treatment left my teeth whiter and feeling clean and fresh. This gel helped the whitening process even more. If you have sensitive teeth, you will definitely want to add this to your whitening routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr Song Remineralization Teeth Treatments includes....&lt;br /&gt;8 Syringes good for 50 treatments&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remineralization teeth treatment is recommend to use with teeth whitening products to desensitize teeth during treatment. It reduces teeth sensitivity during teeth whitening, restores vital minerals and vitamins to your teeth, and helps strengthen tooth enamel and prevent cavities with Sodium Fluoride and Potassium Nitrate. This also helps your teeth to stay whiter after whitening treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This remineralization gel is used after the whitening process has been completed. Thoroughly rinse your trays and apply a very small amount to the front and back of the trays. Leave the trays in your mouth as needed from 30 minutes to 4 hours. Then remove the trays and do not rinse your mouth. Clean the trays with warm water and a toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Water, Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Carbomer, Potassium Sorbate, Potassium Nitrate, Mentha Piperita Oil, Dicalcium Phosphate Dihydrate, Dicalcium Posphate, Flouride&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion. Regardless, I only recommend product that I would personally use myself.</li>
            <li> Definitely helped my sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> Timely arrival and all as expected.  Product seems to work well for desensitizing.  I will be reordering this.</li>
            <li> This product is extremely good,&lt;br /&gt;I had no sensitivity  after whitening my teeth</li>
            <li> one use. so far so good.</li>
            <li> Dr Song Teeth Whitening was not a winner for me.  My teeth are very sensitive.  Even after using the remineralization gel my teeth were hurting. It was gawd awful painful.  I can&#x27;t blame the product for MY sensitivities however.  I CAN when it comes to effectiveness, or lack there of, in this case.  I gave the remaining product (less 2 treatments) to one of my sons.  He was diligent about how he went about whitening his teeth following instructions to the letter.  The results were disappointing.  Although, there was a slight difference in the appearance of color, it was hardly significant enough to deem the product a success. In the end, I purchased Crest Whitening Strips for my son.  Now, there&#x27;s a success story.</li>
            <li> Apply after whitening and your teeth feel so good! There&#x27;s no sensitivity to the teeth or gums. Its minty and refreshing!</li>
            <li> exactly as advertised, works well - really helps with sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product z...</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing</li>
            <li> My wife like this product</li>
            <li> I received this for free for review purpose.&lt;br /&gt;Along with using the whitening, I have also used the remineralization gels that are recommended if you are using whitening product for the first time or tend to have sensitive teeth. This you need to use after using the whitening.</li>
            <li> Kinda worked. Made teeth dyed blue for like an hour. Had to brush to get rid of.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product primarily to combat the sensitivity I experience when attempting to whiten my teeth.  The whitening product that works best for me, Crest Whitestrips,  (unfortunately) made my teeth hypersensitive to the point of being painful.  Although I was skeptical, I decided to give this Dr. Song product a try -- and boy, am I ever glad I did!  I&#x27;m now able to use Whitestrips as directed by following each session with an application of Dr. Song Remineralization Gel as directed.  My smile has never been whiter and my teeth have never been happier.  ; )  This product is great and does exactly what it promises to do.  If you suffer with sensitive teeth -- or if sensitive teeth have prevented you from whitening your smile -- Dr. Song&#x27;s Remineralization Gel can help!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be honest here- this stuff was such a pain in the butt to apply, but it does work.&lt;br /&gt;You have to squeeze a tiny amount out of a syringe into a cup or a tray of some sort and then &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; each individual tooth with the gel with a microscopic paint brush. The trays are kind of a pain to wear as well. I drooled. A lot. Then, if you have sensitive teeth, you have to use the re-mineralization gel, which just means more wearing of the uncomfortable trays. This stuff did whiten my teeth quite a bit, however I only got halfway through the amount of treatments I had before I just threw in the towel and gave up- The product works, that&#x27;s the important part, but I would much rather spend the money on the whitening strips as they are so much easier to use.</li>
            <li> You can really feel a good difference when used after whitening treatment. I have not had any sensitivity using it in this way.</li>
            <li> I havent experienced any pain so it seems to be doing its job</li>
            <li> I have started using this product a week ago with my whitening kit and it makes a difference when used together. I have sensitive teeth so this product helps with not letting the whitening kit affect my teeth or gums. Glad I recieved this product to follow up with the teeth whitening kit. It only takes very little product at a time so the eight tubes will last me awhile.</li>
            <li> My teeth are super sensitive. I was given this free to review with the teeth whitening kit. My honest opinion of this item is that it really did work to keep my teeth from feeling sensitive after the whitening kit. I dont know what I would have done without this stuff. yeah I do, I wouldnt have used the whitening kit!</li>
            <li> Arrived as described. I got this in combination with the &amp;#34;Dr Song Home Professional Teeth Whitening 44% Carbamide Peroxide 8 XL Syringe Kit with Light&amp;#34;. Honestly, I could&#x27;ve done without because the whitening kit doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive to the point to where I&#x27;d need remineralization gel. But I may need it in the future.</li>
            <li> Dr Song sent me the Remineralization Gel along with the Teeth Whitening system to review for my GlamRiver blog.  The Remineralization was really beneficial and helped with my teeth sensitivity and prepared them for the whitening.  The Remineralization also helps strengthen enamel which is also something I need as well.  I think this product is great if you are thinking about doing any teeth whitening OR even if you just need to reduce teeth sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I tried others with no success.  I tried this product and after using only 3 of the syringes my teeth were many shades whiter and people immediately noticed.  Just purchased a second set for my wife.  It works better than advertised.</li>
            <li> So for the last year I haven&#x27;t been brushing my teeth that well so after all that time my teeth have a yellow look to them which I HATE so that led me to look for teeth whitening solutions. After testing out many different methods I have come to the conclusion that Dr Song Remineralization Gel is the best one out of them all. I recommend everyone use this as it is amazing!!!</li>
            <li> good value, however I wondered if it was diluted because the viscosity was not as thick as some of the others I had bought.</li>
            <li> IRecieved this product FREE for Reviewing Purposes From Tomoson.com &amp; im glad I was chosen because I love this product I was so scared to do it as everyone was saying stuff like sensetivity to the teeth,but glad to say I never had a problem with sensitive teeth or pain.For the first time I tried it I only left it on 30 min and to my surprise my teeth were whiter.I like this product and in my experiance it works.I will purchase again!!</li>
            <li> I have whitened my teeth for years with off the shelf brand whiteners so my teeth are very sensitive. When I recieved the Dr. Song proffesional teeth whitening kit complimentary for my review, I opted to use the mineralizer gel along with it. I applied the mineralizer gel as per instructions and continued to the whitening process. I noticed right away i had no sensitivity. In fact, I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks and have not experienced any extra sensitivity and I really think it has even helped with some of the sensitivity I had before, if you have trouble with sensitivity from whitening,  I suggest this mineralizing kit in addition to the whitening kit. It really helps and I&#x27;m so glad I opted for it now!</li>
            <li> Thinking about buying the teeth whitener? Add this to your shopping cart too and remineralise your teeth after whitening!!</li>
            <li> I depend on this stuff.  Have very sensitive teeth.  So sensitive, that I can&#x27;t eat ice cream.  This is much better than those crest strips.  I had a reaction to the crest brand.  This product is good.</li>
            <li> This  kit is amazing..... Buy it together with the 44% whitening set. Very good combo!</li>
            <li> this stuff really worked for me</li>
            <li> Another hit for Dr. Song.</li>
            <li> thanks for the Dr Song Remineralization Gel 8 Syringes Very Pleased with the product.... and the SUPPER Fast Shipping</li>
            <li> Easy to use and effective for remineralizing!</li>
            <li> Simply ... Amazing!!! A+</li>
            <li> The Dr. Song remineralization gel does its job very well! After whitening my teeth they are normally very sensitive. However, I did an overnight remineralization and my teeth were sensitive no longer! The gel does not taste very good so try your best to not let it touch your tongue, but the gel does a very good job and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need very much for a treatment, maybe 1/2 a ml. So, even better it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> I used this after using the dr song&#x27;s whitening teeth kit. It helps with making teeth less sensitive after whitening and gives back mineralization to the teeth. I recommend this to use if it&#x27;s your first time using a whitening system. I received this product after exchange of my honest opinions.</li>
            <li> I got to try this Remineralization Gel Treatment along with the teeth whitening kit and I could not be happier! I am so thrilled that I could finally achieve (almost) Colgate commercial pearly whites without the irration and sensitivity!  Buying this remineralization gel is the best thing you can do for yourself if you have never used a whitening kit before or have sensitive teeth like me. This helps prevent your teeth from becoming overly sensitive to the product. It restores minerals and helps strengthen enamel as well! Trust me when I say that I have such sensitive teeth that I cannot eat ice chips or bite into ice cream! It is that bad, but with this remineralization gel, my teeth do not feel sensitive to it and I am happy about that because I could not imagine my teeth being even more sensitive than they are currently. When it comes to the application process when using the remineralization gel you want to be extra cautious when applying the gel and try to avoid getting it on your gums because along with reading Dr. Song&#x27;s instructions I have also read several reviews where they state that after getting the gel on their gums they felt irritation and some even experienced gum color change which is temporary but still, please be cautious!  In my opinion I believe this kit is amazing because you get to achieve a great white smile without the sensitivity  or the expensive price tag. This package is only $9.99 and a great addition to use with the Dr Song Professional Teeth Whitening Kit. You really can&#x27;t beat that I can honestly say that I definitely recommend buying this kit.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive teeth. When I use their teeth whitening system I use one of these after. It seems to work really well. I haven&#x27;t had any problems so far with sensitive places. I would recommend this to anyone with sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> First, if you suffer from sensitive teeth and this is from anything from daily sensitivity to cold/hot drinks or maybe you are new to whitening methods, I highly suggest to first purchase Dr. Song&#x27;s &amp;#34;Remineralization&amp;#34; Gel kit.  The kit provides a gel that, which reduces tooth sensitivity.  Your teeth will also benefit from restoration of minerals, strengthening of enamel with Sodium Fluoride and Potassium Nitrate.  One kit provides you with 8 syringes, which gives you 50 treatments! The gel also has a nice fresh mint flavor, so it leaves you with protected teeth and minty fresh breath.  You can also use the product after whitening if you get any sensitive spots.  The product works just as described and delivered an ouch-free whitening experience!</li>
            <li> AS DESCRIBED!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My teeth are called &amp;#34;soft teeth&amp;#34;.  This means the enamel has never been as strong or as thick as it should have been.  They have always been prone to unexpected enamel cracking and deterioration, irregardless of fluoride toothpastes, remineralization oral rinses or a strict sugar free diet. This product has desensitized my teeth and appears to have strengthened the enamel. Have had no further issues with unexpected enamel chips since regularly using gel. Wish I had been able to use this product for my entire life.  What a difference it would have made.  Thank you Dr. Song!</li>
            <li> It really helps with the sensitivity that you have on your teeth and it goes away  awesome stuff</li>
            <li> I got these because I heard remineralization was good for your teeth after whitening, but I cannot really tell if anything is happening. My teeth do not really burn after whitening, but they are sensitive to cold. After using 2 of the 8 syringes, I cannot really tell any difference in the sensitivity of my teeth, which is a bit of a let-down since I had such high hopes after reading some other reviews.</li>
            <li> Seemed to work after whitening, since my teeth didn&#x27;t feel sensitive  (although the whitening kit doesn&#x27;t work great, so I&#x27;m not even sure if this is needed)</li>
            <li> http://sapphiresfamilyfriendlyreviews.weebly.com/home/dr-songs-teeth-whitening-system</li>
            <li> Removes the pain of sensitivity from teeth bleaching. Helpful to stop the sensitivity. It works. I bought it several times. Use it just before bed, don&#x27;t remove it and sleep with it all night long for the best results. Do not swallow it. Spit it out instead of swallowing it.</li>
            <li> Great companion for the teeth whitening gel. It&#x27;s got a minty smell/flavor and it really helps with any whitening associated pain.</li>
            <li> Works amazing to reduce/remove all irritation after a whitening. A must have for all at-home teeth whiteners!</li>
            <li> Item arrived fast, but did not help with teeth whitening sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I only used it once so far- so far it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Did not come with tray.  The syringes are difficult to push.  Too hard too, squirt half of it out.  Too light, it won&#x27;t budge.  Also This solution did not help with sensitivity but irritated gums.</li>
            <li> Not very effective. Didn&#x27;t see much change.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for the taste, it was similar to medicine. I have heavy decalcification from braces when I was a teen, which makes teeth whitening difficult. This product makes whitening for me possible on a nightly basis. It doesn&#x27;t take the full zing out of my teeth, but there is a substantial difference.  I was very skeptical, but after only a couple treatments I can&#x27;t imagine whitening without it!</li>
            <li> Excellent costumer service I very happy with the results plus it&#x27;s a convenience price for a great product</li>
            <li> So glad that I can give myself professional fluoride treatments at home, when and if I feel the need for them. I have to sleep with a mouth guard because of bruxism and often have white spots on my teeth because of them being dried out overnight. I need extra protection and the dentist always wants to charge me extra for the gel treatments on my visits.</li>
            <li> I received these in exchange for review. I thought they were okay. I could not really tell a big difference, I have very sensitive teeth so I don&#x27;t know if that may have effected it or not. They are a good idea though I think if you are having your teeth whitened as well.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy a strong professional grade teeth whitening gel kit. I saw this on the suggested buy list as well and decided to give it a try because I have very sensitive teeth. The white strips bought from drug stores make my teeth hurt so badly and I was afraid the gel would too. Well, man, i gotta say this stuff is fantastic! I love it. Granted, I have to use more of it than suggested or else it doesn&#x27;t cover my teeth. Also, even going slow and very carefully, I have a horrible issue with air bubbles and such making it ooze out half of the syringe at a time! Generally I just suck back up what I don&#x27;t need but it&#x27;s still a hassle and waste- especially because it just causes more air bubbles. That&#x27;s the reason I gave it one star less! However, the product works and is worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried this twice so far, but it does seem to help my sensitive teeth after my whitening treatment. I still have some sensitivity in certain spots, but maybe after I use it more it will help. Ill have to come back and review. The gel has a minty taste which is nice because I never had a whitening product taste good. I really wanted to state that this gel DOESN&#x27;T whiten you&#x27;re teeth, and the people saying so are not real customers. In the description it doesn&#x27;t even say this product will whiten teeth. I just wanted to state that so you don&#x27;t expect the product to do something it isn&#x27;t even suppose to do.</li>
            <li> It works after the first couple of applications and im extremely happy with my results</li>
            <li> Great product and service, thanks!</li>
            <li> great deal and quality</li>
            <li> it takes away the pain that i get after whitening my teeth. Its amazing!</li>
            <li> just started using but  I have high hopes...</li>
            <li> No longer hurting when eating/drinking cold or hot food/drink.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product one time and it seemed fine.  Will update later when I&#x27;ve used several times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using whitening strips and my teeth are very sensitive so that&#x27;s why I ordered this to help me but it doesn&#x27;t work.i think it depends on the persons teeth but it definitely didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
