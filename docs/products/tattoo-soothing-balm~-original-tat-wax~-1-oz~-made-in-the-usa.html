            <li>Absorbs quickly without feeling &#x27;greasy&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, a great steal for 4 bucks</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d say theres a VERY light scent.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li>stuff smelled better and did not break me out.</li>
            <li>I love this product, have used it before.  </li>
            <li>I love this, but it seems Amazon has a problem keeping it in stock</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>this product is simply genius the best product out there for after care</li>
            <li>great stuff my tats are healing ultra fast</li>
            <li>I will be getting more.and more after that.</li>
            <li>Healed my tattoo much better than lubriderm or cocoa butter ever has..</li>
            <li>Great product for my new tat!</li>
            <li>I go, more convenient than a huge conspicuous bottle of lotion</li>
            <li>I have tried other products and found, for me, this works best.</li>
            <li>I purchased it for $4 here on amazon, and for that price it was something I easily tossed in my shopping cart</li>
            <li>Was exactly what I wanted!!</li>
            <li>My tattoo heeled nicely and this is easy to carry with me and is all natural oils.  </li>
            <li>It works much better than skin lotions, healing time is much quicker.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it smells lightly sweet.</li>
            <li>Helps with itchiness that comes with a fresh tattoo.  </li>
            <li>consistency is light, and good for a thin layer on a freshly healing tattoo.</li>
            <li>I was told by an aquaintance to get this product on my Tat and it has helped my skin heal pretty well</li>
            <li>great for aftercare when getting new work done or just keeping things looking dark and bright, especially with my dry skin</li>
            <li>My favorite thing is how long it lasts.</li>
            <li>I love it and never leave home without it especially with my new tattoo healing</li>
            <li>I got it here for much cheaper than at the shop.</li>
            <li>This product helped keep my colors from fading so much.  </li>
            <li>Due to this the product lost the scent I enjoyed so much.  </li>
            <li>As always this product is terrific skin care for healing tattoos...keeps vibrant colors and skin smooth...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna start by saying I&#x27;ve been tattooed for many hours, and have tried just about all commercially available tattoo aftercare products, and quite a few lesser known aftercare salves and creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Soothing, cheap and enough for more then one small to medium tattoo..</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other tattoo balms and lotions but this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>I recommend using it for any new tats.</li>
            <li>can cuz I&#x27;m almost running out after getting a tattoo recently, and it&#x27;s the exact size I wanted and</li>
            <li>As a professional tattoo artist I advise everyone to use tattoo goo or just use a and d.</li>
            <li>of natural oils.</li>
            <li>I put it on long after the tattoo has healed, just to keep it moisturized and looking vibrant.</li>

            <li> then you can make this tiny can go a long way.</li>
            <li> , can&#x27;t say that about some other more expensive products.</li>
            <li> Lotions have so many ingredients in them, and of course I cant discern all the complicated names, most have fragrance anyway, or have oil in them which is bad for your tattoo.</li>
            <li> Not strong or identifiable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen this product in a few different tattoo shops but always avoided it because it looked how could i say &amp;#34;old fashioned and basic&amp;#34; for a tattoo balm.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It lasts longer and you don&#x27;t have to use as much as other balms.</li>
            <li> Could replace your other moisturizers even after the tattoo has healed up.</li>
            <li> balm has a very minimal scent, I know it says Unscented in the description</li>
            <li> Used this instead of the previous tattoo balm that broke me out.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Just sucks its a add on item:(</li>
            <li> With TatWax, I dont have to worry about all that crazy stuff.</li>
            <li> Finding a balm to use for aftercare is very tedious.</li>
            <li> Disappointed</li>
            <li> This product is horrible.</li>

            <li> You can&#x27;t beat this stuff for tattoo aftercare. It works much better than skin lotions, healing time is much quicker.</li>
            <li> great for aftercare when getting new work done or just keeping things looking dark and bright, especially with my dry skin</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve used other tattoo balms and lotions but this is by far my favorite. It lasts longer and you don&#x27;t have to use as much as other balms.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna start by saying I&#x27;ve been tattooed for many hours, and have tried just about all commercially available tattoo aftercare products, and quite a few lesser known aftercare salves and creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen this product in a few different tattoo shops but always avoided it because it looked how could i say &amp;#34;old fashioned and basic&amp;#34; for a tattoo balm. I purchased it for $4 here on amazon, and for that price it was something I easily tossed in my shopping cart and I&#x27;m glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The balm has a very minimal scent, I know it says Unscented in the description but I&#x27;d say theres a VERY light scent. Not strong or identifiable. I&#x27;d say it smells lightly sweet. I think this is from the Aloe in the salve, but is nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is light, and good for a thin layer on a freshly healing tattoo. Absorbs quickly without feeling &#x27;greasy&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, a great steal for 4 bucks and i&#x27;ll be purchasing another for my next piece!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shopped around for different tattoo treatment creams and I have yet to use one that can beat this stuff. My favorite thing is how long it lasts. If you don&#x27;t over do your covering (you shouldn&#x27;t be) then you can make this tiny can go a long way.</li>
            <li> Used this instead of the previous tattoo balm that broke me out.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff smelled better and did not break me out.</li>
            <li> Great product for my new tat! I got it here for much cheaper than at the shop. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible. My sister and I both used it. Got infections not even a day later. As a professional tattoo artist I advise everyone to use tattoo goo or just use a and d.</li>
            <li> I was told by an aquaintance to get this product on my Tat and it has helped my skin heal pretty well</li>
            <li> I love this product, have used it before.  However when I recieved this package the package was left in my mailbox on 90 degree day causing them to melt. Due to this the product lost the scent I enjoyed so much.  Disappointed</li>
            <li> I love this, but it seems Amazon has a problem keeping it in stock</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> As always this product is terrific skin care for healing tattoos...keeps vibrant colors and skin smooth...I have used this  product for years</li>
            <li> This product helped keep my colors from fading so much.  I just love it. I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Works great for tattoos</li>
            <li> I have tried other products and found, for me, this works best. I put it on long after the tattoo has healed, just to keep it moisturized and looking vibrant.</li>
            <li> this product is simply genius the best product out there for after care&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I RECOMENT THIS PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: none</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I wanted!! Wanted another can cuz I&#x27;m almost running out after getting a tattoo recently, and it&#x27;s the exact size I wanted and every, Awesome!! Def recommend. Just sucks its a add on item:(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for awhile after tattoo has healed to a deagree. Works good.&lt;br /&gt;Lots of natural oils. Soothing, cheap and enough for more then one small to medium tattoo..</li>
            <li> Finding a balm to use for aftercare is very tedious. Lotions have so many ingredients in them, and of course I cant discern all the complicated names, most have fragrance anyway, or have oil in them which is bad for your tattoo. With TatWax, I dont have to worry about all that crazy stuff. A little goes a long way. Travel sized, I take it everywhere I go, more convenient than a huge conspicuous bottle of lotion (especially if i am going to the public bathroom with it in). Could replace your other moisturizers even after the tattoo has healed up. I only use TatWax.</li>
            <li> great stuff my tats are healing ultra fast I love it !!. I will be getting more.and more after that.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  My tattoo heeled nicely and this is easy to carry with me and is all natural oils.  So happy with it.</li>
            <li> helps with the itching on my tattoo a must have!!! I love it and never leave home without it especially with my new tattoo healing</li>
            <li> Soothing.  Lasts longer than lotion.  Helps with itchiness that comes with a fresh tattoo.  I recommend using it for any new tats.</li>
            <li> Excellent product enhanced the colors in my tattoo, helped with the healing process tremendously</li>
            <li> This stuff is the balm!! :p it works great and smells amazing! Healed my tattoo much better than lubriderm or cocoa butter ever has..</li>
            <li> Works like it&#x27;s supposed to.  Haven&#x27;t had any problems with it, can&#x27;t say that about some other more expensive products.</li>
