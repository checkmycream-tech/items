            <li>excellent product</li>
            <li>This one is perfect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best DUPE I&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li>But, the product is good for the price!</li>
            <li>The price is great, too.</li>
            <li>Great product and I will buy this again.</li>
            <li>Ya, the pigment definitely isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very nice on olive skin tones.</li>
            <li>Elf does an amazing job with their blushes!</li>
            <li>Amazing for the summer!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the bright color mis-lead you.</li>
            <li>I know Elf&#x27;s Studio blushes are good, as I&#x27;ve used others, but this one had no pigmentation at all.</li>
            <li>it just looks gorgeous on my cheeks and nothing beats it.</li>
            <li>not everything is good:</li>
            <li>very nice very pretty and very bright ,i like it</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Gives a nice sun kissed kind of look to the cheeks.</li>
            <li>The elf packaging is really nice, it reminds me of the nars packaging</li>
            <li>I own both of those &amp; had 2 c 4 myself.</li>
            <li>Beautiful color looks just like the picture and super fast shipping!!!!</li>
            <li>This blush perfectly mimics the color that is naturally found in my face.</li>
            <li>There are so many options.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice, rosy glow and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>One person commented that it doesn&#x27;t go on well on top of foundation, but I haven&#x27;t had a problem with that at all.</li>
            <li>I love elf blushes.</li>
            <li>,it applys well ,im pleased</li>
            <li>BUT ITS OK FOR THE PRICE</li>
            <li>I love this blush</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>This ELF product is a great price &amp; decent quality.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very pigmented and cheap elf makes some great products</li>
            <li>Easily one of my most used blushes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not gaudy (unless you&#x27;re going way over the top with it) and gives that perfect pink cheek.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect pink for an every day look.</li>
            <li>It applies really easy.</li>
            <li>So Easy cream blush, &amp;</li>
            <li>This colour is sooooo flattering, huge amount of product that&#x27;s creamy and pigmented.</li>
            <li>the color looks fabulous on</li>
            <li>If you loved mac blush like I do but don&#x27;t want to pay the MAC PRICE than this blush in pink passion is similar but milani&#x27;s is more pigmented and closer in color!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I ordered this blush because I had seen on a YouTube video that this color was a very good copy of MAC&#x27;s blush Pink Swoon &amp; So Sweet</li>
            <li>I must say it is true.</li>
            <li>Milani cosmetics new matte blush is delishioso pink:)!!!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it was meant to be vibrant, but I think I got a dud.</li>
            <li>A very pretty blush color</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty look, very fresh looking.</li>
            <li>however a dupe to me means \\&quot;the same as\\&quot; or better!</li>
            <li>The color here is only good on me if I have a decent tan, which I never do anymore.  </li>
            <li>For me, the color is just right and in fact is the first blush I&#x27;ve found that&#x27;s pink enough for my very fair pinkish skin.</li>
            <li>THE BLUSH WAS BEAUTIFUL, BUT DOESN&#x27;T LAST LONG</li>
            <li>This color may look bold, but it&#x27;s very blend-able and build-able.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;THE BLUSH IS SO PRETTY WHEN FIRST APPLIED ON.</li>
            <li>Well, used with a light hand, it actually gives you the nicest glow, giving you a sweet, doll-faced look.</li>
            <li>First off, this blush has a sleek look and reminds me of NARS.</li>
            <li>I would most definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been a fan of powder blush, but haven&#x27;t ever really found the right shade.</li>
            <li>For many people, this blush will be waaaay too pink.</li>
            <li>I love the color pink passion</li>
            <li>The way its designed its so dramatic and great.</li>
            <li>These blushes are a decent dupe for Nars.  </li>
            <li>I read a lot of reviews from makeup blogs while looking for a new blush.</li>
            <li>Seeing that this blush is discontinued on the mac website there is a dupe for this blush now is new</li>
            <li>Great for dark skin and pale skin!</li>
            <li>I use a large brush so it more subtle.</li>
            <li>so far it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>When I apply it, it actually doesn&#x27;t show much.</li>
            <li>It did what the review said it would do, it&#x27;s a fun blush when I need a touch of pink.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way; I apply it with a brush to the apples of my cheeks and then stroke back and forth (cheek to hairline) to get a nice blended look.</li>
            <li>I have super pale skin that I can&#x27;t always find a foundation match for.</li>

            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long-lasting and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Very pink for everyday.</li>

            <li> And, for a person who wears minimal makeup, I hate that \\&quot;pile-on\\&quot; feel.</li>
            <li> Sorry to the makers, but it needs another formula before it will succeed.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not as expensive as nars.</li>
            <li> When you apply them use a stipple brush because it is crazy pigmented and you don&#x27;t want to walk out of the house looking like a clown.</li>
            <li> It looks crazy in the pan</li>

            <li> Perfect for my Halloween makeup! Very pink for everyday.</li>
            <li> It did what the review said it would do, it&#x27;s a fun blush when I need a touch of pink.</li>

            <li> This colour is sooooo flattering, huge amount of product that&#x27;s creamy and pigmented. A must have for anyone not just those on a budget</li>
            <li> These blushes are a decent dupe for Nars.  The color here is only good on me if I have a decent tan, which I never do anymore.  But, the product is good for the price!</li>
            <li> This product does NOT have enough pigment for my taste to make it justifiable. It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;read&amp;#34; well. It takes quite a bit to even be noticeable. I would skip E.L.F. and go with another company&#x27;s blush. Sorry to the makers, but it needs another formula before it will succeed. There are so many options.</li>
            <li> Love it! Great for dark skin and pale skin!</li>
            <li> excellent product this is my second time buying this...always come on time.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice, rosy glow and goes on smoothly. It&#x27;s long-lasting and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Way too pink for my skin tone...Even pinker than it appears.Won&#x27;t buy it again as I also don&#x27;t like its texture.</li>
            <li> the color really makes your cheeks pop and it really hides it if youre feeling tired or youre just pale</li>
            <li> For many people, this blush will be waaaay too pink.

            <li> I love elf blushes. They are all pigmented, creamy, and blendable. I love the color pink passion it just looks gorgeous on my cheeks and nothing beats it. The elf packaging is really nice, it reminds me of the nars packaging but it&#x27;s not as expensive as nars. These blushes last on your cheek for awhile and I usually only reapply or touch up once while I&#x27;m out all day. When you apply them use a stipple brush because it is crazy pigmented and you don&#x27;t want to walk out of the house looking like a clown. There is nothing negative at all about these blushes. Elf does an amazing job with their blushes!</li>
            <li> very nice very pretty and very bright ,i like it the color looks fabulous on ,it applys well ,im pleased</li>

            <li> I love this blush it&#x27;s very pigmented and cheap elf makes some great products but like all brands I&#x27;ve come across ( high-end and low-end) not everything is good:( but this blush is one of the greats for me and some people seem to think this blush is a dupe for mac cosmetics powder blush in pink swoon I would have to disagree they are similar however a dupe to me means \\&quot;the same as\\&quot; or better! Not similar BUT! Seeing that this blush is discontinued on the mac website there is a dupe for this blush now is new and it&#x27;s drugstore BUT! It&#x27;s the best DUPE I&#x27;ve found so far it&#x27;s Milani cosmetics new matte blush is delishioso pink:)!!! If you loved mac blush like I do but don&#x27;t want to pay the MAC PRICE than this blush in pink passion is similar but milani&#x27;s is more pigmented and closer in color!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It looks crazy in the pan and I was honestly a bit afraid because I am super-fair skinned. Well, used with a light hand, it actually gives you the nicest glow, giving you a sweet, doll-faced look. Amazing for the summer! Easily one of my most used blushes.</li>
            <li> First off, this blush has a sleek look and reminds me of NARS. This color may look bold, but it&#x27;s very blend-able and build-able. I love this. I would most definitely buy this again. The way its designed its so dramatic and great. Great product and I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I must say, I am NOT totally \\&quot;wowed\\&quot; by this product. The pigment isn&#x27;t as POW as the image makes it seem. When I apply it, it actually doesn&#x27;t show much. And, for a person who wears minimal makeup, I hate that \\&quot;pile-on\\&quot; feel. Ya, the pigment definitely isn&#x27;t great. I am an AA female, medium complexion.</li>
