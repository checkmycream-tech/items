    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>especially love the veil</li>
            <li>and I have been very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Best part is it does not bother my eyes.</li>
            <li>This product is great!  </li>
            <li>This product was awesome!  </li>
            <li>Best eye cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Over all this is a great product that I would recommend to all my friends.</li>
            <li>so happy though...)  </li>
            <li>This product was great.</li>
            <li>oh so amazingly happy.</li>
            <li>How do you think people ski and stay very warm?</li>
            <li>When I put it under my eyes, doesn&#x27;t look good.</li>
            <li>Even the best brands don&#x27;t match right in all lights</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I always make sure I have a backup waiting in the wings too!  </li>
            <li>Does what it says and I have tried many!</li>
            <li>This is an outstanding product!</li>
            <li>This product works amazingly on both!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The eye cream really helps repair the skin around the eyes and the shear veil blends into the rest of my skin perfectly</li>
            <li>I was so thrilled to find this on Amazon for cheaper than from my Avon Rep.(She&#x27;s not</li>
            <li>My very favorite part of this cream is the primer on the top; it&#x27;s meant for day wear to help diffuse the oilyness of the cream, but when you use it at night it acts like a soothing &#x27;sealer&#x27;.</li>
            <li>But there is something about the primer in the top of the jar; it seems to seal and set the eye cream so that I don&#x27;t get stinging eyes from straying product.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>Mostly from lack of sleep because of a night owl puppy.</li>
            <li>I have received complements from peoples saying I look like I am healthier and more rested.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ok product</li>
            <li>I love the product;would recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li>The top layer covers imperfections and the bottom cream</li>
            <li>I do wish there was more cream, though.</li>
            <li>I love the brightening effect this product has under my eyes.</li>
            <li>and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love that it is not greasy...</li>
            <li>It does a great job of instantly brightening up the eye area giving you the just rested look :)  </li>
            <li>I have seen a reduction in fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I used this product twice per day and within the first 2 weeks, I started seeing results!!  </li>
            <li>I have tried several creams, and this one is very effective.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m of the impression that most anti-aging products don&#x27;t make that much of a difference.</li>
            <li>The balm on top is very smoothing, I use that under my makeup during the day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been loyal to one type of eye cream</li>
            <li>I rarely wear makeup because it bothers my skin and eyes.</li>
            <li>The top portion of the bottle contains a sheer, shimmery paste that works great a covering up dark circles under the eye.  </li>
            <li>Not the typical good Avon product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product consistently for weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed an appreciable difference.</li>
            <li>I love this cream and am totally hooked!</li>
            <li>And  about the  Sheer veil with potent skin brighteners,  it is not even my skin color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so sure I look younger or illuminated</li>
            <li>Thanks, Avon!</li>
            <li>I have been using many many eye creams over the past five years or so</li>
            <li>Had read some positive feedback from it so wanted to try it.</li>
            <li>but it did add more moister to under my eyes and since I am prone to dry skin</li>
            <li>The reason there is &#x27;nothing to do in (insert name of your town here)&#x27; is because you spend your life avoiding finding interesting, healthy things to do, so you are not good at it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it has actually minimized my fine wrinkles yet</li>
            <li>The cream feels nice and is moisturizing, but it does little else.</li>
            <li>- it definitely diffuses light etc.</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant to try this product.</li>
            <li>I really think it&#x27;s both.  </li>
            <li>This one really helps and people remarked on an improvement in my bags.</li>
            <li>The undereye cream works very well for me.  </li>
            <li>really seems to help the dryness around the eye.  </li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li>The moisturizing cream really hydrates, I use that at night and during the day.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like this at all.....</li>
            <li>The thing that will reduce dark circles the most is reducing the amount of time you spend in front of the screen.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend you to purchase from this seller.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This product is the first product I&#x27;ve used which actually seems to really work.</li>
            <li>The fact that I am naturally pale makes them stand out even more.</li>
            <li>I like that there are two different products in this handy little container.  </li>
            <li>I live in AZ</li>
            <li>I have yet to find any product that does not cause irritation to my very sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so surprised it worked this well!</li>
            <li>I was naturally born with, but it has improved the new state</li>
            <li>I have tried so many creams to get rid of or hide my dark circles at the same time as helping w/fine lines/wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>The packaging was highly professional.</li>
            <li>I would defiantly recommend to anyone even if they have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I actually like this Anew product almost as much as the clinical eye cream.  </li>
            <li>But if you want dark circles gone entirely, you gotta take it easy on the screen time.</li>
            <li>I only use it about every other day and it makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>STILL try new high end products as they come out, and I still go back to Anew (and THIS product especially).</li>
            <li>It did remove the dark circles and made my eyes wide open and more refreshed.</li>
            <li>Granted I have only been using the ANEW for a couple of days, but so far it has worked wonders.</li>
            <li>Definitely works better than a few other creams I tried.</li>
            <li>I have had dark circles under my eyes since I hit junior high.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone with dark circles!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not placebo, I can see the dark circles slowly starting to fade, which makes me</li>
            <li> I think that this cream works well, but it won&#x27;t eliminate dark circles entirely if you are a regular computer/tv user.</li>
            <li> It came earlier then expected.</li>
            <li> You get the cream to moisturize the area around your eyes, and the harder stuff that seems to lock the cream in so it doesn&#x27;t evaporate instantly, especially in the winter when it&#x27;s so dry.</li>
            <li> have enough product left for about another month (and it&#x27;s been a little over a month).</li>
            <li> My schedule has gotten very hectic in recent months and has made my already bad-off eyes worse; they were literally sunken in!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dark circles and bags under my eyes for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> If you didn&#x27;t do that, you&#x27;d find some other non-productive way to entertain yourself.</li>
            <li> The dark circles are totally gone now after using this product a little over 2 months!  </li>
            <li> I have hereditary dark baggy eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have dark circles under my eyes ll the time.  </li>
            <li> My dark circles are still there.  </li>
            <li> It did decrease the dark circles under my eyes a bit</li>
            <li> I have hereditary dark circles and keep hoping to find something to lighten them.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t even have to use any other under eye concealer!  </li>
            <li> I suffer with allergies and along with going through a few other things, I ended up with dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Immediately after applying the cream my bags are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have dark circles since I was little.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a little over a month.</li>
            <li> /&gt;WIthin just a few days</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> in fact it dried my eyeskin out.</li>
            <li> Less darkness!  </li>
            <li> Its a very small jar, but u hardly have to use any each time u apply, little gos a long way!</li>
            <li> I have been using Aveeno Eye Cream for the past month or so</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not healthy.</li>
            <li> The issue is that it&#x27;s not a healthy way to entertain yourself.</li>
            <li> Also my skin color is hard to match up to use a cover up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that spending time in front of a tv or video game is a waste of life.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the other product makes my eyes water and burn so I&#x27;m just using it around the lip lines.  </li>
            <li> I use this stuff everyday without fail.  </li>
            <li> A little disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I hate, hate, hate eye cream getting into my eyes because I&#x27;ve used it on my upper lid area, and my eyes water enough that it can cause a problem.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s cold.</li>
            <li> I have used eye creams until I&#x27;m sick of them!!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Ever since I ordered this eye system, I don&#x27;t go a day without it! It does a great job of instantly brightening up the eye area giving you the just rested look :)  I don&#x27;t know if it has actually minimized my fine wrinkles yet but it defiantly gives the appearance of younger glowing skin with the combination of the lotion and eye veil cream. Its a very small jar, but u hardly have to use any each time u apply, little gos a long way! Over all this is a great product that I would recommend to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many creams to get rid of or hide my dark circles at the same time as helping w/fine lines/wrinkles.  This product works amazingly on both!!!&lt;br /&gt;I especially love the veil - it definitely diffuses light etc. and I don&#x27;t even have to use any other under eye concealer!  Buy this!!</li>
            <li> I am a 20-something \\&quot;African-American\\&quot; (in quotes because I&#x27;m using that term for convenience) female. I have hereditary dark baggy eyes.  My schedule has gotten very hectic in recent months and has made my already bad-off eyes worse; they were literally sunken in!&lt;br /&gt;I started using this product. It&#x27;s been a little over a month. My (under)eyes are tighter. I noticed the difference after 8-9 days. Also, the darkness I was starting to experience has lightened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t improve the state of my eyes I was naturally born with, but it has improved the new state my eyes have recently become.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have enough product left for about another month (and it&#x27;s been a little over a month). I use twice a day as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I have used eye creams until I&#x27;m sick of them!! This one I will keep using until they stop making it, and then I&#x27;ll curl up into the fetal position in the corner and cry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried Mary Kay, Lancome (65 freeking dollars), Estee Lauder, Shiseido, Clinique, Pro-X by Olay, various Avon eye creams, ..and brands I&#x27;ve no doubt forgotten by now. If it is sold at Dillards then I&#x27;ve tried it, and been disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WIthin just a few days you will notice a difference with this cream. My very favorite part of this cream is the primer on the top; it&#x27;s meant for day wear to help diffuse the oilyness of the cream, but when you use it at night it acts like a soothing &#x27;sealer&#x27;. I hate, hate, hate eye cream getting into my eyes because I&#x27;ve used it on my upper lid area, and my eyes water enough that it can cause a problem. But there is something about the primer in the top of the jar; it seems to seal and set the eye cream so that I don&#x27;t get stinging eyes from straying product.&lt;br /&gt;In the day, I like that I&#x27;m not getting greasy leftovers from eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I STILL try new high end products as they come out, and I still go back to Anew (and THIS product especially). Maybe I like the satisfaction of proving to myself that just because it costs 3-5 times as much, it&#x27;s not better. If you only try one eye product, try this one! No matter what your age, try it!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend you to purchase from this seller. The packaging was highly professional. It came earlier then expected. I will buy from this person again.</li>
            <li> I have had dark circles under my eyes since I hit junior high. The fact that I am naturally pale makes them stand out even more. I have tried every reasonably-priced product out there to no avail. Granted I have only been using the ANEW for a couple of days, but so far it has worked wonders. Immediately after applying the cream my bags are less noticeable. The \\&quot;veil\\&quot; is an added bonus to go on underneath my regular makeup. I&#x27;m hoping that I can stop using under-eye concealer altogether after using this product for a while. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to try this product. I have had dark circles around my eyes for as long as I can remember, but lately they have gotten more pronounced. Mostly from lack of sleep because of a night owl puppy. I rarely wear makeup because it bothers my skin and eyes. Also my skin color is hard to match up to use a cover up. Even the best brands don&#x27;t match right in all lights so I thought I would give this a try. I have been using it for a few weeks now and I have been very happy with it. The eye cream really helps repair the skin around the eyes and the shear veil blends into the rest of my skin perfectly so I can&#x27;t even tell I have anything on. Best part is it does not bother my eyes. I only use it about every other day and it makes a huge difference. I have received complements from peoples saying I look like I am healthier and more rested. I can feel that the skin around my eyes is getting tighter and the few wrinkles I had around my eyes from not wearing my glasses as much as I should are disappearing. I would defiantly recommend to anyone even if they have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using Aveeno Eye Cream for the past month or so and I saw changes but then I ordered this from a coworker and used BOTH and I SWEAR it works.  I&#x27;ve been raving about it to my girlfriends!  She asked if it was the Aveeno working or both.  I really think it&#x27;s both.  I&#x27;m going to leave a review for Aveena also.  I use it for bags under eyes in the morning.  My eyes are no longer \\&quot;puffy\\&quot; underneath.  I use morning and evening.  I&#x27;m so surprised it worked this well!</li>
            <li> I have seen a reduction in fine lines around my eyes.  The top portion of the bottle contains a sheer, shimmery paste that works great a covering up dark circles under the eye.  This product is great!  I love it!</li>
            <li> A little disappointed in this product. Had read some positive feedback from it so wanted to try it. The cream feels nice and is moisturizing, but it does little else. No help with the bags.. and can&#x27;t tell any lifting effect going on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product consistently for weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed an appreciable difference. It&#x27;s an ok product but it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li> I love the product;would recommend it to my friends. It did remove the dark circles and made my eyes wide open and more refreshed.</li>
            <li> I have dark circles under my eyes ll the time.  They never go away!  This eye cream is the bomb I tell you!  I noticed a difference after about 2 weeks. Less darkness!  I use this stuff everyday without fail.  I always make sure I have a backup waiting in the wings too!  I highly recommend this product to anyone with dark circles!!  I was so thrilled to find this on Amazon for cheaper than from my Avon Rep.(She&#x27;s not so happy though...)  This stuff has done wonders for me..as my circles lightened my self-esteem went up.  I love this cream and am totally hooked!</li>
            <li> Does what it says and I have tried many! This one really helps and people remarked on an improvement in my bags.</li>
            <li> I like that there are two different products in this handy little container.  The undereye cream works very well for me.  Unfortunately the other product makes my eyes water and burn so I&#x27;m just using it around the lip lines.  I have yet to find any product that does not cause irritation to my very sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t help your eyes at all</li>
            <li> I actually like this Anew product almost as much as the clinical eye cream.  The top layer covers imperfections and the bottom cream really seems to help the dryness around the eye.  I live in AZ so your skin tends to be drier.</li>
            <li> This product was awesome!  I suffer with allergies and along with going through a few other things, I ended up with dark circles under my eyes.  I used this product twice per day and within the first 2 weeks, I started seeing results!!  The dark circles are totally gone now after using this product a little over 2 months!  Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> I have dark circles since I was little. I have been using  this cream for  four  months already, but  I don&#x27;t  see any improvement.  My dark circles are still there.  And  about the  Sheer veil with potent skin brighteners,  it is not even my skin color. When I put it under my eyes, doesn&#x27;t look good. It looks shiny and  is brighter than my skin color. I can see even from a distance that I have put something under my eyes. I will not  buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m of the impression that most anti-aging products don&#x27;t make that much of a difference. I always try though because you never know! This one, I like. The moisturizing cream really hydrates, I use that at night and during the day. The balm on top is very smoothing, I use that under my makeup during the day. I&#x27;m not so sure I look younger or illuminated but I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This product was great. I wouldn&#x27;t call it a miracle worker but it did add more moister to under my eyes and since I am prone to dry skin this kept my skin moist throughout the day. It did decrease the dark circles under my eyes a bit and I would definitely purchase this again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dark circles and bags under my eyes for as long as I can remember. This product is the first product I&#x27;ve used which actually seems to really work. It&#x27;s definitely not placebo, I can see the dark circles slowly starting to fade, which makes me oh so amazingly happy. Already planning on ordering another bottle immediately. Thanks, Avon!</li>
            <li> I have hereditary dark circles and keep hoping to find something to lighten them.  I&#x27;ve used this for about a month and there has been no change at all.  Also there was a big air pocket in the container, so I only got about 1/2 the product I should&#x27;ve.</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding product! I do wish there was more cream, though. I love the brightening effect this product has under my eyes.</li>
            <li> This tightened my under eye area. However, when used as directed, it did nothing for under eye circles. They weren&#x27;t even lightened. If I needed something for eye bags or wrinkles, I would buy this product, but it didn&#x27;t work for what I needed it for. A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this at all.....in fact it dried my eyeskin out.Not the typical good Avon product.What a dissapointment.</li>
            <li> I have been using many many eye creams over the past five years or so and this is my favorite. I bought it based on the reviews. I love that it is not greasy... it soaks into the skin immediately and just leaves a softer appearance. I wear it under my makeup and before I go to bed. I&#x27;ve never been loyal to one type of eye cream but this one is a keeper. I&#x27;ll be getting it again.</li>
            <li> I think that this cream works well, but it won&#x27;t eliminate dark circles entirely if you are a regular computer/tv user. The thing that will reduce dark circles the most is reducing the amount of time you spend in front of the screen. I have tried several creams, and this one is very effective. It did definitely reduce the circles. You get the cream to moisturize the area around your eyes, and the harder stuff that seems to lock the cream in so it doesn&#x27;t evaporate instantly, especially in the winter when it&#x27;s so dry. Definitely works better than a few other creams I tried. Applying twice a day is enough. But if you want dark circles gone entirely, you gotta take it easy on the screen time. Our eyes, after millions of years of evolution, were not meant for what we do to them. It&#x27;s not healthy. You need to go outside. Yes, it&#x27;s cold. That&#x27;s why baby jesus invented clothes. How do you think people ski and stay very warm? Go outside, take a walk on a nature trail. Stop watching tv and playing video games. The reason there is &#x27;nothing to do in (insert name of your town here)&#x27; is because you spend your life avoiding finding interesting, healthy things to do, so you are not good at it. It&#x27;s not that spending time in front of a tv or video game is a waste of life. If you didn&#x27;t do that, you&#x27;d find some other non-productive way to entertain yourself. The issue is that it&#x27;s not a healthy way to entertain yourself. PSA OVER! Also batman.</li>
            <li> Best eye cream I have ever used. I hope Avon never stops making it!</li>
