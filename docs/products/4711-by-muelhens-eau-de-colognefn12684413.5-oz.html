            <li>It is a very light for ocassions just want to feel  refreshed.</li>
            <li>This is probably my favorite scent of all time.</li>
            <li>Is it also my favorite product?</li>
            <li>but the label could be done better.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve used 4711 for decades, so I am very familiar with its scent.</li>
            <li>This is a very old, great smelling cologne.</li>
            <li>Still a great scent, fresh, clean and not too sweet.</li>
            <li>It is very light and dissipates quickly but reemerges when you sweat and your skin warms.</li>
            <li>Man or woman, it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li>This is classic good, I have always loved this stuff, it&#x27;s fresh and citrisey not overpowering at all, highly recommend for anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to smell like a jerk.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t enjoy it every day, but I will continue to enjoy it on occasion.</li>
            <li>Very fresh and summery.</li>
            <li>It smells clean and works for both men and women, not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>like the clean citrus like smell.</li>
            <li>But with all that said, I still love this scent so much</li>
            <li>I love this stuff even though I did not find it very practical.</li>
            <li>Bought some last year but a friend just loved it so.................</li>
            <li>Fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>This is the world&#x27;s first and original Cologne.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t Gotten Lucky With Any Top Models, Actresses or Other Famous People...</li>
            <li>This is a huge bottle and such a lovely fragrance.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still worth it.  </li>
            <li>once a day, twice a day on rare occasion).</li>
            <li>Fresh, crisp, citrus-y fragrance.</li>
            <li>If someone made a version of this that had the strength and projection of a good quality spray on cologne, it would be hands down the first scent I reach for.</li>
            <li>The smell is so wonderful there are a lot of people (especially in hot climates) who deal with this by carrying around a small atomizer or packs of wipes or both and reapply it a few times per day.</li>
            <li>scent is very distinct and more &#x27;derived from nature&#x27; than other fragrances.</li>
            <li>Never Outdated!</li>
            <li>Exactly what we wanted</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely don&#x27;t buy this until you&#x27;ve smelled it first-</li>
            <li>While never overpowering, one was pleasantly aware of 4711&#x27;s fragrance for 8-10 hours after applying it.</li>
            <li>It is my favorite scent of all time - light, fresh, citrusy, with a very slight hint of floral.  </li>
            <li>4711 absolutely, positively is a neutral scent.</li>
            <li>I seriously (but briefly) considered doing this myself, but the truth is, even though I found splashing this stuff on to be a pleasant ritual, I&#x27;m just not going to reapply cologne any more often than I&#x27;m going to shower (</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t project strongly and doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>My mother, who is over 100, has been using it her whole life and wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li>; I like it just as much now as I did then.  </li>
            <li>Very &amp;#34;antique&amp;#34; looking.</li>
            <li>4711 is one of the very oldest colognes in the world.</li>
            <li>Used it for years and never tired of it.</li>
            <li>Order for my mother who has used this German brand for 50 years and always smells terrific :)</li>
            <li>Classic Cologne...</li>
            <li>More of a citrus scent vs. a heavy musk scent.  </li>
            <li>Great for casual daytime use.</li>
            <li>Very old school.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, this new version of 4711 masquerading itself as the original product is a disgraceful sham and should be removed from Amazon&#x27;s product listing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also completely unisex.  </li>
            <li>Not too heavy, not too light.</li>
            <li>An old scent.</li>
            <li>WOW.  </li>
            <li>Looks like something you&#x27;d find in a truck stop convenience store, which is kind of unfortunate as this is a very classy</li>
            <li>Different merchant from last order, but service is fast and reliable.</li>
            <li>The gentle, floral scent has only the slightest trace of its former strength.</li>
            <li>Amazing how expensive this has gotten.</li>
            <li>Crisp, slight lemon, spice splash on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty disappointed, but I&#x27;ll find some kind of sprayer for it, or figure out another way.</li>
            <li>The fleeting smell of denatured alcohol is predominant - and less than a minute later, nothing much of anything at all.</li>

            <li> this is a light citrus scent that I really like and have been unable to find anywhere else- try it!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last tremendously long, but</li>
            <li> Does not last a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not like I care about this one way or the other- my only concern was the liquid inside-</li>
            <li> If you do, it&#x27;s literally ten times cheaper to buy this size bottle than the little pcket-size bottles in any duty-free store.</li>
            <li> Not much else</li>
            <li> My purchase of this crappy product has proven to be wholly unsatisfactory, a waste of good money, and unnecessarily annoying.</li>
            <li> Love this Cologne, but Very Disappointing to have received to splash bottle instead of a spray bottle.</li>
            <li> Also, even at just $2 per ounce, this stuff goes so fast that it get surprisingly expensive.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s presented as a 13.5 oz.</li>
            <li> Maybe my mind is playing tricks on me, but the label I recall from years ago was a heavy paper stock with matte finish and the gold \\&quot;medallions\\&quot; were embossed.</li>
            <li> But now, with my recent purchase, I find something with this product has gone quite wrong.</li>
            <li> but, this is hardly a complaint.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t noticed anything negative about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Subtle not overbearing.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am John&#x27;s wife and have been using 4711 for 30 years.  It is my favorite scent of all time - light, fresh, citrusy, with a very slight hint of floral.  Reminds me of a \\&quot;just out of the shower\\&quot; scent.  Doesn&#x27;t last tremendously long, but ..... it&#x27;s still worth it.  I&#x27;ve gotten the soap too, hoping that along with the cologne would cling longer.  The jury&#x27;s still out.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we wanted</li>
            <li> 4711 isn&#x27;t just a perfume/aftershave, it&#x27;s also the address in Cologne Germany where it is made.  I like the bergamot and citrus scent and even animals seem to like it.  My wife likes it.  It&#x27;s good that she is hooked on Emeraude or she would steal my after shave. It&#x27;s now being marketed to women, which doesn&#x27;t make me feel muy macho, nor does that threaten my masculinity.</li>
            <li> Different merchant from last order, but service is fast and reliable. Great price, great product. Order for my mother who has used this German brand for 50 years and always smells terrific :)</li>
            <li> I bought this because I&#x27;m a fan of their aftershave. The scent is identical. In both cases, that&#x27;s Lemon, Bergamot, Neroli, Lavender, and Rosemary. This is probably my favorite scent of all time. Is it also my favorite product? No. If someone made a version of this that had the strength and projection of a good quality spray on cologne, it would be hands down the first scent I reach for. As it is, this has become relegated to a sleeping or lounging around the house fragrance for me. Why? It doesn&#x27;t project strongly and doesn&#x27;t last. The smell is so wonderful there are a lot of people (especially in hot climates) who deal with this by carrying around a small atomizer or packs of wipes or both and reapply it a few times per day. I seriously (but briefly) considered doing this myself, but the truth is, even though I found splashing this stuff on to be a pleasant ritual, I&#x27;m just not going to reapply cologne any more often than I&#x27;m going to shower (once a day, twice a day on rare occasion). Also, even at just $2 per ounce, this stuff goes so fast that it get surprisingly expensive. But with all that said, I still love this scent so much I don&#x27;t ever see myself being without a bottle again. I can&#x27;t enjoy it every day, but I will continue to enjoy it on occasion. That&#x27;s why it got 5 stars: because I&#x27;m hopelessly biased. I love this stuff even though I did not find it very practical. I guess that&#x27;s this relic from the 18th century is still around.ive and a lot of work.</li>
            <li> this is a light citrus scent that I really like and have been unable to find anywhere else- try it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and love it! It smells clean and works for both men and women, not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> This is a very old, great smelling cologne. Very fresh and summery. Makes a great combination with the aftershave. Just wished it lasted a big longer but, this is hardly a complaint.</li>
            <li> Purchased some years ago, been looking for it ever since. Thrilled to locate it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very distinct and more &#x27;derived from nature&#x27; than other fragrances. You could probably call it \\&quot;earthy\\&quot;. They seem to have changed the formula to increase the duration- to make it last longer- but I haven&#x27;t noticed anything negative about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not like I care about this one way or the other- my only concern was the liquid inside- but the label could be done better. Maybe my mind is playing tricks on me, but the label I recall from years ago was a heavy paper stock with matte finish and the gold \\&quot;medallions\\&quot; were embossed. This label is cheaper, tackier. Looks like something you&#x27;d find in a truck stop convenience store, which is kind of unfortunate as this is a very classy product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It truly is gender neutral. A lot of colognes/scents are advertised as unisex, but almost always they trend towards one side or another... a bit too flowery and feminine, or a bit too leathery and manly. 4711 absolutely, positively is a neutral scent. Man or woman, it&#x27;s fine (I&#x27;m a man, I wear it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely don&#x27;t buy this until you&#x27;ve smelled it first- the scent isn&#x27;t for everyone- but if you already know what this is and like it, then nothing else will do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love 4711.</li>
            <li> Fresh and clean. My mother, who is over 100, has been using it her whole life and wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> I used to wear this fragrance all the time, but it disappeared from local shelves, so I had forgotten about it.  I chanced upon it on Amazon and ordered it; I like it just as much now as I did then.  My only complaint is that it&#x27;s presented as a 13.5 oz. cologne SPRAY, and it&#x27;s actually the splash-on bottle.  (I probably should have known from the picture, but I was trusting the description.)  I&#x27;m pretty disappointed, but I&#x27;ll find some kind of sprayer for it, or figure out another way.</li>
            <li> This is classic good, I have always loved this stuff, it&#x27;s fresh and citrisey not overpowering at all, highly recommend for anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to smell like a jerk.</li>
            <li> This cologne is lovely crisp, floral scent that is perfect for splashing on for a hot day. It is very light and dissipates quickly but reemerges when you sweat and your skin warms. It is perfect right after a shower. Great for casual daytime use. It&#x27;s also completely unisex.  I also like the glass bottle presentation. Very &amp;#34;antique&amp;#34; looking.</li>
            <li> Fresh, crisp, citrus-y fragrance. Not too heavy, not too light. I use it as an after shave or as a pick-me-up before going out with my wife to a restaurant or party. I consider this a summer fragrance. I have been using it for many years. 4711 is one of the very oldest colognes in the world. It is, in fact, made in Cologne, Germany.</li>
            <li> This is the world&#x27;s first and original Cologne.&lt;br /&gt;I like the clean citrus like smell.</li>
            <li> You either like this old-fashioned fragrance or you don&#x27;t.  If you do, it&#x27;s literally ten times cheaper to buy this size bottle than the little pcket-size bottles in any duty-free store.</li>
            <li> wonderful cologne!!!!love it!!!!fresh smell!!!</li>
            <li> Like the fragrance of this cologne  I use it at all the time. It is a very light for ocassions just want to feel  refreshed.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance. Crisp, slight lemon, spice splash on. Just love it. Great price too! Bought some last year but a friend just loved it so.................bye bye</li>
            <li> An old scent. Not much else I can say that hasn&#x27;t been said. Does not last a long time. More of a citrus scent vs. a heavy musk scent.  Very old school. Amazing how expensive this has gotten. I think it has become more popular.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 4711 for decades, so I am very familiar with its scent. While never overpowering, one was pleasantly aware of 4711&#x27;s fragrance for 8-10 hours after applying it. But now, with my recent purchase, I find something with this product has gone quite wrong. The gentle, floral scent has only the slightest trace of its former strength. The fleeting smell of denatured alcohol is predominant - and less than a minute later, nothing much of anything at all. In my opinion, this new version of 4711 masquerading itself as the original product is a disgraceful sham and should be removed from Amazon&#x27;s product listing. My purchase of this crappy product has proven to be wholly unsatisfactory, a waste of good money, and unnecessarily annoying. I wish a \\&quot;zero\\&quot; star rating for this shameful revision were possible.</li>
            <li> One of the oldest men&#x27;s Colognes ever made (In Cologne after all).  Bright and clean, citrus spice fragrance at a good price.</li>
            <li> WOW.  I need to pay attention to ounces!  This is a huge bottle and such a lovely fragrance.  Reminds me of Florence.  I splash it everywhere.</li>
            <li> Used it for years and never tired of it. Subtle not overbearing.</li>
            <li> Smells great. My , mom and friend loves it. Bought 3 already.</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on the application description that it was a spray. It comes in a regular splash bottle. Love this Cologne, but Very Disappointing to have received to splash bottle instead of a spray bottle.</li>
            <li> Classic Cologne... Never Outdated! I haven&#x27;t Gotten Lucky With Any Top Models, Actresses or Other Famous People... I&#x27;ve Certainly Scored With Attracting The Beautiful Peasants Who Are Looking For A Good Time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 4711 for years. Still a great scent, fresh, clean and not too sweet. Love the bottle, too.</li>
