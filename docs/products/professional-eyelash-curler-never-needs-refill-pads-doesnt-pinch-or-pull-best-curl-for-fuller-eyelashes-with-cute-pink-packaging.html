            <li>Good packaging and quality.</li>
            <li>I used to have a Japonesque eyelash curler that I LOVED...</li>

            <li>I was planning on purchasing another eyelash curler but decided on this one since it seemed to get good reviews.</li>
            <li>I would also do it after putting on my eye make up just to make them look good.</li>
            <li>given because it did provide a good curl and its construction appears sturdy.</li>
            <li>Seems like a good curler, time will tell.</li>
            <li>in all, it seems like a good eyelash curler....</li>

            <li>I was in the market for a good quality eyelash curler</li>
            <li>I loved the results and got compliments often.</li>
            <li>Probably not, however it is a good value for this price</li>
            <li>It does a good job curling my lashes.</li>
            <li>(hey, it works!), so this one looked like a good replacement because it states that refills are never needed.  </li>
            <li>design of this curler is perfect to fit all eye shapes and sizes.</li>
            <li>My opinions and dazzling lashes are my own.</li>

            <li>but in order to give my honest opinion I did for 3 days</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t like the kind I had in the 80</li>
            <li>I did receive this as a sample to review and give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>I would test it out and give you my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice because it doesn&#x27;t pinch or pull on my lashes while I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li>It has a really nice silicone pad that keeps it&#x27;s shape and my lashes don&#x27;t get stuck on it, so it&#x27;s painless.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems to work ok.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I can&#x27;t get my lashes to curl nicely with it.</li>

            <li>The pad didn&#x27;t stick to my eyelashes and it did give me a nice curl.</li>
            <li>Opinions are 100% my own</li>
            <li>Got the product promptly, even received 2 emails from the seller offering any support I might need, which was nice.</li>
            <li>I ordered another one because I really liked it at the beginning, so I&#x27;m hoping that it&#x27;ll work out this time around...</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t pinch my lashes, yet it curls them nicely.</li>

            <li>/&gt;It fits nice on your fingers and once the ladies got the hang of the motion required, there was no pinching or pulling of the eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Another trick I have heard was to warm the curler with a hair dryer to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; the curl, I haven&#x27;t tried it</li>
            <li>Opinions are 100% my own.</li>

            <li>and they were ok</li>
            <li>The packaging was adorable, though it was a bit squished when it arrived.</li>

            <li>I was able to get this eyelash curler for free to review as part of a promotion.</li>
            <li>most importantly, it DOESN&#x27;T pinch you nor does it pull your eyelashes off.  </li>
            <li>You know instantly the first time you use it, it feels different, it curls perfectly, it&#x27;s made well &amp; best of all....</li>
            <li>and my lashes got a great natural looking curl from them.</li>
            <li>most reviews were written in exchange for a free curler.  </li>
            <li>Do not hesitate to try this curler - truly fabulous and I am so glad I took the time to research and settle on this one...  </li>
            <li>but I use it almost every day and so far I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
            <li>There are grips on the spots you put your figures in making it so much more comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>The curl is really good, almost too much of a curl.</li>
            <li>received this complimentary product for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>I really loved this eyelash curler, but it didn&#x27;t really stand the test of time.</li>
            <li>A representative from the company emailed me soon after it was delivered and told some good tips for how to use and maintain it, which was very helpful.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s easy to use with soft bumpers that create great curl.  </li>
            <li>was an easy product to work with.</li>
            <li>I had no problems with how my fingers easily slid into the handle.</li>
            <li>Having said that, these didn&#x27;t pinch, and it&#x27;s easy to see the eyelashes appear through the curler</li>

            <li>I also like that it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t pinch or pull out eyelashes, keeps them curled all day...</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to use, even with arthritis in my hands.</li>
            <li>easy to grip too.</li>
            <li>It is extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li>The handles are textured for a non-slip grip which makes primping really easy.</li>
            <li>The grips have a bit of a &amp;#34;rubber&amp;#34; smell to them, though not overly strong.</li>
            <li>One 7 second pump is all it takes for lashes that stay beautifully curled all day.  </li>
            <li>It actually curls perfectly the first go around.  </li>
            <li>That helps to make the process easy and pain free.</li>
            <li>These didn&#x27;t pinch at all, but curled my eyelashes just fine.</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly, and the company followed up with an email to check they arrived OK.</li>
            <li>So far very happy with my new curler, it doesn&#x27;t pinch or crease my lashes.</li>
            <li>The little pad is cushy and hasn&#x27;t flatten out like most pads.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s huge for me.  </li>
            <li>ever since I started curling my lashes again, I have noticed a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LiveWIRE</li>
            <li>This is comfortable to use</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this lash curler about 2 weeks and so far, so good.</li>
            <li>I used a little warm water and soap to clean it and it held up great.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and doesn&#x27;t punch at All!!</li>
            <li>The handles are very comfortable and it&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
            <li>This curler is very nice except it&#x27;s not curved enough for my eyes</li>
            <li>Also, it is very rare that one, or both, of my eyelids do NOT get pinched.</li>
            <li>The handles fit nicely into the fingers for steady control for curling your eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this one is comfortable and quick and easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use alcohol to keep them clean and germ free.</li>
            <li>It is super easy to use.</li>
            <li>have been using this new one for about a week now and am quite pleased with the results!</li>
            <li>highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to add to my review by posting some pictures and adding I also liked the finger holes having a rubber like lining it makes it softer on the fingers to use.</li>
            <li>so was excited about this product.  </li>
            <li>Which is why I was excited to get a chance to review it.</li>
            <li>I also felt pretty safe using it, because I was worried it would damage my lashes or pull them out, but I don’t think it’s going to happen with this product.</li>
            <li>Totally worth every penny!</li>
            <li>so this curler is an easy way to make my eyelashes look pretty!</li>
            <li>I will clean it like I always do anyway, but I don&#x27;t have to worry about the pads coming out.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t curl any better than my regular curler, but it&#x27;s nice to never have to buy a refill.</li>
            <li>they are very lightweight and the handles also work very well allowing good grip.</li>
            <li>It comes in really cute pink packaging which the girls loved.</li>
            <li>Professional Eyelash Culer by LiveWire Beauty is my FAVORITE!</li>
            <li>Loving it so far!</li>
            <li>I only have 4 others to compare it too and can honestly say is a pretty nice curler.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, good results, do not anticipate any problems with it long term.</li>
            <li>What makes this eye lash curler so special?</li>
            <li>, right?!  </li>
            <li>If eye shadow got on the curler, it was super easy to wipe right off.</li>
            <li>The next day I tried about 3 times and I was about to get one eye to look good.</li>
            <li>I received the Professional Eyelash Curler from liveWIRE beauty to try and give my honest opinion</li>
            <li>It works good for my short eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I hope it&#x27;s true that I will never need refills.</li>
            <li>The split was actually full of pulled eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the same Revlon curler for probably 20 years and have loved it.  </li>
            <li>and I regularly clean them with a q-tip and some eye makeup remover, then a quick rinse and a thorough drying</li>
            <li>Overall, good product.</li>
            <li>Overall this curler does a good job, but don&#x27;t buy into the hype that it never pinches ..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Every time I get ready to go either to work or to go out on a date, I always make sure that I look put together</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, but it does pinch.</li>
            <li>you didn’t grow up learning how to use one of these, let me explain quickly that most folks have fairly straight lashes.</li>
            <li>Pretty cool!</li>
            <li>And, we know as we get older, these are very important for our eyes to &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; and keep youthful in appearance.</li>
            <li>As promised, my eyelids didn&#x27;t get pinched and the process was pretty easy.</li>
            <li>, however I am not finding it to be as great as the other reviewers.  </li>
            <li>best of all it lasted my whole 10 hour shift with just a little mascara.</li>
            <li>I love my new eyelash curler from livewire!</li>
            <li>Love this new find!</li>
            <li>curls quickly and evenly.</li>
            <li>I found a $3.00 one at Target that actually works much better, is a better eye shape...</li>
            <li>This curler worked great on my short , straight lashes.  </li>
            <li>T!hankyou for a quick delivery</li>
            <li>These helped me to create more of an open eye look that I love.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes have been falling out since being pregnant with my babies.</li>
            <li>super super superrrr</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t pull, curls well, and if the claim that the rubber never needs replaced is true, well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a really good eyelash curler for a long time.</li>
            <li>I had a good one for a long time but it broke...</li>
            <li>It gives a nice curl without too much effort, you don&#x27;t have to sit there holding it for what seems like forever to get a decent curl.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s double the price of a decent curler (my Tweezerman one was about $7-8) which is a great deal considering you&#x27;ll never have to get refills.</li>
            <li>are my new favorite.</li>
            <li>And if I could the refills they would be more expesive than a new curler.  </li>
            <li>I love my new liveWIRE eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>it has become my new favorite</li>
            <li>My favorite eyelash curler by far!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>I grew up using one, but my daughters didn’t even know what it was at first!</li>
            <li>I hope my personal experiences help you get the most out of yours!</li>
            <li>eyelash curler is an awesome product that comes in this cute black, purple, and pink packaging.</li>
            <li>I was excited about all the positive reviews here...</li>
            <li>I did NOT get this for free, but if LIVEWire Beauty wants to send me any products to try....</li>
            <li>I really like the rubber grips on the handles because it makes this curler comfortable to grip.</li>
            <li>These are good light weight but not cheap.</li>
            <li>It really felt comfortably holding between my fingers.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that I won&#x27;t have to replace the pad.&lt;br /&gt;The service was fast and accurate.</li>
            <li>I was offered this curler complimentary in exchange</li>
            <li>maybe a road tar mixed with plastic kind of smell?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of gross and chemically, but not a deal</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>I was not blessed with long gorgeous lashes, but with this handy curler I had noticeable longer eyelashes on the first try using just regular mascara.</li>
            <li>Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>The curling action of this product is just okay.</li>
            <li>I received this complimentary product from the seller in order to review it for their company.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>but I do use a fair amount of makeup every day and curling my eyelashes was one of my least favorite parts.  </li>
            <li>So I honestly didn&#x27;t think that this would be any different, but I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Bought it based on reviews expecting to be worth the money spend ..</li>
            <li>Effective, but I&#x27;m Asian w/short lashes</li>
            <li>It has a nice, wide curling surface that allows me to rest it against my cheek comfortably to do the deed.</li>
            <li>So glad I purchased this to replace my old one that I have had forever.</li>
            <li>After several uses, I can honestly say that it helped give my lashes a fuller, curvier curl.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>And for $15.00, it&#x27;s got to be worth it</li>
            <li>This curler has worked better than all others I have tried, but it is still not what I would consider a genuine curl, more of a very slight flare.</li>
            <li>I read the description and was most attracted to the &amp;#34;never needs refill pads&amp;#34; which was exactly the reason I was shopping for a new curler.  </li>
            <li>What little mascara comes off on the curler wipes off easily after a quick rinse under warm water.</li>
            <li>I was able to get my lashes curled better than my other curler and they looked longer.</li>
            <li>The company followup is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;For a small company, the customer service is as good as Zappos or Apple, perhaps even better.  </li>
            <li>: I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased review.lashes first to give them that extra boost and definition and then apply some mascara afterwards to give them a bit more volume and darkening them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>I did it for about 10 times one day and couldn&#x27;t get them right.</li>
            <li>This curler let&#x27;s me get right up to the root of my lash without pinching.</li>
            <li>but if u position it the right way you won&#x27;t get pinched.</li>
            <li>They are right when they say it does not pinch.</li>
            <li>It curls just the right amount.</li>
            <li>This curler I simply place my lashes in, squeeze the handle down, and all of my lashes are perfectly in place.</li>
            <li>I may have over curled them the first time so just be aware of that!</li>
            <li>My first experience with using this curler is very positive and the price was right.  </li>
            <li>much recommend, and I appreciate receiving this in exchange for my true and unbiased opinion</li>
            <li>the new pad kept coming out, wouldn&#x27;t fit quite right, etc.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;grippies&amp;#34; on the handles are soft and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>As you can see in the picture, the handles of the LiveWire curler (left) form almost a 90 degree angle, but the front handle of the Revlon curler (right) is bent to create more like a 60 degree angle.</li>
            <li>I love this eyelash curler - the pad springs right back after use and it seems that it holds up well.  </li>
            <li>The true proof of a product is how long it will last, so if this pad really lasts for life, it will be a great product.</li>
            <li>But so far it works fine.</li>
            <li>Feels good to support a little company</li>
            <li>fast delivery too!</li>
            <li>The price is somewhat on the higher side but If need be I would buy the product again again.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I really recommend these!</li>
            <li>First it does pinch eyelids.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t do a better job of curling eyelids than the crappy $3 curlers you can buy at Wal*mart or similar.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have to move it several times to make sure I could angle in all the lashes.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>For, who wants to continually be replacing pads and keeping up with the replacements?!</li>
            <li>I use my professional eyelash curler everyday and I have gotten so many compliments on how nice my lashes look.</li>
            <li>It does the thing where the outer lashes curl more than the middle ones.&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first I thought, &amp;#34;Are</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to do.  </li>
            <li>It did pinch me more than my regular eyelash curlers</li>
            <li>These work very well!</li>
            <li>It does not pinch my eyes (almond-shaped), although I&#x27;m sure it could if I just wasn&#x27;t lined up properly.</li>
            <li>I have tried many curlers over the years, and this is the first one I&#x27;ve found that actually WORKS!!!  </li>
            <li>Thanks!  </li>
            <li>Pinched my eyelids and it really hurts!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I received a response from the rep and they offered to refund my entire purchase on top of sending replacement pads.</li>
            <li>First time I used it, I took a &#x27;before&#x27; picture (included).  </li>
            <li>The first one I ordered I paid almost $20</li>
            <li>It seems that the first curler I received had been defective, and wasn&#x27;t closing correctly.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>First one ever</li>
            <li>using is the same I’d get in a salon, I figure I’m better off getting the job done.</li>
            <li>By using an eyelash curler, you can curl them so your eyes look more “open” and alert.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It curls on the first time.</li>
            <li>It never gets sticky my other one did either which I love!</li>
            <li>and it never pulls my lashes, which is why I stopped curling them in the first place.  </li>
            <li>Now, I curl my lashes first to give them that extra boost and definition and then apply some mascara afterwards to give them a bit more volume and darkening them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have so much stuff in my make up back and purse all the time a lot of my beauty items easily get destroyed, not these babies!</li>
            <li>It is everything other people have already commented on and more... simple to use, effective, and</li>
            <li>This curler has a very professional look to it and it fit very well in my hands.  </li>
            <li>Also, seller gives other beauty tips which was nice.</li>
            <li>LiveWIRE needs to bring the price down for sure &amp; full disclosure</li>
            <li>Wow right!</li>
            <li>Many brands claim to come with LIFETIME warranties or replacements and you find out quickly why, they are not worth it and need to keep replacing.</li>
            <li>At my age, I have tried, bought and used many with most being a complete waste of money and hurting my eyes in the process.</li>
            <li>I have very small thin eyelashes, with this and the perfect mascara, I have big beautiful plump eyelashes</li>
            <li>I actually really love this eyelash curler because it makes my eyelashes look really long.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and works very well!</li>
            <li>I love the silicon pad - so much better than other brands that cut and fall apart after a short period of time.  </li>
            <li>This curler is easy to operate and doesn&#x27;t require any replacement pads, so that’s a big plus.</li>
            <li>Others I have used certainly do.</li>
            <li>This one did seem to grip my eyelashes a bit better than my current one and that may be the silicone (or it could be mine needs a new pad).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and still the curlers were nice and tight.</li>
            <li>These are definitely more comfortable to use and pinch 95% less than my old pair.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are pretty... decent.</li>
            <li>The padded finger holes are a nice touch, a little added luxury.  </li>
            <li>The body of the curler is a little longer than others that I own.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how this works, but I wish I found it years ago, I would have saved so much time curling and recurling my straight beyond straight and stubborn eye lashes.  </li>
            <li>to my surprise, it really is everything they claim.</li>
            <li>Joints open and close smoothly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used an eyelash curler because I have straight eyelashes</li>
            <li>My lashes tend to go straight out and rub against my glasses if not curled.  </li>
            <li>Really makes a difference on my lashes</li>
            <li>not so much.  </li>
            <li>Then just last week the curler itself fell apart and is no longer usable and the available date of return has come and gone.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t damage my lashes so I apply as much pressure as I need.</li>
            <li>It does not crinkle your eyelashes but actually gently curls them.</li>
            <li>handle is comfortable, fits in hand well and is very simple to use.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>This curler is very well made for the money and is a must have for your makeup bag.</li>
            <li>It makes them so much easier to hold on to and use and they don&#x27;t slip.</li>
            <li>Have never found one I have like as much.</li>
            <li>I could tell immediately that this curler is made very well.</li>
            <li>I have used an eyelash curler ever since I was in high school!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s that I hold them incorrectly or just because I buy cheap ones from the dollar store because I assume they are all the same.</li>
            <li>I really like the pad too.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Fast shipping/delivery.</li>
            <li>such a smooth movement.</li>
            <li>Really like this eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate that I don&#x27;t have to replace the rubber pad.</li>
            <li>They really don’t, but I am still giving them 4 stars because they work.</li>
            <li>I try not to use much eye makeup......</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping that I really won&#x27;t have to replace the silicon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it kept my lashes curled for the whole day.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>The curler itself seems really well made.  </li>
            <li>I find that it curls my lashes much faster and seems to be a stronger hold.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready for my day.</li>
            <li>my photos below, you will see the photo of how well it curled my lashes, and it REALLY opens up my eyes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they curl really well.</li>
            <li>I was even asked if they were my real eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>Gentle, well padded.</li>
            <li>curls very well but pinches skin on the corner of eyes.</li>
            <li>works very well--</li>
            <li>They are also very durable.</li>
            <li>really like this curler and will be ordering one for my sister and my mom.</li>
            <li>It really works very well.</li>
            <li>Getting ready to go out.</li>
            <li>They are compact enough to fit into your makeup bag or purse</li>
            <li>It has a very sleek design with a shiny</li>
            <li>Years ago a person was able to purchase an eyelash curler and then later refill rubbers when the old ones wore out.........</li>
            <li>Only because of my professional background and the research I have to do for my clients, I would love to know how</li>
            <li>It does feel sturdy and offers good control and the hyperelastic silicon pad does not leave a crease so with regular cleaning, this should last the life of the curler.</li>
            <li>It is true when they say that the pad goes right back to normal after using, there is no crease in it at all</li>
            <li>WOW!!!  </li>
            <li>Much better than any other eyelash curler I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>And so I can&#x27;t tell that this eyelash curler works any better and the other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to count so that when you go to your other eye</li>
            <li>I received this liveWIRE professional grade eyelash curler for free* to try and review, and I was really hoping that they would have something special to them that would make them stand out from other pairs that I have tried.</li>
            <li>Not sure about all the hype, but it works as promised and if it really lasts I&#x27;ll be thrilled.</li>
            <li>I even received a separate e-mail telling me of the lifetime satisfaction and how to properly use and clean them.</li>
            <li>curled really nice and left my lashes curled for a long time.</li>
            <li>I apply mascara right after I curl my lashes and my lashes look exactly the same at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>These are pretty resistant and spring right back after you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the first eyelash curler I&#x27;ve ever tried and I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>The no pinch claim is true but you have to know how to use the curler properly.</li>
            <li>things first, I like having professional tools in my makeup case.</li>
            <li>I love that you don&#x27;t have to replace the black rubber bar -- because it isn&#x27;t rubber, so it doesn&#x27;t cut itself.  </li>
            <li>It opened and closed fairly easy as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different generic brands and they never produce long-lasting curls.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m older...</li>
            <li>This one will sit in my drawer and I am still in search of a decent eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>I imagine that&#x27;s more to do with different eye shapes being compatible with different curlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The main reason I bought this product is because it claimed to never needing refills, so</li>
            <li>and it’s super simple to use, then toss in your bag for tomorrow.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Given that I have fairly small hands, it takes more effort to open up the curler and it just doesn&#x27;t feel comfortable.</li>
            <li>Ordered it for my wife and she is enjoying it and says it works very well and is expecting it to last a long time.</li>
            <li>The silicone really does bounce right back up.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t crimp too tightly since my lashes will touch the top of my brow and there is sometimes transference of mascara.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this curler.</li>
            <li>I got it with a high discount code.</li>
            <li>and high quality</li>
            <li>I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I highly doubt I will ever need to use that warranty.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to add to your beauty routine.</li>
            <li>This is better and needs far less pressure to curl my straight lashes.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t notice a big difference in the curler itself in comparison to other lash curlers.</li>
            <li>The little cushion is a lot nicer than most curlers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Plus, you don’t have to worry about buying and replacing those little pads like with most curlers.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be a smart buy because refills in general seem to have disappeared from stores (who wants to buy a whole new curler every time it needs new refills??).  </li>
            <li>So far this one has worked really well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought really expensive eyelash curlers and could now kick myself for paying for a name and not getting a great product like this one.</li>
            <li>Worth the extra cost in the savings on replacement pads alone.</li>
            <li>However, there are so many that are a waste of money.</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s just normal loss for me.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, my review is true and honest and not driven by receiving the product for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I suppose this is good so that you don’t have to replace the pad, but I usually store mine open</li>
            <li>They have circles for your fingers that are similar to most other eye lash curlers you see out there, and I don’t see anything about them that makes them more ergonomic than any other pair on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Been using this curler for a few months now, and I love it.</li>
            <li>I have a fold on my upper eyelids that gives my eyes a distinct almond shape, and makes eye makeup somewhat of a challenge.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;ll have to give it another few weeks to really be able to tell.</li>
            <li>I Love that this curler because the little insert springs right back into place.</li>
            <li>Not hard on my lashes and curls them so well.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the only reason I would buy the cheap ones really, it was just as simple to buy a brand new pair than trying to get new refills.</li>
            <li>Honestly, you could pick up a curler of similar quality at the drugstore for half the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After posting my previous review LiveWire was kind enough to send me out a new curler.</li>
            <li>The pad appears to be high quality, unlike my old eyelash curler that even with replacement pads goes flat so quickly.</li>
            <li>It easily opens and clamps down.</li>
            <li>The silicone insert does fit in other curlers</li>
            <li>-close mechanism not as smooth as other curlers</li>
            <li>The pad is durable but it will need to be replaced...or in this case you will need a new curler after 5-6 months.</li>
            <li>Also the product packaging was opened when it arrived so I don&#x27;t think it was in new condition.</li>
            <li>I just got my lashes applied yesterday and decided today to try out my new livewire Eyelash Curler</li>
            <li>I like trying new beauty products and since this was so well reviewed</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, I&#x27;ll explain why I was looking for a new curler.  </li>
            <li>I was in the market for a new eyelash curler and came across the liveWIRE beauty model.  </li>
            <li>so I decided why not - I needed a new one anyway.  </li>
            <li>Then the curler eventually gets out of alignment and I have to find a new one.</li>
            <li>I like to insert new replacement pads because I use the curler with mascara on</li>
            <li>It fits comfortably in my hand and gives me the control I need to get the inner lashes ,  as well as the outer,  at the same time.  </li>
            <li>: The only thing that I do not like about this curler is that it doesn&#x27;t open and close smoothly.</li>
            <li>This professional eyelash curler by liveWIRE is a decent eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>but it is even better when you can get beauty minus the actual pain.</li>
            <li>The pad is very soft and doesn&#x27;t tear or anything</li>
            <li>would still recommend cleaning it with a very gentle cleanser occasionally, as I do with all my beauty products that are washable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They give me that extra little boost that I want without taking much time and, even better, without any pain or irritation.</li>
            <li>They give me that extra little boost that I want without taking much time and, even better, without any pain or irritation.</li>
            <li>My only criticism is the curler does not open any wider than most standard curlers.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny because when I was younger I used to get complimented on my lashes (and my eyes)</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s way better than buying a $4 dollar one every few months considering this product doesn&#x27;t ever need refills!</li>
            <li>I have tried many from cheap to the professional expensive ones.</li>
            <li>I used it on bare lashes and it didn&#x27;t really curl.</li>
            <li>and it seems to work pretty well with my asian eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Would definitely buy this again and tell anyone who is interested about it.</li>
            <li>I could not be Happier with my LiveWire Professional Eyelash Curler!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on the hunt again to find refills for my old curler!</li>
            <li>I finally found the gentle trick to my new longer eyelashes!</li>
            <li>As someone with autoimmune arthritis at a young age, it can be difficult to curl my eyelashes, but the rubber inside the handles is amazing!</li>
            <li>Most curlers press in at some point around my eyes due to the design (or maybe it&#x27;s the &#x27;design&#x27; of MY eyes!), especially on the outer sides lower area.</li>
            <li>Obviously, that would save money over the long run, so I am assuming that&#x27;s why the higher price point than most other eyelash curls that are closer to half the price and work pretty much just as well.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable to use--does not pinch or pull or destroy my eyeliner!!  </li>
            <li>Also the black piece where you press your lashes can be removed to clean if you curl your lashes with mascara on.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes have a natural look, not bent looking.</li>
            <li>This is by far the gentlest curler I have used.</li>
            <li>I have very short, straight eyelashes</li>
            <li>All I know is I&#x27;ve been using eyelash curlers for nearly 15 years and nothing compares to this one.</li>
            <li>I could not wait to try this Professional Eyelash Curler from liveWIRE</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t almost poked my eyes out dropping them, and that to me is great!&lt;br</li>
            <li>However I was pleasantly surprised by this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to wear mascara as it bothers my sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>It makes a eyelashes look naturally curled.  </li>
            <li>When I measured the extension, it was 4&amp;#34; from the outermost part of the handles (where your fingers go through), whereas my old Revlon curler measures 3.5&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use too much pressure to curl my lashes (just enough for it to create a curl), yet the line formed anyway.</li>
            <li>This has so far alevated my dislike of that process.  </li>
            <li>I am going to be 50 years old this year and have been curling my lashes since I&#x27;m 14.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a makeup professional by any means</li>
            <li>I have short eyelashes that stick straight out no curl.</li>
            <li>Wow, so this eyelash curler doesn&#x27;t pinch.</li>
            <li>LiveWire Beauty Professional Eyelash Curler has solved my problem.</li>
            <li>I received my professional eyelash curler with a discount.</li>
            <li>The pad after using bounce right back up to it starting place.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pull or feel harsh on your lashes due to the nice and soft padding on the curler.</li>
            <li>It truly curled my eye lashes easily, making them look so long, made my eyes look wider, less tired, more youthful, less saggy, more alert, refreshed and thicker.</li>
            <li>I now heat the unit in hot water - wipe it dry - then curl.  </li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if they helped or hindered, but after a few uses, I think that they help, making it easier to keep a steadier grip.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m still uncertain how cleanly that would be after a few years</li>
            <li>I left my eye makeup on for three days in a row (I know, gross), just to test it out, and my lashes stayed curled the whole time!</li>
            <li>do have a decent pad to them that has seem to be springing back no matter</li>
            <li>I noticed the high reviews and proceeded to read several that supported the claims</li>
            <li>: You can either aim your hairdryer on low heat at the curling pad for about 30 seconds, or aim it at your eyelashes as you curl, and this will give you a little extra OOMPH and even more</li>
            <li>If the pad does ever wear out (although I really I don&#x27;t see how it couldn&#x27;t after a long time of use), you can contact the company for a replacement.</li>
            <li>This curler really does not pinch and makes my lashes look so long.</li>
            <li>There were no instructions, but I&#x27;m assuming that means that it can be washed and it will retain its original shape rather than eventually get flattened down like regular ones do,</li>
            <li>Well this certainly did not live up to the expectations I had after reading the customers reviews.  </li>
            <li>The spring back of the bumper appears to live up to it&#x27;s claims and should never need replaced.</li>
            <li>I appreciate the customer service, but can&#x27;t give the product 5 stars since it didn&#x27;t live up to its claim of never needing a replacement pad - which is the only reason I purchased the product.</li>
            <li>which I only replaced because I couldn&#x27;t find new inserts for it).  </li>
            <li>I have very long lashes that I have been curling for about 30 years, so I am well seasoned regarding curling lashes (and curlers themselves), and this is definitely not the &#x27;be all to end all&#x27; in the eyelash curler department.  </li>
            <li>Ive tried so  many techniques and wear down the little smooshy foam inside.</li>
            <li>I like eyelash curlers in general, but haven&#x27;t used one until i received this one.</li>
            <li>I have long enough lashes, but I have to really keep them in the curler for while before they curl.</li>
            <li>apparently in this &amp;#34;throwaway world&amp;#34; that is not the case anymore.  </li>
            <li>went back to my old reliable Revlon curler.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s back to my old brand.</li>
            <li>I attached pictures of it next to my old Revlon curler to illustrate the difference.  </li>
            <li>Of course if you try pushing it into your eyelid far enough, it will pinch.</li>
            <li>So far, this is the only curler that has lifted my eyelashes so well</li>
            <li>This curler surprised me because when I was using it, I actually had to keep checking in the mirror to see if my eyelashes were IN it, because I didn&#x27;t feel anything.</li>
            <li>I am using it daily, and have been since I received it back in February, but it&#x27;s really only because I paid so much for it.</li>
            <li>The angle of the curler is different than my old one, so maybe that&#x27;s why it was pinching?  </li>
            <li>This works great and is a very sturdy product I suggest to anyone looking to buy a new or get their frist eye lash curler to get this one you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li>Only recently, I ran out of the old refill pads for it and can only find the new silicone ones.  </li>
            <li>I love eyelash curlers, and was skeptical trying a new one.</li>
            <li>It does a great job in curling without clumping the eyelashes together like less expensive models do.  </li>
            <li>You can see the mark that the upper metal bar leaves when pressed down on them, but it quickly goes away when left opened.</li>
            <li>I previously had a curler (which I can no longer find) that opened up extra wide, making it easy to capture all wayward eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>It may be that my eyelashes are super straight due to past chemotherapy.</li>
            <li>I had stopped using other ones so much because they were pulling out my lashes and pinching my eyelids,  but this one did none of that.  </li>
            <li>It is much easier to use than other eye lash curlers I have had.  </li>
            <li>I hope to have this one for a long, long time as I can&#x27;t afford much anymore</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have very thick or long lashes and curling them makes them more noticeable, and opens my eyes up.  </li>
            <li>It remains to be seen if the pad will continue to bounce back after a very long period of daily use, but so far I am hopeful that this curler will do what they say and never need replacing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m having a little trouble getting used to this curler but after using Maybelline for so many years, I guess that&#x27;s to be expected as it&#x27;s shape</li>

            <li> I did receive this as a sample to review and give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I would test it out and give you my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice because it doesn&#x27;t pinch or pull on my lashes while I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li> It has a really nice silicone pad that keeps it&#x27;s shape and my lashes don&#x27;t get stuck on it, so it&#x27;s painless.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems to work ok.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I can&#x27;t get my lashes to curl nicely with it.</li>
            <li> Produces a nice curl.</li>
            <li> This really IS the best eyelash curler I have EVER used!!</li>
            <li> They looked so nice.</li>

            <li> /&gt;It fits nice on your fingers and once the ladies got the hang of the motion required, there was no pinching or pulling of the eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another trick I have heard was to warm the curler with a hair dryer to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; the curl, I haven&#x27;t tried it</li>
            <li> Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I think this is a good eyelash curler, but I think they would sell a lot better if they lowered the price point a bit.</li>

            <li> I been on the search for the perfect eyelash curler that won&#x27;t pinch, shaped for Asian eyes, and does not need replacement pads.</li>
            <li> so it might work better if you have wider, more almond shaped eyes.</li>
            <li> I am glad I purchased this one for sure.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Eyelashes stay curled :)</li>
            <li> Completely love this eyelash curler</li>
            <li> and i would love to not have to replace the cushion.</li>
            <li> It has more give and bounce to it,  than the others I have purchased.  </li>
            <li> I used to have a Revlon curler that worked much better.</li>
            <li> and I have tried so many eyelash curlers</li>
            <li> and they were ok</li>
            <li> The packaging was adorable, though it was a bit squished when it arrived.</li>
            <li> I was able to curl my eye lashes without any pain or ripping of my lil hairs and</li>
            <li> and I love how it makes my lashes look</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely product.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for me that there is no replacement necessary, I can use this forever now!  </li>
            <li> The curler does not pinch or pull, but I don&#x27;t think it curls lashes any better than the cheaper ones sold at drugstores.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of never replacing the pads</li>
            <li> love it..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and in all my life using a eyelash curler have NEVER found one better.</li>
            <li> I very much love this eyelash curler.  </li>
            <li> And it makes my eye lashes look curled more.</li>
            <li> While it took a bit of getting used to the pad, now I love this curler.  </li>
            <li> Love Amazon and your curler.  </li>
            <li> It worked like a charm. :)</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love how it curls my lashes in no time, and with my mascara</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pinch like most eyelash curlers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to curl my lashes without having to contort my hands and fingers to get a &amp;#34;good angle&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that the pad is not a foamy material so it doesn&#x27;t collect makeup.</li>
            <li> Love that I don&#x27;t need to replace the pad</li>
            <li> Love this eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for not pulling my lashes out, just a simple curl</li>
            <li> It curls better than all others and without any pain or pulling on your lashes or the surrounding area.  </li>
            <li> Would buy it again (but it doesn&#x27;t look like I will need to) :)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m always looking for things to make my eyes look better.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product</li>
            <li> Will be ordering more as gifts.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>

            <li> Okay ladies, who keeps one of these tools in their makeup box?</li>
            <li> Not that they’re always better, but if I know what I’m</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been doing it more often than not, even if its just to &amp;#34;open my eyes&amp;#34; when I&#x27;m not planning on wearing makeup.  </li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already shared with all my sisters :)</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure it will serve its purpose when i do.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that you don&#x27;t have to replace the pad.</li>

            <li> The best I have ever had -- probably will last me a life time,</li>
            <li> I really love this tool.</li>

            <li> in all, I am in love with this eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> in all, I am in love with this eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> and I must say at first I didn&#x27;t think my eyelashes was even in the curler but to my pleasant surprise when I checked the mirror just to be sure</li>
            <li> It is professional quality, durable, nice looking, works perfect, great price, comes with a LIFETIME true warranty backing it completely and company even followed up making sure</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, and it curls my eyelashes quickly!</li>
            <li> Well simply stated - I LOVE IT!!!  </li>
            <li> but so far so good!</li>
            <li> So far, so good!</li>
            <li> but so far so good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m REALLY impressed with this curler, you don&#x27;t even have to even squeeze too hard to get a nice curl!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend and am so happy with these.</li>
            <li> Excellent - night and day compared to my cheap Sally H. one -- they might look the same but this one is VERY comfortable and never pinches my eyelid.  </li>
            <li> What I love most about this product is its slim yet sturdy design that provides you with a quality finished look and the curler fits easily into any makeup bag.</li>
            <li> The LiveWire Eyelash comes in super cute packaging and does a nice job of curling my lashes.</li>
            <li> and I had a pretty good curl going on .it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month, and it works just as good as it did the first time, and that&#x27;s using it every day.  </li>
            <li> When I got a chance to get this on a promotion I was so excited to give it a try!  </li>
            <li> Super nice eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I think this a good curler simply for doing a good job of curling my lashes and not ever requiring refills.</li>
            <li> They take care of each customer in a very special way.</li>
            <li> Working great so far!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is my opinion that this is definitely a professional quality eyelash curler that can be used on anyone and the silicone pad makes it easy and painless to have beautiful lashes.</li>
            <li> I was able to get this eyelash curler for free to review as part of a promotion.</li>
            <li> most importantly, it DOESN&#x27;T pinch you nor does it pull your eyelashes off.  </li>
            <li> You know instantly the first time you use it, it feels different, it curls perfectly, it&#x27;s made well &amp; best of all....</li>
            <li> and my lashes got a great natural looking curl from them.</li>
            <li> most reviews were written in exchange for a free curler.  </li>
            <li> Do not hesitate to try this curler - truly fabulous and I am so glad I took the time to research and settle on this one...  </li>
            <li> but I use it almost every day and so far I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
            <li> There are grips on the spots you put your figures in making it so much more comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> The curl is really good, almost too much of a curl.</li>
            <li> received this complimentary product for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I really loved this eyelash curler, but it didn&#x27;t really stand the test of time.</li>
            <li> A representative from the company emailed me soon after it was delivered and told some good tips for how to use and maintain it, which was very helpful.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s easy to use with soft bumpers that create great curl.  </li>
            <li> was an easy product to work with.</li>
            <li> I had no problems with how my fingers easily slid into the handle.</li>
            <li> Having said that, these didn&#x27;t pinch, and it&#x27;s easy to see the eyelashes appear through the curler</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and does the job.</li>
            <li> it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> There is no pinching and it easily lengthens and separates my lashes.</li>
            <li> I love the no-slip padded grip handles, the nicely padded curler pad that never needs replacing and is gentle on your lashes.</li>
            <li> No pinching, no cutting (!) and perfect lashes every time.</li>
            <li> I also like that it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t pinch or pull out eyelashes, keeps them curled all day...</li>
            <li> The curler is easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to use, even with arthritis in my hands.</li>
            <li> easy to grip too.</li>
            <li> It is extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li> The handles are textured for a non-slip grip which makes primping really easy.</li>
            <li> The grips have a bit of a &amp;#34;rubber&amp;#34; smell to them, though not overly strong.</li>
            <li> One 7 second pump is all it takes for lashes that stay beautifully curled all day.  </li>
            <li> It actually curls perfectly the first go around.  </li>
            <li> That helps to make the process easy and pain free.</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t pinch at all, but curled my eyelashes just fine.</li>
            <li> They arrived quickly, and the company followed up with an email to check they arrived OK.</li>
            <li> So far very happy with my new curler, it doesn&#x27;t pinch or crease my lashes.</li>
            <li> The little pad is cushy and hasn&#x27;t flatten out like most pads.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s huge for me.  </li>
            <li> ever since I started curling my lashes again, I have noticed a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LiveWIRE</li>
            <li> This is comfortable to use</li>
            <li> This eye lash curler feels comfortable in your finger while using it.</li>
            <li> If you have larger eyes , as mine are almond shaped it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous eyelash curler.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job actually curling my lashes.</li>
            <li> And let me say this again because it is so important for me, reaches and curls all lashes without pinching and pulling in one try.</li>
            <li> The handle and the ergonomic design make it comfortable to hold and use.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and easier to clean as well.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lash curler about 2 weeks and so far, so good.</li>
            <li> I used a little warm water and soap to clean it and it held up great.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and doesn&#x27;t punch at All!!</li>

            <li> highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to add to my review by posting some pictures and adding I also liked the finger holes having a rubber like lining it makes it softer on the fingers to use.</li>
            <li> so was excited about this product.  </li>
            <li> Which is why I was excited to get a chance to review it.</li>
            <li> I also felt pretty safe using it, because I was worried it would damage my lashes or pull them out, but I don’t think it’s going to happen with this product.</li>
            <li> Totally worth every penny!</li>
            <li> so this curler is an easy way to make my eyelashes look pretty!</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t curl any better than my regular curler, but it&#x27;s nice to never have to buy a refill.</li>
            <li> they are very lightweight and the handles also work very well allowing good grip.</li>
            <li> It comes in really cute pink packaging which the girls loved.</li>
            <li> Professional Eyelash Culer by LiveWire Beauty is my FAVORITE!</li>
            <li> Loving it so far!</li>
            <li> I only have 4 others to compare it too and can honestly say is a pretty nice curler.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, good results, do not anticipate any problems with it long term.</li>
            <li> What makes this eye lash curler so special?</li>
            <li> , right?!  </li>
            <li> If eye shadow got on the curler, it was super easy to wipe right off.</li>
            <li> The next day I tried about 3 times and I was about to get one eye to look good.</li>
            <li> I received the Professional Eyelash Curler from liveWIRE beauty to try and give my honest opinion</li>
            <li> It works good for my short eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I hope it&#x27;s true that I will never need refills.</li>
            <li> The split was actually full of pulled eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the same Revlon curler for probably 20 years and have loved it.  </li>
            <li> and I regularly clean them with a q-tip and some eye makeup remover, then a quick rinse and a thorough drying</li>
            <li> Overall, good product.</li>
            <li> Overall this curler does a good job, but don&#x27;t buy into the hype that it never pinches ..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Every time I get ready to go either to work or to go out on a date, I always make sure that I look put together</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, but it does pinch.</li>
            <li> you didn’t grow up learning how to use one of these, let me explain quickly that most folks have fairly straight lashes.</li>
            <li> Pretty cool!</li>
            <li> And, we know as we get older, these are very important for our eyes to &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; and keep youthful in appearance.</li>
            <li> As promised, my eyelids didn&#x27;t get pinched and the process was pretty easy.</li>
            <li> , however I am not finding it to be as great as the other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> best of all it lasted my whole 10 hour shift with just a little mascara.</li>
            <li> I love my new eyelash curler from livewire!</li>
            <li> Love this new find!</li>
            <li> curls quickly and evenly.</li>
            <li> I found a $3.00 one at Target that actually works much better, is a better eye shape...</li>
            <li> This curler worked great on my short , straight lashes.  </li>
            <li> T!hankyou for a quick delivery</li>
            <li> These helped me to create more of an open eye look that I love.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes have been falling out since being pregnant with my babies.</li>
            <li> super super superrrr</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull, curls well, and if the claim that the rubber never needs replaced is true, well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a really good eyelash curler for a long time.</li>
            <li> I had a good one for a long time but it broke...</li>
            <li> It gives a nice curl without too much effort, you don&#x27;t have to sit there holding it for what seems like forever to get a decent curl.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s double the price of a decent curler (my Tweezerman one was about $7-8) which is a great deal considering you&#x27;ll never have to get refills.</li>
            <li> are my new favorite.</li>
            <li> And if I could the refills they would be more expesive than a new curler.  </li>
            <li> I love my new liveWIRE eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> it has become my new favorite</li>
            <li> My favorite eyelash curler by far!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I grew up using one, but my daughters didn’t even know what it was at first!</li>
            <li> I hope my personal experiences help you get the most out of yours!</li>
            <li> eyelash curler is an awesome product that comes in this cute black, purple, and pink packaging.</li>
            <li> I was excited about all the positive reviews here...</li>
            <li> I did NOT get this for free, but if LIVEWire Beauty wants to send me any products to try....</li>
            <li> I really like the rubber grips on the handles because it makes this curler comfortable to grip.</li>
            <li> These are good light weight but not cheap.</li>
            <li> It really felt comfortably holding between my fingers.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that I won&#x27;t have to replace the pad.&lt;br /&gt;The service was fast and accurate.</li>
            <li> I was offered this curler complimentary in exchange</li>
            <li> maybe a road tar mixed with plastic kind of smell?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of gross and chemically, but not a deal</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was not blessed with long gorgeous lashes, but with this handy curler I had noticeable longer eyelashes on the first try using just regular mascara.</li>
            <li> Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> The curling action of this product is just okay.</li>
            <li> I received this complimentary product from the seller in order to review it for their company.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> but I do use a fair amount of makeup every day and curling my eyelashes was one of my least favorite parts.  </li>
            <li> So I honestly didn&#x27;t think that this would be any different, but I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Bought it based on reviews expecting to be worth the money spend ..</li>
            <li> Effective, but I&#x27;m Asian w/short lashes</li>
            <li> It has a nice, wide curling surface that allows me to rest it against my cheek comfortably to do the deed.</li>
            <li> So glad I purchased this to replace my old one that I have had forever.</li>
            <li> After several uses, I can honestly say that it helped give my lashes a fuller, curvier curl.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> And for $15.00, it&#x27;s got to be worth it</li>
            <li> This curler has worked better than all others I have tried, but it is still not what I would consider a genuine curl, more of a very slight flare.</li>
            <li> I read the description and was most attracted to the &amp;#34;never needs refill pads&amp;#34; which was exactly the reason I was shopping for a new curler.  </li>
            <li> What little mascara comes off on the curler wipes off easily after a quick rinse under warm water.</li>
            <li> I was able to get my lashes curled better than my other curler and they looked longer.</li>
            <li> The company followup is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;For a small company, the customer service is as good as Zappos or Apple, perhaps even better.  </li>
            <li> : I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased review.lashes first to give them that extra boost and definition and then apply some mascara afterwards to give them a bit more volume and darkening them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> I did it for about 10 times one day and couldn&#x27;t get them right.</li>
            <li> This curler let&#x27;s me get right up to the root of my lash without pinching.</li>
            <li> but if u position it the right way you won&#x27;t get pinched.</li>
            <li> They are right when they say it does not pinch.</li>
            <li> It curls just the right amount.</li>
            <li> This curler I simply place my lashes in, squeeze the handle down, and all of my lashes are perfectly in place.</li>
            <li> I may have over curled them the first time so just be aware of that!</li>
            <li> My first experience with using this curler is very positive and the price was right.  </li>
            <li> much recommend, and I appreciate receiving this in exchange for my true and unbiased opinion</li>
            <li> the new pad kept coming out, wouldn&#x27;t fit quite right, etc.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;grippies&amp;#34; on the handles are soft and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> As you can see in the picture, the handles of the LiveWire curler (left) form almost a 90 degree angle, but the front handle of the Revlon curler (right) is bent to create more like a 60 degree angle.</li>
            <li> I love this eyelash curler - the pad springs right back after use and it seems that it holds up well.  </li>
            <li> The true proof of a product is how long it will last, so if this pad really lasts for life, it will be a great product.</li>
            <li> But so far it works fine.</li>
            <li> Feels good to support a little company</li>
            <li> fast delivery too!</li>
            <li> The price is somewhat on the higher side but If need be I would buy the product again again.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I really recommend these!</li>
            <li> First it does pinch eyelids.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t do a better job of curling eyelids than the crappy $3 curlers you can buy at Wal*mart or similar.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to move it several times to make sure I could angle in all the lashes.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> For, who wants to continually be replacing pads and keeping up with the replacements?!</li>
            <li> I use my professional eyelash curler everyday and I have gotten so many compliments on how nice my lashes look.</li>
            <li> It does the thing where the outer lashes curl more than the middle ones.&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first I thought, &amp;#34;Are</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to do.  </li>
            <li> It did pinch me more than my regular eyelash curlers</li>
            <li> These work very well!</li>
            <li> It does not pinch my eyes (almond-shaped), although I&#x27;m sure it could if I just wasn&#x27;t lined up properly.</li>
            <li> I have tried many curlers over the years, and this is the first one I&#x27;ve found that actually WORKS!!!  </li>
            <li> Thanks!  </li>
            <li> Pinched my eyelids and it really hurts!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I received a response from the rep and they offered to refund my entire purchase on top of sending replacement pads.</li>
            <li> First time I used it, I took a &#x27;before&#x27; picture (included).  </li>
            <li> The first one I ordered I paid almost $20</li>
            <li> It seems that the first curler I received had been defective, and wasn&#x27;t closing correctly.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> First one ever</li>
            <li> using is the same I’d get in a salon, I figure I’m better off getting the job done.</li>
            <li> By using an eyelash curler, you can curl them so your eyes look more “open” and alert.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It curls on the first time.</li>
            <li> It never gets sticky my other one did either which I love!</li>
            <li> and it never pulls my lashes, which is why I stopped curling them in the first place.  </li>
            <li> Now, I curl my lashes first to give them that extra boost and definition and then apply some mascara afterwards to give them a bit more volume and darkening them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have so much stuff in my make up back and purse all the time a lot of my beauty items easily get destroyed, not these babies!</li>
            <li> It is everything other people have already commented on and more... simple to use, effective, and</li>
            <li> This curler has a very professional look to it and it fit very well in my hands.  </li>
            <li> Also, seller gives other beauty tips which was nice.</li>
            <li> LiveWIRE needs to bring the price down for sure &amp; full disclosure</li>
            <li> Wow right!</li>
            <li> Many brands claim to come with LIFETIME warranties or replacements and you find out quickly why, they are not worth it and need to keep replacing.</li>
            <li> At my age, I have tried, bought and used many with most being a complete waste of money and hurting my eyes in the process.</li>
            <li> I have very small thin eyelashes, with this and the perfect mascara, I have big beautiful plump eyelashes</li>
            <li> I actually really love this eyelash curler because it makes my eyelashes look really long.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and works very well!</li>
            <li> I love the silicon pad - so much better than other brands that cut and fall apart after a short period of time.  </li>
            <li> This curler is easy to operate and doesn&#x27;t require any replacement pads, so that’s a big plus.</li>
            <li> Others I have used certainly do.</li>
            <li> This one did seem to grip my eyelashes a bit better than my current one and that may be the silicone (or it could be mine needs a new pad).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and still the curlers were nice and tight.</li>
            <li> These are definitely more comfortable to use and pinch 95% less than my old pair.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are pretty... decent.</li>
            <li> The padded finger holes are a nice touch, a little added luxury.  </li>
            <li> The body of the curler is a little longer than others that I own.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this works, but I wish I found it years ago, I would have saved so much time curling and recurling my straight beyond straight and stubborn eye lashes.  </li>
            <li> to my surprise, it really is everything they claim.</li>
            <li> Joints open and close smoothly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used an eyelash curler because I have straight eyelashes</li>
            <li> My lashes tend to go straight out and rub against my glasses if not curled.  </li>
            <li> Really makes a difference on my lashes</li>
            <li> not so much.  </li>
            <li> Then just last week the curler itself fell apart and is no longer usable and the available date of return has come and gone.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t damage my lashes so I apply as much pressure as I need.</li>
            <li> It does not crinkle your eyelashes but actually gently curls them.</li>
            <li> handle is comfortable, fits in hand well and is very simple to use.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> This curler is very well made for the money and is a must have for your makeup bag.</li>
            <li> It makes them so much easier to hold on to and use and they don&#x27;t slip.</li>
            <li> Have never found one I have like as much.</li>
            <li> I could tell immediately that this curler is made very well.</li>
            <li> I have used an eyelash curler ever since I was in high school!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s that I hold them incorrectly or just because I buy cheap ones from the dollar store because I assume they are all the same.</li>
            <li> I really like the pad too.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Fast shipping/delivery.</li>
            <li> such a smooth movement.</li>
            <li> Really like this eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate that I don&#x27;t have to replace the rubber pad.</li>
            <li> They really don’t, but I am still giving them 4 stars because they work.</li>
            <li> I try not to use much eye makeup......</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that I really won&#x27;t have to replace the silicon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it kept my lashes curled for the whole day.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> The curler itself seems really well made.  </li>
            <li> I find that it curls my lashes much faster and seems to be a stronger hold.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready for my day.</li>
            <li> my photos below, you will see the photo of how well it curled my lashes, and it REALLY opens up my eyes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they curl really well.</li>
            <li> I was even asked if they were my real eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> Gentle, well padded.</li>
            <li> curls very well but pinches skin on the corner of eyes.</li>
            <li> works very well--</li>
            <li> They are also very durable.</li>
            <li> really like this curler and will be ordering one for my sister and my mom.</li>
            <li> It really works very well.</li>
            <li> Getting ready to go out.</li>
            <li> They are compact enough to fit into your makeup bag or purse</li>
            <li> It has a very sleek design with a shiny</li>
            <li> Years ago a person was able to purchase an eyelash curler and then later refill rubbers when the old ones wore out.........</li>
            <li> Only because of my professional background and the research I have to do for my clients, I would love to know how</li>
            <li> It does feel sturdy and offers good control and the hyperelastic silicon pad does not leave a crease so with regular cleaning, this should last the life of the curler.</li>
            <li> It is true when they say that the pad goes right back to normal after using, there is no crease in it at all</li>
            <li> WOW!!!  </li>
            <li> Much better than any other eyelash curler I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> And so I can&#x27;t tell that this eyelash curler works any better and the other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to count so that when you go to your other eye</li>
            <li> I received this liveWIRE professional grade eyelash curler for free* to try and review, and I was really hoping that they would have something special to them that would make them stand out from other pairs that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Not sure about all the hype, but it works as promised and if it really lasts I&#x27;ll be thrilled.</li>
            <li> I even received a separate e-mail telling me of the lifetime satisfaction and how to properly use and clean them.</li>
            <li> curled really nice and left my lashes curled for a long time.</li>
            <li> I apply mascara right after I curl my lashes and my lashes look exactly the same at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> These are pretty resistant and spring right back after you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the first eyelash curler I&#x27;ve ever tried and I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> The no pinch claim is true but you have to know how to use the curler properly.</li>
            <li> things first, I like having professional tools in my makeup case.</li>
            <li> I love that you don&#x27;t have to replace the black rubber bar -- because it isn&#x27;t rubber, so it doesn&#x27;t cut itself.  </li>
            <li> It opened and closed fairly easy as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different generic brands and they never produce long-lasting curls.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m older...</li>
            <li> This one will sit in my drawer and I am still in search of a decent eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> I imagine that&#x27;s more to do with different eye shapes being compatible with different curlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The main reason I bought this product is because it claimed to never needing refills, so</li>
            <li> and it’s super simple to use, then toss in your bag for tomorrow.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Given that I have fairly small hands, it takes more effort to open up the curler and it just doesn&#x27;t feel comfortable.</li>
            <li> Ordered it for my wife and she is enjoying it and says it works very well and is expecting it to last a long time.</li>
            <li> The silicone really does bounce right back up.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t crimp too tightly since my lashes will touch the top of my brow and there is sometimes transference of mascara.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this curler.</li>
            <li> I got it with a high discount code.</li>
            <li> and high quality</li>
            <li> I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I highly doubt I will ever need to use that warranty.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to add to your beauty routine.</li>
            <li> This is better and needs far less pressure to curl my straight lashes.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t notice a big difference in the curler itself in comparison to other lash curlers.</li>
            <li> The little cushion is a lot nicer than most curlers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Plus, you don’t have to worry about buying and replacing those little pads like with most curlers.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a smart buy because refills in general seem to have disappeared from stores (who wants to buy a whole new curler every time it needs new refills??).  </li>
            <li> So far this one has worked really well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought really expensive eyelash curlers and could now kick myself for paying for a name and not getting a great product like this one.</li>
            <li> Worth the extra cost in the savings on replacement pads alone.</li>
            <li> However, there are so many that are a waste of money.</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s just normal loss for me.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, my review is true and honest and not driven by receiving the product for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I suppose this is good so that you don’t have to replace the pad, but I usually store mine open</li>
            <li> They have circles for your fingers that are similar to most other eye lash curlers you see out there, and I don’t see anything about them that makes them more ergonomic than any other pair on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Been using this curler for a few months now, and I love it.</li>
            <li> I have a fold on my upper eyelids that gives my eyes a distinct almond shape, and makes eye makeup somewhat of a challenge.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll have to give it another few weeks to really be able to tell.</li>
            <li> I Love that this curler because the little insert springs right back into place.</li>
            <li> Not hard on my lashes and curls them so well.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only reason I would buy the cheap ones really, it was just as simple to buy a brand new pair than trying to get new refills.</li>
            <li> Honestly, you could pick up a curler of similar quality at the drugstore for half the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After posting my previous review LiveWire was kind enough to send me out a new curler.</li>
            <li> The pad appears to be high quality, unlike my old eyelash curler that even with replacement pads goes flat so quickly.</li>
            <li> It easily opens and clamps down.</li>
            <li> The silicone insert does fit in other curlers</li>
            <li> -close mechanism not as smooth as other curlers</li>
            <li> The pad is durable but it will need to be replaced...or in this case you will need a new curler after 5-6 months.</li>
            <li> Also the product packaging was opened when it arrived so I don&#x27;t think it was in new condition.</li>
            <li> I just got my lashes applied yesterday and decided today to try out my new livewire Eyelash Curler</li>
            <li> I like trying new beauty products and since this was so well reviewed</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, I&#x27;ll explain why I was looking for a new curler.  </li>
            <li> I was in the market for a new eyelash curler and came across the liveWIRE beauty model.  </li>
            <li> so I decided why not - I needed a new one anyway.  </li>
            <li> Then the curler eventually gets out of alignment and I have to find a new one.</li>
            <li> I like to insert new replacement pads because I use the curler with mascara on</li>
            <li> It fits comfortably in my hand and gives me the control I need to get the inner lashes ,  as well as the outer,  at the same time.  </li>
            <li> : The only thing that I do not like about this curler is that it doesn&#x27;t open and close smoothly.</li>
            <li> This professional eyelash curler by liveWIRE is a decent eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> but it is even better when you can get beauty minus the actual pain.</li>
            <li> The pad is very soft and doesn&#x27;t tear or anything</li>
            <li> would still recommend cleaning it with a very gentle cleanser occasionally, as I do with all my beauty products that are washable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They give me that extra little boost that I want without taking much time and, even better, without any pain or irritation.</li>
            <li> They give me that extra little boost that I want without taking much time and, even better, without any pain or irritation.</li>
            <li> My only criticism is the curler does not open any wider than most standard curlers.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny because when I was younger I used to get complimented on my lashes (and my eyes)</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s way better than buying a $4 dollar one every few months considering this product doesn&#x27;t ever need refills!</li>
            <li> I have tried many from cheap to the professional expensive ones.</li>
            <li> I used it on bare lashes and it didn&#x27;t really curl.</li>
            <li> and it seems to work pretty well with my asian eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Would definitely buy this again and tell anyone who is interested about it.</li>
            <li> I could not be Happier with my LiveWire Professional Eyelash Curler!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the hunt again to find refills for my old curler!</li>
            <li> I finally found the gentle trick to my new longer eyelashes!</li>
            <li> As someone with autoimmune arthritis at a young age, it can be difficult to curl my eyelashes, but the rubber inside the handles is amazing!</li>
            <li> Most curlers press in at some point around my eyes due to the design (or maybe it&#x27;s the &#x27;design&#x27; of MY eyes!), especially on the outer sides lower area.</li>
            <li> Obviously, that would save money over the long run, so I am assuming that&#x27;s why the higher price point than most other eyelash curls that are closer to half the price and work pretty much just as well.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable to use--does not pinch or pull or destroy my eyeliner!!  </li>
            <li> Also the black piece where you press your lashes can be removed to clean if you curl your lashes with mascara on.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes have a natural look, not bent looking.</li>
            <li> This is by far the gentlest curler I have used.</li>
            <li> I have very short, straight eyelashes</li>
            <li> All I know is I&#x27;ve been using eyelash curlers for nearly 15 years and nothing compares to this one.</li>
            <li> I could not wait to try this Professional Eyelash Curler from liveWIRE</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t almost poked my eyes out dropping them, and that to me is great!&lt;br</li>
            <li> However I was pleasantly surprised by this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to wear mascara as it bothers my sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> It makes a eyelashes look naturally curled.  </li>
            <li> When I measured the extension, it was 4&amp;#34; from the outermost part of the handles (where your fingers go through), whereas my old Revlon curler measures 3.5&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use too much pressure to curl my lashes (just enough for it to create a curl), yet the line formed anyway.</li>
            <li> This has so far alevated my dislike of that process.  </li>
            <li> I am going to be 50 years old this year and have been curling my lashes since I&#x27;m 14.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a makeup professional by any means</li>
            <li> I have short eyelashes that stick straight out no curl.</li>
            <li> Wow, so this eyelash curler doesn&#x27;t pinch.</li>
            <li> LiveWire Beauty Professional Eyelash Curler has solved my problem.</li>
            <li> I received my professional eyelash curler with a discount.</li>
            <li> The pad after using bounce right back up to it starting place.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull or feel harsh on your lashes due to the nice and soft padding on the curler.</li>
            <li> It truly curled my eye lashes easily, making them look so long, made my eyes look wider, less tired, more youthful, less saggy, more alert, refreshed and thicker.</li>
            <li> I now heat the unit in hot water - wipe it dry - then curl.  </li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if they helped or hindered, but after a few uses, I think that they help, making it easier to keep a steadier grip.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m still uncertain how cleanly that would be after a few years</li>
            <li> I left my eye makeup on for three days in a row (I know, gross), just to test it out, and my lashes stayed curled the whole time!</li>
            <li> do have a decent pad to them that has seem to be springing back no matter</li>
            <li> I noticed the high reviews and proceeded to read several that supported the claims</li>
            <li> : You can either aim your hairdryer on low heat at the curling pad for about 30 seconds, or aim it at your eyelashes as you curl, and this will give you a little extra OOMPH and even more</li>
            <li> If the pad does ever wear out (although I really I don&#x27;t see how it couldn&#x27;t after a long time of use), you can contact the company for a replacement.</li>
            <li> This curler really does not pinch and makes my lashes look so long.</li>
            <li> There were no instructions, but I&#x27;m assuming that means that it can be washed and it will retain its original shape rather than eventually get flattened down like regular ones do,</li>
            <li> Well this certainly did not live up to the expectations I had after reading the customers reviews.  </li>
            <li> The spring back of the bumper appears to live up to it&#x27;s claims and should never need replaced.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the customer service, but can&#x27;t give the product 5 stars since it didn&#x27;t live up to its claim of never needing a replacement pad - which is the only reason I purchased the product.</li>
            <li> which I only replaced because I couldn&#x27;t find new inserts for it).  </li>
            <li> I have very long lashes that I have been curling for about 30 years, so I am well seasoned regarding curling lashes (and curlers themselves), and this is definitely not the &#x27;be all to end all&#x27; in the eyelash curler department.  </li>
            <li> Ive tried so  many techniques and wear down the little smooshy foam inside.</li>
            <li> I like eyelash curlers in general, but haven&#x27;t used one until i received this one.</li>
            <li> I have long enough lashes, but I have to really keep them in the curler for while before they curl.</li>
            <li> apparently in this &amp;#34;throwaway world&amp;#34; that is not the case anymore.  </li>
            <li> went back to my old reliable Revlon curler.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s back to my old brand.</li>
            <li> I attached pictures of it next to my old Revlon curler to illustrate the difference.  </li>
            <li> Of course if you try pushing it into your eyelid far enough, it will pinch.</li>
            <li> So far, this is the only curler that has lifted my eyelashes so well</li>
            <li> This curler surprised me because when I was using it, I actually had to keep checking in the mirror to see if my eyelashes were IN it, because I didn&#x27;t feel anything.</li>
            <li> I am using it daily, and have been since I received it back in February, but it&#x27;s really only because I paid so much for it.</li>
            <li> The angle of the curler is different than my old one, so maybe that&#x27;s why it was pinching?  </li>
            <li> This works great and is a very sturdy product I suggest to anyone looking to buy a new or get their frist eye lash curler to get this one you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Only recently, I ran out of the old refill pads for it and can only find the new silicone ones.  </li>
            <li> I love eyelash curlers, and was skeptical trying a new one.</li>
            <li> It does a great job in curling without clumping the eyelashes together like less expensive models do.  </li>
            <li> You can see the mark that the upper metal bar leaves when pressed down on them, but it quickly goes away when left opened.</li>
            <li> I previously had a curler (which I can no longer find) that opened up extra wide, making it easy to capture all wayward eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> It may be that my eyelashes are super straight due to past chemotherapy.</li>
            <li> I had stopped using other ones so much because they were pulling out my lashes and pinching my eyelids,  but this one did none of that.  </li>
            <li> It is much easier to use than other eye lash curlers I have had.  </li>
            <li> I hope to have this one for a long, long time as I can&#x27;t afford much anymore</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very thick or long lashes and curling them makes them more noticeable, and opens my eyes up.  </li>
            <li> It remains to be seen if the pad will continue to bounce back after a very long period of daily use, but so far I am hopeful that this curler will do what they say and never need replacing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having a little trouble getting used to this curler but after using Maybelline for so many years, I guess that&#x27;s to be expected as it&#x27;s shape</li>
            <li> I usually just brush a few strokes of mascara on and think it looks fine but</li>
            <li> so I will be following up later to see how long it lasts with daily use.</li>
            <li> I had just broken my eyelash curlers, so when I was selected to review these, I was really excited.</li>
            <li> I thought this might be giving it a distorted and not accurate high rating.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time using and Eyelash Curler and it wasn&#x27;t hard at all to work.</li>
            <li> and I can tell that the pad will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This is looking like it is going to be a long lasting product!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Should last a long time.</li>
            <li> As long as your using it properly, and not against the skin, you won&#x27;t get pinched.</li>
            <li> Only time will tell if it performs as promised over the long term.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get flat or  </li>
            <li> But for my flat lashes, a curler is a must.</li>
            <li> I gave you 5 stars because your product is well made, does not pinch &amp; it&#x27;s long enough.....</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;The silicone didn&#x27;t last as long as I hoped.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t know how long it will last yet</li>
            <li> I went back to my old Revlon curler and bent the metal a little bit with some needle nose pliers to hold the silicone refill in place.  </li>
            <li> The narrow scissor type handle makes it hard to fit my fingers in</li>
            <li> I know they will last me a long time!</li>
            <li> It is more difficult to open and close than other curlers I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I hope they last for a long time!</li>
            <li> Oftentimes with the foamy pads you need to wait for it to dry before the next use.</li>
            <li> I have heard stories of people who actually get their eyelashes ripped off because they&#x27;re not being careful enough, and it scared me, but i still use these.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I was cynical about that, because all the others I have used generally pinch and sometimes my eyelashes stick a little bit to the pad.</li>
            <li> Over the past year I have bought several different curlers because I&#x27;m noticing at nearly 50 my finest asset</li>
            <li> I needed a new curler after using my current one WAAAAY past</li>
            <li> With my whimpy Asian eyelashes, this has been the only eyelash curler that can actually grab them at the base and produce a nice curler without pinching.</li>
            <li> The part you hold seems to go back further than other curlers.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m kinda bad about that kind of thing)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with mascara and eyelash curlers and have tried many in the past good and bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve honestly never had much luck with eyelash curlers.  </li>
            <li> It does take some practice to get your lashes to be long with this eye lash curler.</li>
            <li> The shape itself was too wide and big for my eyes</li>
            <li> It DOES pinch in the inner corners, too, no matter how carefully I place it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since opening it, there has been a strange smell...</li>
            <li> As a state licensed Cosmetologist I have tried everything to achieve my desired long lashes, but no luck.</li>
            <li> It creates a curl that lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> After just a few months it developed a line in the pad, so my lashes started sticking in it and falling out.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are fairly long but refuse to curl.</li>
            <li> It pinches/pull my lashes in a strange way everytime.</li>
            <li> Because as I have aged the weight of my eyelids has pushed against my eyelash&#x27;s causing them to get into my focal path and occasionally irritate the surface of my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have to curl my eyelashes because they are so long that they hit my sunglasses.  </li>
            <li> With  my long eyelashes, this curler made my eyes stand out.  </li>
            <li> I had expected this to be the ultimate eyelash curler.  </li>
            <li> They curl my lashes well, though after multiple tries and positions, I still can&#x27;t get the longest straighter lashes on the outer section of my eyelashes to curl.</li>
            <li> and I would often wait too long to replace them...</li>
            <li> What happened is, I could grasp a few lashes in the center and then the ends of the curler would grab my lids instead as it didn&#x27;t curve down/ in far enough to reach the rest of the lashes.  </li>
            <li> when I say it works, I mean that it REALLY WORKS, IT CURLS MY LASHES</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little scary at first because it&#x27;s really close to your eye when you&#x27;re doing this.</li>
            <li> The curler is extremely light which makes it seem of very poor quality</li>
            <li> It looks the same as every other curler</li>
            <li> that I hope to be using for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> This beats all the brand names by a long shot!  </li>
            <li> I am also dubious about the no pinching, as I think that is largely due to user error, not an eyelash curler itself, and I almost always pinch myself occasionally with</li>
            <li> Meaning when I curl my lashes then add mascara my lashes will be very long.</li>
            <li> so this is not a new beauty technique for me.  </li>
            <li> Although hard to adjust to a new design, other than my longtime brand, I did finally adjust and grew to like it.  </li>
            <li> I normally do not wear make up at all</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t open as wide as other curlers</li>
            <li> &amp; I don&#x27;t have to deal with the pad coming loose and falling out.</li>
            <li> Six months later, I&#x27;m requesting one because the pad has worn down and is now pinching my lashes off.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to anyone with thin and short lashes</li>
            <li> I still lose several eyelashes per day--I was hoping to lose less with this</li>
            <li> Black rubber seal on inside of handle fell out after third use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this curler for less than a month</li>
            <li> and I ended up paying about 45% less the second time.</li>
            <li> The cushions at the handle are somewhat loose because they are a little too big.</li>
            <li> I think it is because the little silicone pad is much bigger than on my previous lash curler, which is the same style I&#x27;ve used for years.</li>
            <li> It did pinch a little on my left eye</li>
            <li> have actually never used a curler before that didn&#x27;t stick to my lashes a little bit, so I was not used to one like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean, it&#x27;s not BAD, but not exceptional.  </li>
            <li> I event tried to keep holding it together as I used it until I could get another one and the jammed with my lashes IN it.</li>
            <li> Did not curl as I expected at all.  </li>
            <li> These have shown me that that is absolutely Not the case.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of a make up person</li>
            <li> so you still do have to be careful with placement.</li>
            <li> I have only had for a few weeks</li>
            <li> you still need to be careful.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different kinds and brands.</li>
            <li> With this LiveWIRE eyelash curler I have had absolutely no issues</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the scissor handle style for curlers, it often makes my hands feel like I have to contort to handle the tool properly.  </li>
            <li> (a VERY long time ago!!).</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m never certain I&#x27;m getting all my lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these almost daily for well over a month and other than a few smudges from leftover mascara</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to worry on the cushion thingy constantly falling off, which is a problem I usually have with other curlers, so</li>
            <li> I purchased a replacement from Japonesque but either the quality had deteriorated severely or (as some other Amazon reviewers suggested) perhaps the product was counterfeit.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this curler based on the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what some of the other reviewers are saying about this curler....</li>
            <li> No pulling on my eyelashes like other curlers I have used.  </li>
            <li> All the other curlers I&#x27;ve used have pulled out lashes or pinched my skin.</li>
            <li> It curls my lashes &amp;#34;evenly&amp;#34;, unlike the other types of eyelash curlers I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I had just replaced the pads in my current one and as usual</li>
            <li> There are other curlers at that price point that do the job</li>
            <li> No pinching or other damage to date.  </li>
            <li> I usually curl my lashes and then apply mascara and curl them again after different mascara applications.</li>
            <li> I noticed a lot of other curlers had refills you needed to buy and people described them as &amp;#34;less pinch&amp;#34; but  never no pinch.</li>
            <li> All of my eyelashes get curled, unlike other curlers.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> It is extremely lightweight.</li>
            <li> I tried other brands but their refills always fall off after couple of uses.</li>
            <li> hated trying to replace the pads on my old eyelash curler, I could never get them to go back in right-</li>
            <li> Other Brand curling pads wear out quickly, pinch you, make lashes do crazy things, crinkle rather than curl lashes or just pull them out pinching you in the process.</li>
            <li> so I was quite shocked how easy this was to use.</li>
            <li> I end up having to hold them at an odd angle, and it makes it harder to curl my lashes</li>
            <li> so it gets dirty rather quickly</li>
            <li> I do have to hold it closed a little longer than other curlers</li>
            <li> This curler lasts longer than conventional curlers, but it needs refills.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is that I need to extend the handles very wide to open the curler.</li>
            <li> The bad: it&#x27;s pretty similar quality to the ones that are sold in Walgreens and such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have long lashes but small eyes</li>
            <li> I opted for 1 star instead because I do think the seeded reviews are giving people a misleading average rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through 8 curlers in the past few months trying to find one that actually worked!</li>
            <li> The curlers that I&#x27;ve had before I had trouble with them slipping in my fingers and pinching to the point that it would bring tears to my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have never used one before you will need to get some practice time to master an eyelash curler down.</li>
            <li> they were very small because I couldn&#x27;t get the curler on the outside of my eye.</li>
            <li> Here is a photo of the broken curler, and the broken curler next to the new one for eye shape comparison.</li>
            <li> I noticed that it does not break my eyelashes like previous sets I have purchased.</li>
            <li> The opening where you curl your lashes is slightly narrower too</li>
            <li> so I’ve never had an issue with previous pads getting too gnarly from this.</li>
            <li> With previous curlers the rubber always separates and then the lashes look too curlers, but with this curler.</li>
            <li> I have received this product to facilitate my review, none the less all opinions are my own.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it pinches any less than my Revlon curler did (</li>
            <li> If I use it with my mascara already on it never pulls my mascara off like my previous one did.</li>
            <li> Out of the previous eyelash curlers</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t something insane, they weren&#x27;t like super high up, and it didn&#x27;t change the fact that I had no mascara on yet.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Metal feels sharper/ less comfortable than other curlers on the base of the eyelid/eyelashes</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life (and I&#x27;m no spring chicken)</li>
            <li> /&gt;The little black cushion in the finger hole pops out on one side.</li>
            <li> how tightly I squeeze.</li>
            <li> Also, if I apply too much pressure, then this curler pulls my outer lashes in an uncomfortable way - it doesn&#x27;t pull them out, but it&#x27;s still a little painful, which is why I have to be careful how much pressure I use with this item.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but the silicon part is thick</li>
            <li> It still pinched a little but probably because of the way I hold it to get my eyelashes curled the way I like.  </li>
            <li> After watching a tutorial video, I work well with this little tool.</li>
            <li> this is not your average eye lash curler!</li>
            <li> This little gem is everything that it is advertised to be.  </li>
            <li> Since this is how I have always curled my lashes, I found it a little upsetting that this curler never needs a replacement pad.</li>
            <li> I have long, thin fingers which have proven to be an issue with other eyelash curlers.</li>
            <li> I have relatively small eyes that are a bit narrow which can make for some hassle with curling, using other curlers that is.</li>
            <li> I saw in one of the questions that someone asked how wide the curling part is, it is approximately 1-1/4&amp;#34; wide.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I use it AFTER I put on my mascara and it has dried (which I would never do with a foam rubber pad).</li>
            <li> so I have tried quite a few over the years.  </li>
            <li> I received this eyelash curler a few days ago and have been using it as a prep before applying mascara.</li>
            <li> Used it a few times, but don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> is a plus but not nearly as important to me as the way this works.  </li>
            <li> I was so tired of buying eyelash curlers and finally tried this one.  </li>
            <li> I thought based on the reviews that I could use this instead of my 2 year old shu uemura curlers, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for a few weeks now.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money and buy one that has refills.</li>
            <li> It has one of those round shape rubber pads and not the square ones that curl lashes sort of funky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this eyelash curler for a few days and am hooked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this curler a few weeks</li>
            <li> I received my Professional Eyelash Curler today and used it on my eyelashes and my fake eyelashes</li>
            <li> I put it on my lashes squeezes it and hold for a few seconds and let go</li>
            <li> I have not had a lot of luck with eyelash curlers, as they tend to be too narrow and pinch my skin.</li>
            <li> read by heating it with a hair dryer for a few seconds before using it</li>
            <li> So, what is the one thing you are missing?</li>
            <li> They are a little thin and are a little flat.</li>
            <li> In the past my other eyelash curlers would pull and it would hurt!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s my eye shape, but I found them to be extremely pinchy, which is not a problem I usually have.</li>
            <li> Found this one here on Amazon after some research.&lt;br /&gt;It looks like a sturdy plain eyelash curler and it&#x27;s just what I was looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it is not easy to curl them.  </li>
            <li> The little finger holes are way too small.</li>
            <li> and I pressed down hard on it.</li>
            <li> I have long but thin eyelashes</li>
            <li> I suppose this product could work for people with shallow set eyes, but with average depth in my eyes</li>
            <li> I have very long lashes to the point where people think I&#x27;m wearing false ones, even my dad asked me the other day if I was wearing false lashes.</li>
            <li> Though it&#x27;s expensive, (for me), I immediately ordered another as a back</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I got a bum one or what.  </li>
            <li> Seems like a pointless activity.</li>
            <li> and I do not consider my eyes small by any means, but I decided to deal with it.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it is difficult to hold.  </li>
            <li> No more pinching.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I usually dont like eyelash curlers because they pinch</li>
            <li> product works well and does not pinch, or stick to your lashes like some that I  have used in the past.</li>
            <li> When I curl my eyelashes, I usually run the blow dryer in front of my lashes.  </li>
            <li> Then you apply your mascara as usual and go about</li>
            <li> I tried multiple expensive curlers, upwards of $20, and none of them worked well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not sure how I feel about the silicone strip</li>
            <li> I have had issues with past curlers getting snagged on my lashes which caused them to tug and even make  some of my lashes fall out.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, and short eye lashes.</li>
            <li> It pinches MUCH LESS!!</li>
            <li> Also, the pad is very stiff and not cushiony, so maybe that&#x27;s why?  </li>
            <li> I was using a rather hard to replace curler made in Japan...</li>
            <li> so it isn&#x27;t hard on your fingers.</li>
            <li> It pinches hard.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it a lot lately because i haven&#x27;t gone out</li>
            <li> I do wish that it would have included some instructions or at least suggestion because I just cannot get my eyelashes to curl.  </li>
            <li> Other eyelash curlers I&#x27;ve had ended up in the garbage because they would not work, difficult to hold on to and were hard on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I mean it&#x27;s just an eyelash curler,</li>
            <li> cost of these curlers is very small when you realize that you will never have to replace the pad.  </li>
            <li> It curls my impossible to curl lashes in two squeezes and they actually stay curled all day!</li>
            <li> they serious??</li>
            <li> I was tempted to go for less expensive type</li>
            <li> They are also long so they have to be curled in 2 places, at the base &amp; half way</li>
            <li> I admit that I am shocked, because this thing looks no different than the dozens of others I&#x27;ve bought over the years.</li>
            <li> On my right eye my lashes came out horrible</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are very hard to curl.  </li>
            <li> I was tired of replacing the pricey foam inserts for my eyelash curlers</li>
            <li> I bought several eyelash curlers over the years, there&#x27;s always something I hate about them.</li>
            <li> but alas it did not work.</li>
            <li> Say goodbye to glue on false lashes and step over to using these and keep eyes lashes healthier.</li>
            <li> Sounds ridiculous, but the thing has changed my life!</li>
            <li> Usually just dirty</li>
            <li> The problem is the curve on this curler is VERY shallow.  </li>
            <li> It was awkward, painful, and completely not functional.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have to use it before and after mascara to keep the curl.  </li>
            <li> Either way, unfortunately I had to find something else...</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t using my magnifying mirror and was unable to wear my glasses.</li>
            <li> But, after 3 months, it has failed.  </li>
            <li> it arrived and I tried it, I was unable to use it without pinching my eyelids.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> Curls my eyelashes without making them look weird.</li>
            <li> Over time, that gets expensive.  </li>
            <li> I recommend curling your lashes before applying mascara as doing so after will can gunk up the curler and also tug uncomfortably at your lashes.</li>
            <li> I think that I am just doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> I have very thin eyelashes, and without curling them it almost looks like nothing is there.</li>
            <li> Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> I remember how I was afraid of getting my eyelid caught but never had an issue with this one yet.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with that!</li>
            <li> Sorry to say I was somewhat disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I think it is impossible for an eyelash curler to NOT pinch.  </li>
            <li> All this time I thought I was bad with mascara, and now I&#x27;m finding out</li>
            <li> I am always getting frustrated with the fact that once I start to get used to an eyelash curler, I can never find the refills for the one I&#x27;m using.  </li>
            <li> All I know is that I would not recommend this to anyone because it is painful to use.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel you would be disappointed at all with the results.</li>
            <li> Which is crazy!</li>
            <li> I hate it when that happens.  </li>
            <li> but I hate using that.</li>
            <li> I have NEVER found an eyelash curler that curls my impossible lashes!  </li>
            <li> I had to return this curler because it pinched my eyelids so badly that I just couldn&#x27;t stand it!  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I almost hated to take it out and use it...almost!  </li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> It was awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nice eyelash curler.  My only criticism is the curler does not open any wider than most standard curlers.  I previously had a curler (which I can no longer find) that opened up extra wide, making it easy to capture all wayward eyelashes.  I do like this one does not require pad replacement, and it otherwise works well.</li>
            <li> Works great-I only had to curl my lashes once and they stayed all day! I may have over curled them the first time so just be aware of that!</li>
            <li> Works great (and doesn&#x27;t pull out my lashes)...fast delivery too!</li>
            <li> The spring back of the bumper appears to live up to it&#x27;s claims and should never need replaced. Works as it should. Worth the extra cost in the savings on replacement pads alone.</li>
            <li> In my lifetime, I&#x27;m sure that I&#x27;ve gone through hundreds of eyelash curlers. I bought into the hype on this one and purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;Much to my surprise, it really is everything they claim. Though it&#x27;s expensive, (for me), I immediately ordered another as a back up.&lt;br /&gt;It curls quickly and evenly. Doesn&#x27;t pull. No crease in the pad. Sounds ridiculous, but the thing has changed my life!</li>
            <li> It does need refills! After 2 years the rubber is cut and it cut some of my lashes off.</li>
            <li> Great curler. Works well without pinching or pulling.</li>
            <li> I have very short eyelashes and I love how this curler turns them. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The curler pinched my eyelids when I used it.  The silicone insert does fit in other curlers so I am still about to use it!</li>
            <li> This is the best eyelash curler I have ever used!  I love that you don&#x27;t have to replace the black rubber bar -- because it isn&#x27;t rubber, so it doesn&#x27;t cut itself.  Doesn&#x27;t pinch or pull the eyelashes.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried most, but this is the best eyelash curler I have ever had!  I was leery to spend $20 on this product ... I mean it&#x27;s just an eyelash curler, right? How much better could it be? Well, I&#x27;m glad I took the risk. It curls my impossible to curl lashes in two squeezes and they actually stay curled all day! I admit that I am shocked, because this thing looks no different than the dozens of others I&#x27;ve bought over the years. As for the lifetime pad, I can&#x27;t see any wear yet and I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks. I am very happy with my purchase. Oh yeah - no pinching!!</li>
            <li> Great eye lash curler.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, however, this is one awesome eyelash curler! I was using a rather hard to replace curler made in Japan... This is better and needs far less pressure to curl my straight lashes.</li>
            <li> I have very thin eyelashes, and without curling them it almost looks like nothing is there. These lash curlers worked great on my lashes and made my eyes look wonderful. They didn&#x27;t pinch, which is great. I would recommend these to anyone who is looking for a good quality eyelash curler that is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I received this as a free product for my unbiased opinion, all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> It works great. Best one I&#x27;ve ever had. Was delivered on time and everything couldn&#x27;t be happier with them!</li>
            <li> This curler worked beautifully!  I loved how it sturdy and well made it was unlike the kind sold in chain stores.  The cushion in the grips was very nice as well.  This product greatly exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I normally do not wear make up at all but in order to give my honest opinion I did for 3 days and I must say at first I didn&#x27;t think my eyelashes was even in the curler but to my pleasant surprise when I checked the mirror just to be sure , they had in fact been in it and I had a pretty good curl going on .it was an easy product to work with. I had no problems with how my fingers easily slid into the handle. It opened and closed fairly easy as well. The price is somewhat on the higher side but If need be I would buy the product again again. Because it truly works . Keep up the good job livewire!!</li>
            <li> This works amazingly well! I&#x27;ve tried many different generic brands and they never produce long-lasting curls. However, with this eyelash curler, it gives better curls AND they last throughout the day! I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Feels sturdy in the hand. Joints open and close smoothly. I use it AFTER I put on my mascara and it has dried (which I would never do with a foam rubber pad). The curl is really good, almost too much of a curl. I have hooded eyes so I don&#x27;t crimp too tightly since my lashes will touch the top of my brow and there is sometimes transference of mascara. My lashes don&#x27;t stick to the silicone pad, so there is no pulling out or clumping of lashes. What little mascara comes off on the curler wipes off easily after a quick rinse under warm water. I did NOT get this for free, but if LIVEWire Beauty wants to send me any products to try.... ;)</li>
            <li> I ordered this after reading the rave reviews.  I&#x27;ve always used an eyelash curler because I have straight eyelashes, however I am not finding it to be as great as the other reviewers.  I&#x27;ve used eyelash curlers for 30 years so I have tried quite a few over the years.  I&#x27;m not sure if I got a bum one or what.  It does not pinch but will not crimp them up.  I like the lovely lashes one better.</li>
            <li> Much better than any other eyelash curler I&#x27;ve tried.  My lashes tend to go straight out and rub against my glasses if not curled.  This is comfortable to use and I can tell that the pad will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Great eyelash curler!  Doesn&#x27;t pull, curls well, and if the claim that the rubber never needs replaced is true, well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have difficulty keeping my eyelashes curled so was excited about this product.  It does a great job in curling without clumping the eyelashes together like less expensive models do.  Unfortunately I have to use it before and after mascara to keep the curl.  It may be that my eyelashes are super straight due to past chemotherapy.</li>
            <li> Loved it! Really makes a difference on my lashes and I don&#x27;t have to worry on the cushion thingy constantly falling off, which is a problem I usually have with other curlers, so I really recommend these!</li>
            <li> Found this one here on Amazon after some research.&lt;br /&gt;It looks like a sturdy plain eyelash curler and it&#x27;s just what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;My hunt is over and I will definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Update: I&#x27;ve been using these almost daily for well over a month and other than a few smudges from leftover mascara you would have no idea they had ever been used. The pad shows no sign of use what-so-ever. This is looking like it is going to be a long lasting product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints about these eyelash curlers I thought they worked great. I have very long lashes to the point where people think I&#x27;m wearing false ones, even my dad asked me the other day if I was wearing false lashes. It sounds like a blessing but if I don&#x27;t curl them and I wear my glasses they are constantly scraping on my lenses and driving me nuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried these out today and there was no pinching at all and still the curlers were nice and tight. I was able to get my lashes curled better than my other curler and they looked longer. I did that this morning and at almost 9pm as I&#x27;m writing this they are still curled. I saw in one of the questions that someone asked how wide the curling part is, it is approximately 1-1/4&amp;#34; wide. It is true when they say that the pad goes right back to normal after using, there is no crease in it at all and I pressed down hard on it. If it is true that these don&#x27;t require replacement pads that would make me a very happy girl because every time I need replacement pads I can never find the right size and it drives me nuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have included some before and after photos. Obviously I used mascara as well but you get the point. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this complimentary product for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I have very short eyelashes. And so I can&#x27;t tell that this eyelash curler works any better and the other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> This eye lash curler feels comfortable in your finger while using it. Also the black piece where you press your lashes can be removed to clean if you curl your lashes with mascara on. The part you hold seems to go back further than other curlers. I love the very top because to helps get the curler under you eye bone to help curl your lashes. When I curled my lashes the left eye lashes were perfect. My lashes with using the curler were the same length they would have been with putting mascara on without curling my lashes. Meaning when I curl my lashes then add mascara my lashes will be very long. On my right eye my lashes came out horrible they were very small because I couldn&#x27;t get the curler on the outside of my eye. It does take some practice to get your lashes to be long with this eye lash curler. I did it for about 10 times one day and couldn&#x27;t get them right. The next day I tried about 3 times and I was about to get one eye to look good. I was able to get this eyelash curler for free to review as part of a promotion.</li>
            <li> I have never used an eyelash curler before, and having bought this one,  won&#x27;t again. It doesn&#x27;t do anything for my eyelashes... Seems like a pointless activity. Having said that, these didn&#x27;t pinch, and it&#x27;s easy to see the eyelashes appear through the curler so you know you have &#x27;got them.&#x27; They arrived quickly, and the company followed up with an email to check they arrived OK. So nothing against the seller - this review is for the pointlessness of the product...</li>
            <li> Love love love. I have very small thin eyelashes, with this and the perfect mascara, I have big beautiful plump eyelashes</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler works well</li>
            <li> This is the best eyelash curler ever! It is super easy to use. It actually curls perfectly the first go around.  My friends keep taking my curler. It doesn&#x27;t pull your lashes out. It has the rubber attachment also. That helps to make the process easy and pain free.</li>
            <li> So far so good. If you have larger eyes , as mine are almond shaped it&#x27;s great. I can finally curl my left eye with out pinching it . The curler is great</li>
            <li> I love the way this eyelash curler was packaged!  I almost hated to take it out and use it...almost!  I&#x27;m glad I did though because I love it!  It did a great job curling my lashes.  It&#x27;s funny because when I was younger I used to get complimented on my lashes (and my eyes) all of the time.  Now that I&#x27;m older...not so much.  Why is that?  I digress... This is a fabulous eyelash curler.  I think it is impossible for an eyelash curler to NOT pinch.  It still pinched a little but probably because of the way I hold it to get my eyelashes curled the way I like.  I love the fact that I will never have to replace the pads in it.  I will clean it like I always do anyway, but I don&#x27;t have to worry about the pads coming out.  I hate it when that happens.  I have to say this is one of the best I&#x27;ve tried so far and I feel like I&#x27;ve probably tried them all in the quest for the eyelashes of my youth.  I received the Professional Eyelash Curler from liveWIRE beauty to try and give my honest opinion and I just did.  :)</li>
            <li> Great product! Love it!</li>
            <li> The eyelash curler is the best curler I have owned. My eyelashes have a natural look, not bent looking. I am very pleased with it .</li>
            <li> I love the fact that you don&#x27;t have to replace the pads!  Should last a long time.</li>
            <li> After watching a tutorial video, I work well with this little tool. Good packaging and quality.</li>
            <li> Eyelash Curler of the 20&#x27;th century.  I love how this works.  Isn&#x27;t like the kind I had in the 80&#x27;s that pinched my eyelid.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great eyelash curler! Doesn&#x27;t pull my lashes and is holding up well! Wonderful buy!</li>
            <li> This is the best curler ever and the customer service by the seller was excellent too! Will never use another curler again.</li>
            <li> The pad is durable but it will need to be replaced...or in this case you will need a new curler after 5-6 months. It does curl the lashes.</li>
            <li> Excellent curler!  Easy to use and does the job.</li>
            <li> Nice curler, great customer service!</li>
            <li> I used to have a Japonesque eyelash curler that I LOVED... but eventually it broke.  I purchased a replacement from Japonesque but either the quality had deteriorated severely or (as some other Amazon reviewers suggested) perhaps the product was counterfeit.  Either way, unfortunately I had to find something else... I purchased this curler based on the other reviews.  I was disappointed.  First it does pinch eyelids.  Second it doesn&#x27;t do a better job of curling eyelids than the crappy $3 curlers you can buy at Wal*mart or similar.  This one will sit in my drawer and I am still in search of a decent eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> I have been curling my eyelashes for decades so this is not a new beauty technique for me.  The best thing about the curler is the pad - it truly feels different and curls as advertised.  However, using the curler will take some getting used to and changing your technique as if not done just so, pinching can result.  The true proof of a product is how long it will last, so if this pad really lasts for life, it will be a great product.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this curler. It&#x27;s not bad, but it does pinch. I have long enough lashes, but I have to really keep them in the curler for while before they curl. I&#x27;m still looking for something better.</li>
            <li> I was tired of replacing the pricey foam inserts for my eyelash curlers so I opted to by a more expensive &amp;#34;for life&amp;#34; curler and be done with it. The shape itself was too wide and big for my eyes and I do not consider my eyes small by any means, but I decided to deal with it. I&#x27;d have to move it several times to make sure I could angle in all the lashes. Then just last week the curler itself fell apart and is no longer usable and the available date of return has come and gone. Very frustrating. I event tried to keep holding it together as I used it until I could get another one and the jammed with my lashes IN it. Took some finagling to get it open. I found a $3.00 one at Target that actually works much better, is a better eye shape...but I will be back to replacing the foam/rubber strips. So be it. Here is a photo of the broken curler, and the broken curler next to the new one for eye shape comparison.</li>
            <li> I received this eyelash curler a few days ago and have been using it as a prep before applying mascara. The curler is extremely light which makes it seem of very poor quality so I will be following up later to see how long it lasts with daily use. It does a great job actually curling my lashes. I love that the design of the curler makes it so that the handles push the bar up to curl rather than trying to catch the lashes in between them.</li>
            <li> I love it. I got it with a high discount code. It is cute, help me when I curve my eye lash. it is easy to use. and high quality</li>
            <li> These curlers were a great purchase. I thought $14 would be too pricey but it&#x27;s way better than buying a $4 dollar one every few months considering this product doesn&#x27;t ever need refills! The pad is very soft and doesn&#x27;t tear or anything so I found it works best to curl my lashes with a lot of pressure using this curler. It doesn&#x27;t damage my lashes so I apply as much pressure as I need. I have long lashes but small eyes and I don&#x27;t think I had my lashes pinched at all! I&#x27;d say I would buy this again but I don&#x27;t think I need to! It lasts forever :)</li>
            <li> The curler does not curve enough for my eye shape, so it does pinch and pull. I could see this working well for someone who does not have deep set eyes.</li>
            <li> Great eyelash curler.  Exactly as advertised.  I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Ordered it for my wife and she is enjoying it and says it works very well and is expecting it to last a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks now. There is no pinching and it easily lengthens and separates my lashes. Very comfortable to use. I&#x27;m delighted with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is everything other people have already commented on and more... simple to use, effective, and most importantly, it DOESN&#x27;T pinch you nor does it pull your eyelashes off.  The best part of this product though, is the personalized customer attention you get when you buy it.  I&#x27;m not kidding.  Jessica B. keeps on sending you e-mails to check on you and the product just to know you are 110% satisfied with it... She also sends you tips on how to keep the product fresh and how to best use it.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with that!</li>
            <li> Meh.  I mean, it&#x27;s not BAD, but not exceptional.  It works the same as the ones in the drugstore. It DOES pinch in the inner corners, too, no matter how carefully I place it.</li>
            <li> BOGUS SELLER...pad wore out and I tried to contact seller via their website but &amp;#34;contact&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t work and there is no contact phone number!</li>
            <li> Professional Eyelash Culer by LiveWire Beauty is my FAVORITE! At my age, I have tried, bought and used many with most being a complete waste of money and hurting my eyes in the process. Many brands claim to come with LIFETIME warranties or replacements and you find out quickly why, they are not worth it and need to keep replacing. Other Brand curling pads wear out quickly, pinch you, make lashes do crazy things, crinkle rather than curl lashes or just pull them out pinching you in the process. I have tried many from cheap to the professional expensive ones. This one is by far the best I have tried. Why you may ask is this one better and why buy it? Well, let me tell you. It truly curled my eye lashes easily, making them look so long, made my eyes look wider, less tired, more youthful, less saggy, more alert, refreshed and thicker. Wow right! I know, who would have thought. Shows you what eyelash curlers were truly made to do and what a quality one like this one will do for you. Also, it is a great size for the hands and fingers. It has silicone grip pads in the finger slots for comfort. It has a wider openning and span for the lashes to enter and reaches all of my lashes not just some. With the competitor&#x27;s brand, I had to do it in sections to even get them all and it did not turn out well. The silicon pad on the curl part is wonderful. It does not crinkle your eyelashes but actually gently curls them. The curl looks really good and holds well. And let me say this again because it is so important for me, reaches and curls all lashes without pinching and pulling in one try. The handle and the ergonomic design make it comfortable to hold and use. It is professional quality, durable, nice looking, works perfect, great price, comes with a LIFETIME true warranty backing it completely and company even followed up making sure I received it, happy with it and thanked me for being a customer. This Professional Eyelash Curler by LiveWire is a great product, great customer care and warranty. These silicone curl pads are not to wear out, therefore, no need for replacing them. That is great. For, who wants to continually be replacing pads and keeping up with the replacements?! I did receive this as a sample to review and give my honest and unbiased opinion. I am so thankful for this opportunity for I finally found the perfect eye lash curler! I will be purchasing more to keep in my travel bag and to have as a backup. For, I do not want to be without this one. Your friends will love this too! These make great gift ideas for all those you love. And, we know as we get older, these are very important for our eyes to &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; and keep youthful in appearance. However, there are so many that are a waste of money. Stop wasting your money, buy this one and be amazed. You have nothing to lose with the money back guarantee and everything to gain in getting this. Say goodbye to glue on false lashes and step over to using these and keep eyes lashes healthier.</li>
            <li> Great curler. I love that you don&#x27;t have to replace the pads.</li>
            <li> This is a great gadget. I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I bought several eyelash curlers over the years, there&#x27;s always something I hate about them. This one though, I actually like, for once.&lt;br /&gt;It has padded handles so it isn&#x27;t hard on your fingers. It doesn&#x27;t need replacement parts, ever(just give it a good cleaning every now and then). It gives a nice curl without too much effort, you don&#x27;t have to sit there holding it for what seems like forever to get a decent curl. No pinching or pulling like you get with most curlers. As long as your using it properly, and not against the skin, you won&#x27;t get pinched. The Silicone cleans very easy, even with mascara on it.</li>
            <li> Great eyelash Curler... no pinching, no replacing rubber, sturdy and easy to get nicely curved lashes</li>
            <li> I love my new eyelash curler from livewire! I was offered this curler complimentary in exchange I would test it out and give you my honest opinion. I think it works great! It curls my lashes instantly and effortlessly. It&#x27;s nice because it doesn&#x27;t pinch or pull on my lashes while I&#x27;m using it. It has a really nice silicone pad that keeps it&#x27;s shape and my lashes don&#x27;t get stuck on it, so it&#x27;s painless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is comfortable, fits in hand well and is very simple to use. I use my professional eyelash curler everyday and I have gotten so many compliments on how nice my lashes look. Some times I don&#x27;t even need to wear mascara if I curl my lashes. It gives the appearance that you are wearing mascara even when your not because my lashes are perfectly curled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is my opinion that this is definitely a professional quality eyelash curler that can be used on anyone and the silicone pad makes it easy and painless to have beautiful lashes. I may have to get one of these for my daughter, because I know if I let her use mine, I will never get it back!</li>
            <li> Well...I like the fact that I&#x27;ll supposedly never have to buy replacement inserts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to work ok.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I can&#x27;t get my lashes to curl nicely with it. It does the thing where the outer lashes curl more than the middle ones.&lt;br /&gt;It catches my skin on occasion, but I&#x27;ve never had a curler that didn&#x27;t. I imagine that&#x27;s more to do with different eye shapes being compatible with different curlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since opening it, there has been a strange smell...like...maybe a road tar mixed with plastic kind of smell? I figured that would dissipate but it&#x27;s been several weeks and still smells every time I use it. It&#x27;s kind of gross and chemically, but not a deal breaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little black cushion in the finger hole pops out on one side. I put it back, but it&#x27;s not like, glued in or anything so it just pops out again. Not like it couldn&#x27;t be used without the cushions, but it&#x27;s nicer feeling with the cushion in.</li>
            <li> This is by far the gentlest curler I have used. Produces a nice curl. I press and hold for 5 seconds, and repeat again for each eye.</li>
            <li> Shortly after I purchased this curler, I received an email from the company asking me to leave a review. At first I thought, &amp;#34;Are they serious?? It&#x27;s a freaking eyelash curler, give me a break.&amp;#34;  Then I actually USED it....WOW!!!  This really IS the best eyelash curler I have EVER used!! I have very short, straight eyelashes and it is not easy to curl them.  This curler curls my lashes with no problem at all, and they stay curled for days!!  I left my eye makeup on for three days in a row (I know, gross), just to test it out, and my lashes stayed curled the whole time! I will never buy another eyelash curler again! This is the one for me!</li>
            <li> My first experience with using this curler is very positive and the price was right.  Only time will tell if it performs as promised over the long term.</li>
            <li> The little finger holes are way too small.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Bought for my wife and she uses it every day.</li>
            <li> Love it! The best one I have found</li>
            <li> Years ago a person was able to purchase an eyelash curler and then later refill rubbers when the old ones wore out.........apparently in this &amp;#34;throwaway world&amp;#34; that is not the case anymore.  So imagine my surprise and delight when I came across this eyelash curler.........I LOVE IT!!!! Thankyou for selling a product that I plan on using for years to come.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what some of the other reviewers are saying about this curler....this is not your average eye lash curler! You know instantly the first time you use it, it feels different, it curls perfectly, it&#x27;s made well &amp; best of all....you don&#x27;t have to ever run out &amp; buy the rubber cushion replacements ever again! I will definitely recommend this curler to friends &amp; family!</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to do.  I haven&#x27;t used a eyelash curler in a while since I just didn&#x27;t have one but it does make a difference.  It is easy to use and easier to clean as well.  I remember how I was afraid of getting my eyelid caught but never had an issue with this one yet.  I am glad I got this product and satisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:  This product was bought for free for the purpose of a product review.  This is also an unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s my eye shape, but I found them to be extremely pinchy, which is not a problem I usually have.</li>
            <li> Great product and seller.</li>
            <li> I do like this eye-curler, I would buy again. First and foremost this thing is not a magical eye curler it&#x27;s a good eyelash curler it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I do on occasions accidentally pinch and pull my eyelids and eyelashes with this eyelash curler, it&#x27;s bound to happen. Durability so far so good.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t curl any better than my regular curler, but it&#x27;s nice to never have to buy a refill.</li>
            <li> Used it a few times, but don&#x27;t like it. Didn&#x27;t give me any more curl that using a mascara wand and it clumped my eyelashes together. Horrible.</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler works great.  No pulling on my eyelashes like other curlers I have used.  I appreciate that I will not have to be replacing the pad.</li>
            <li> I know what you&#x27;re thinking. Same as me. What makes this eye lash curler so special? I have no idea. All I know is I&#x27;ve been using eyelash curlers for nearly 15 years and nothing compares to this one. It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this works, but I wish I found it years ago, I would have saved so much time curling and recurling my straight beyond straight and stubborn eye lashes.  I can guarantee that I have tried every eyelash curler on the market, from drugstore brands to the priciest of them all . . . not one of them did the trick like this one does.  For the first time in my life (and I&#x27;m no spring chicken) my eyelashes stay curled for the entire day!!!&lt;br /&gt;The fact that it doesn&#x27;t require pad changing is a plus but not nearly as important to me as the way this works.  Only because of my professional background and the research I have to do for my clients, I would love to know how and why this is different.  It looks the same as every other curler BUT it works, and when I say it works, I mean that it REALLY WORKS, IT CURLS MY LASHES AND THEY STAY CURLED ! ! !  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS PRODUCT !</li>
            <li> I could not wait to try this Professional Eyelash Curler from liveWIRE that doesn&#x27;t pinch or pull. I was not blessed with long gorgeous lashes, but with this handy curler I had noticeable longer eyelashes on the first try using just regular mascara. No fiber lash mascara was needed. They looked so nice. I finally found the gentle trick to my new longer eyelashes! As a state licensed Cosmetologist I have tried everything to achieve my desired long lashes, but no luck. Other eyelash curlers I&#x27;ve had ended up in the garbage because they would not work, difficult to hold on to and were hard on my eyelashes. My lashes did not need that kind of punishment. I love the no-slip padded grip handles, the nicely padded curler pad that never needs replacing and is gentle on your lashes. The curler even comes with a lifetime Guarantee! This curler is very well made for the money and is a must have for your makeup bag. This is my honest opinion after trying this product</li>
            <li> This works great! All the other curlers I&#x27;ve used have pulled out lashes or pinched my skin. This one works just like they say! The follow up with this product is also great. The customer service alone is reason enough to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I had just broken my eyelash curlers, so when I was selected to review these, I was really excited. The packaging is really cute and girly, which of course makes them a great gift. I&#x27;ve gone through a lot of eyelash curlers and these are my new favorite. As someone with autoimmune arthritis at a young age, it can be difficult to curl my eyelashes, but the rubber inside the handles is amazing! It makes them so much easier to hold on to and use and they don&#x27;t slip. So far I haven&#x27;t almost poked my eyes out dropping them, and that to me is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eyelash curlers seem like a no thought product but these really are great, and I know they will last me a long time!</li>
            <li> This is a sturdy product.  Looks nice and seems to work well for the money.  The only thing is that it is difficult to hold.  The narrow scissor type handle makes it hard to fit my fingers in and I don&#x27;t even have big fingers.  I can&#x27;t imagine trying to use these if I had bigger sized fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Best eyelash curler I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use. Loving it so far!</li>
            <li> Did not curl as I expected at all.  I couldn&#x27;t tell from the picture if it was going to have two rubber wires.  Mine had one and was off the curler.</li>
            <li> I brought a eyelash curler 40+ years ago. Have never found one I have like as much. Until possibly this one. I never could find a replacement that would curl my lashes for more than a hour. So far with the Livewire Eyelash curler, my eyelash looked good at the end of the day. The Livewire eyelash curler says it doesn&#x27;t need replacement pads because it uses a hyper elastic silicon pad that will bounce back to life. Imagine a eyelash curler that doesn&#x27;t pinch and needs no replacement pads. I use alcohol to keep them clean and germ free. I believe I have found one that I will compare to my favorite one of years ago. I received the eyelash curler at a reduce rate for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Wounderful eyelash curler. It does a great job! The company contacted me twice to make sure I was satisfied.  Impressed with the product and the customer service.</li>
            <li> Best eyelash curler I have ever used. Well worth the investment. Love it!</li>
            <li> Love my eyelash curler! Comfortable and does a perfect job. Thank you! Great job!</li>
            <li> great product for the money</li>
            <li> I think the curler never needs replacing b/c u can&#x27;t use it. I tried several times and all times it hurt. went back to my old reliable Revlon curler.</li>
            <li> This is a really good curler. Which is why I was excited to get a chance to review it. This curler let&#x27;s me get right up to the root of my lash without pinching. It creates a curl that lasts all day long. I really like the rubber grips on the handles because it makes this curler comfortable to grip. It comes packaged in a cute box perfect for wrapping and gifting. Opinions are 100% my own and have not been influenced in any way.</li>
            <li> This is a really great eyelash curler. It opens and closes very smoothly, feels great and my hand and is actually comfortable on my eyelashes! I could tell immediately that this curler is made very well. The little cushion is a lot nicer than most curlers I&#x27;ve used. It doesn&#x27;t get flat or  any dents in it after you use it. It has a lifetime warranty which is great because you can get it replaced if anything ever happens to it. I highly doubt I will ever need to use that warranty. EVen the cousin itself is meant to last forever so you won&#x27;t ever need to replace it. It really is a very nice eyelash curler!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product received for testing and review. All thoughts and opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Best curler EVER!!! Love it.</li>
            <li> Best eyelash curler I have found. No pinching, no cutting (!) and perfect lashes every time.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I have used an eyelash curler ever since I was in high school! (a VERY long time ago!!). This one is the best ever.</li>
            <li> Really nice curl, and no, it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> Feels sturdy and comfortable to hold. So far very happy with my new curler, it doesn&#x27;t pinch or crease my lashes. Would buy again!</li>
            <li> I received this produc for free to do the review. I&#x27;m obsessed with mascara and eyelash curlers and have tried many in the past good and bad. These are good light weight but not cheap.</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler works really great. I always have issues with pinching while trying to curl my lashes. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s that I hold them incorrectly or just because I buy cheap ones from the dollar store because I assume they are all the same. These have shown me that that is absolutely Not the case. The silicone padding is softer and gives a good shape to the curl and there is even silicone padding in the handles for comfort while using them. I curled from root to tip holding for about 5 seconds at each interval and my lashes got a great natural looking curl from them.The fact that you don&#x27;t have to worry about replacing the pads is a huge bonus! That&#x27;s the only reason I would buy the cheap ones really, it was just as simple to buy a brand new pair than trying to get new refills. The packaging is professional and cute and would make these a really nice gift. I&#x27;m very impressed with how well and pain free these work. I would definitely recommend this to others. I happened to receive mine free as a promotion for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience and opinions using this curler.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Does the job&lt;br /&gt;No signs of wear or tear&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable in my hand&lt;br /&gt;Promise of never needing refills&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t open as wide as other curlers&lt;br /&gt;Metal feels sharper/ less comfortable than other curlers on the base of the eyelid/eyelashes&lt;br /&gt;Open-close mechanism not as smooth as other curlers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this a good curler simply for doing a good job of curling my lashes and not ever requiring refills. It&#x27;s double the price of a decent curler (my Tweezerman one was about $7-8) which is a great deal considering you&#x27;ll never have to get refills.</li>
            <li> This is a great eyelash curler, i had to curl them twice which is no biggie. It did pinch me more than my regular eyelash curlers but if u position it the right way you won&#x27;t get pinched.</li>
            <li> The LiveWire curler is great. It works good for my short eyelashes. I also like that it is easy to use. I plan to order more soon.</li>
            <li> I actually really love this eyelash curler because it makes my eyelashes look really long. Sometimes it does pinch but if you readjust it, it won&#x27;t pinch anymore. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great curler, would buy again. It also is a great gift idea.</li>
            <li> Working great so far!</li>
            <li> I hope it&#x27;s true that I will never need refills. But so far it works fine. The main reason I bought this product is because it claimed to never needing refills, so I hope that I won&#x27;t need refills. Time will tell.</li>
            <li> No more pinching. These work very well!</li>
            <li> Where have you been all my life? I been on the search for the perfect eyelash curler that won&#x27;t pinch, shaped for Asian eyes, and does not need replacement pads.With my whimpy Asian eyelashes, this has been the only eyelash curler that can actually grab them at the base and produce a nice curler without pinching.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of a make up person so I was quite shocked how easy this was to use. The handles are very comfortable and it&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
            <li> This seems no different then what you would find at a drugstore with the exception of the silicone piece being firmer and it&#x27;s glued to the curler. I used it on bare lashes and it didn&#x27;t really curl. Maybe you need to do it with mascara but I hate using that. It also pinched. My eyes are roundish so it might work better if you have wider, more almond shaped eyes. Also the product packaging was opened when it arrived so I don&#x27;t think it was in new condition. Still looking...</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the liveWIRE eyelash curler.  It curls my lashes &amp;#34;evenly&amp;#34;, unlike the other types of eyelash curlers I have tried.  I am glad I purchased this one for sure.  And equally happy that it will last a lot longer than the others.  Thank you for this product.</li>
            <li> I was so tired of buying eyelash curlers and finally tried this one.  I love it.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li> Pretty cool! Eyelashes stay curled :)</li>
            <li> Completely love this eyelash curler</li>
            <li> Curled lashes only last for about an hour. Very disappointed. I thought based on the reviews that I could use this instead of my 2 year old shu uemura curlers, but I was wrong. Going back to order the latter since those kept my lashes curled all day without any mascara.</li>
            <li> This curler is very nice except it&#x27;s not curved enough for my eyes so i returned it. I wish it was curved more because it&#x27;s very nicely made and i would love to not have to replace the cushion. Oh well</li>
            <li> This curler worked great on my short , straight lashes.  I had stopped using other ones so much because they were pulling out my lashes and pinching my eyelids,  but this one did none of that.  It allowed me to get a nice curved lash and didn&#x27;t pinch at all.  YAY.  It fits comfortably in my hand and gives me the control I need to get the inner lashes ,  as well as the outer,  at the same time.  I really like the pad too.  It has more give and bounce to it,  than the others I have purchased.  Really happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;I received this eyelash curler free for the purpose of testing and review.  All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Curler is sturdy. Have been using it for a few weeks now.  It does not pinch my eyes (almond-shaped), although I&#x27;m sure it could if I just wasn&#x27;t lined up properly. Looking forward to not having to change the pad or having a cut gouged into it over time, which pulls out my lashes. If the pad does ever wear out (although I really I don&#x27;t see how it couldn&#x27;t after a long time of use), you can contact the company for a replacement. I still lose several eyelashes per day--I was hoping to lose less with this but I think it&#x27;s just normal loss for me. Nice customer service.</li>
            <li> great product , recommended</li>
            <li> Wonderful curler! Best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> The cushions at the handle are somewhat loose because they are a little too big. The curling action of this product is just okay. My lashes don&#x27;t get a great or long-lasting curl. The curl itself lasts for about one day. Also, if I apply too much pressure, then this curler pulls my outer lashes in an uncomfortable way - it doesn&#x27;t pull them out, but it&#x27;s still a little painful, which is why I have to be careful how much pressure I use with this item. I used to have a Revlon curler that worked much better.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Love this eyelash curler! I have short eyelashes that need to be curled or you can&#x27;t see them even with mascara and I have tried so many eyelash curlers and they were ok but this one beats them all!! My eyelashes hold a curl all day and that has not happened with others I have used. So I would recommend this one to everyone!</li>
            <li> Pinches, pulls, and does not &amp;#34;spring back&amp;#34; as stated in description. Don&#x27;t waste your money and buy one that has refills.</li>
            <li> Love it! Works perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is the first eyelash curler I&#x27;ve ever tried and I was pleasantly surprised. As promised, my eyelids didn&#x27;t get pinched and the process was pretty easy. I also felt pretty safe using it, because I was worried it would damage my lashes or pull them out, but I don’t think it’s going to happen with this product. The pad didn&#x27;t stick to my eyelashes and it did give me a nice curl. This curler is easy to operate and doesn&#x27;t require any replacement pads, so that’s a big plus. I received a sample of this product for testing and reviewing purposes and I think this is a great addition to my make-up collection and I’ll keep on using it.</li>
            <li> I received this complimentary product from the seller in order to review it for their company. The packaging was adorable, though it was a bit squished when it arrived. I love eyelash curlers, and was skeptical trying a new one. However I was pleasantly surprised by this product. It works great!! I love it! Even my husband said my lashes looked great!!</li>
            <li> I have been attempting to curl my lashes since I was a teen (In my 30&#x27;s now). I have very thin, and short eye lashes. Ive tried so  many techniques and wear down the little smooshy foam inside. I Love that this curler because the little insert springs right back into place. I was able to curl my eye lashes without any pain or ripping of my lil hairs and best of all it lasted my whole 10 hour shift with just a little mascara. I would highly recommend it to anyone with thin and short lashes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own</li>
            <li> This is my first time using and Eyelash Curler and it wasn&#x27;t hard at all to work. I wear eyelash extensions and I never get them curled after they&#x27;re applied for some reason or another. I just got my lashes applied yesterday and decided today to try out my new livewire Eyelash Curler and I love how it makes my lashes look, it gave them an additional pop. My eyes look wider. I found this curler very easy to use and I didn&#x27;t feel any pinching either. It really felt comfortably holding between my fingers. This is a great product and I don&#x27;t feel you would be disappointed at all with the results.</li>
            <li> i am in my 69th year.  i have been using an eyelash curler since I was 16 years old, some &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; quality; this is by far the BEST curler I have ever experienced, in my life!!!  It is everything it is described and MORE!!!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product! Easy to use and great results. It goes everywhere with me!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Would def recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It does not pull lashes out.</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler is probably the best one I have ever owned. It came and I promptly opened it up. I noticed that it does not break my eyelashes like previous sets I have purchased. Thank you for making this amazing product!!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to wear mascara as it bothers my sensitive eyes so this curler is an easy way to make my eyelashes look pretty!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product. I was planning on purchasing another eyelash curler but decided on this one since it seemed to get good reviews. BIG mistake. This feels incredibly cheap and actually curls WORSE than the one I got at the dollar store. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> This is a lovely product.  It makes a eyelashes look naturally curled.  Doesn&#x27;t make them look crimped. The company followup is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;For a small company, the customer service is as good as Zappos or Apple, perhaps even better.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Works great, doesn&#x27;t stick to lashes</li>
            <li> Love it. Very easy to use, and it curls my eyelashes quickly!</li>
            <li> These are definitely more comfortable to use and pinch 95% less than my old pair. I did manage to get skin once - perhaps it was my fault - I wasn&#x27;t using my magnifying mirror and was unable to wear my glasses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been 2 weeks but so far so good! Great customer service for this brand. Fast shipping/delivery.</li>
            <li> I have tried many curlers over the years, and this is the first one I&#x27;ve found that actually WORKS!!!  I am a senior and lashes are more of a challenge than ever, but with this Pro curler mine are now like beautiful fans!</li>
            <li> Curls, but definitely pulls lashes.</li>
            <li> I love my new lash curler!!!!!!  It&#x27;s been years since I&#x27;ve used a lash curler, and I forgot how great they are.  This one from livewire is terrific, no replacement pads needed!  That&#x27;s huge for me.  I think that&#x27;s the reason I stopped using a lash curler before, I had to replace the pad and just never did it.  (I&#x27;m kinda bad about that kind of thing)  It&#x27;s perfect for me that there is no replacement necessary, I can use this forever now!  Thanks!  Also it&#x27;s very comfortable to use.  The padded finger holes are a nice touch, a little added luxury.  I&#x27;ve used this every time I&#x27;ve applied makeup in the last couple weeks and I am so happy I purchased this.  I don&#x27;t have very thick or long lashes and curling them makes them more noticeable, and opens my eyes up.  Very happy with my new lash curler.</li>
            <li> My favorite eyelash curler by far! It does not pinch or pull on your eyelids, nor does the pad tear and rip! Definitely want to order again so I have multiples to keep in my bathroom, purse, travel bag etc. Recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> Got the product promptly, even received 2 emails from the seller offering any support I might need, which was nice. The curler does not pinch or pull, but I don&#x27;t think it curls lashes any better than the cheaper ones sold at drugstores. My biggest complaint is that I need to extend the handles very wide to open the curler. When I measured the extension, it was 4&amp;#34; from the outermost part of the handles (where your fingers go through), whereas my old Revlon curler measures 3.5&amp;#34;. As you can see in the picture, the handles of the LiveWire curler (left) form almost a 90 degree angle, but the front handle of the Revlon curler (right) is bent to create more like a 60 degree angle. Given that I have fairly small hands, it takes more effort to open up the curler and it just doesn&#x27;t feel comfortable. The opening where you curl your lashes is slightly narrower too so I&#x27;m never certain I&#x27;m getting all my lashes. I love the idea of never replacing the pads but I think I&#x27;ll be returning this curler.</li>
            <li> love it..I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and in all my life using a eyelash curler have NEVER found one better. Curls real good , doe not pinch and never need to replace the rubber. I love it, if you curl your lashes you must have one of these, the best.  Your&#x27;ll never buy another!!</li>
            <li> Although hard to adjust to a new design, other than my longtime brand, I did finally adjust and grew to like it.  But, after 3 months, it has failed.  The silicone strip has split, and is pinching and pulling out eyelashes.  The split was actually full of pulled eyelashes.  I guess it&#x27;s back to my old brand.</li>
            <li> I very much love this eyelash curler.  Its perfect!</li>
            <li> I really loved this eyelash curler, but it didn&#x27;t really stand the test of time. After just a few months it developed a line in the pad, so my lashes started sticking in it and falling out. I didn&#x27;t use too much pressure to curl my lashes (just enough for it to create a curl), yet the line formed anyway. Also, both pads on the handle started falling off, so eventually I ended up loosing them. I ordered another one because I really liked it at the beginning, so I&#x27;m hoping that it&#x27;ll work out this time around...</li>
            <li> I would use this before putting mascara on. And it makes my eye lashes look curled more. I would also do it after putting on my eye make up just to make them look good.</li>
            <li> Their customer service is great. I received a follow up email asking how I like the product. Proactive customer service is a rarity that I appreciate. Unfortunately, I do not like the curler and will be going back to my usual. The rubber liners on the inside of the handle wiggle off while I used it. The curler, itself, did nothing to my lashes. I was excited about all the positive reviews here... maybe it&#x27;s just my lashes? I&#x27;ve been using Shu Uemura &amp; Bobbi Brown for years. I thought I could save money so I tried this one out. Bobbi &amp; Shu, here I come!</li>
            <li> This is a smooth beauty implement.  No pinching. I now heat the unit in hot water - wipe it dry - then curl.  Very nice and the quality of rubber will never wear out.</li>
            <li> Works great. I wish the name was somewhere on the curler so when I need another one I will remember it</li>
            <li> it is ok, I had a mac eyelash curler for years and thought this was going to be as good….not!</li>
            <li> I am always getting frustrated with the fact that once I start to get used to an eyelash curler, I can never find the refills for the one I&#x27;m using.  Over the years I&#x27;ve thrown out countless curlers because I could no longer find the replacement pads anywhere in the store or online.  And if I could the refills they would be more expesive than a new curler.  This has so far alevated my dislike of that process.  While it took a bit of getting used to the pad, now I love this curler.  The fact it doesn&#x27;t need refills is great.  It remains to be seen if the pad will continue to bounce back after a very long period of daily use, but so far I am hopeful that this curler will do what they say and never need replacing.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are fairly long but refuse to curl. This curler has worked better than all others I have tried, but it is still not what I would consider a genuine curl, more of a very slight flare. If your eyelashes are able to curl at all, I would imagine that this would be a perfect tool.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Just....love it!</li>
            <li> Was for my daughter she like it, it seemed to have given her a curl in her lashes</li>
            <li> I like trying new beauty products and since this was so well reviewed I thought I&#x27;d give it a go. Its advertised as a no pinch curler but upon trying it, it pinched me several times! I tried maneuvering the curler different ways to make it not pinch but alas it did not work. Perhaps it has to do with my eye shape? Nonetheless, I already threw away the packaging or I probably would have returned it. Two stars&lt;br /&gt;were given because it did provide a good curl and its construction appears sturdy.</li>
            <li> I am going to be 50 years old this year and have been curling my lashes since I&#x27;m 14.  Over the past year I have bought several different curlers because I&#x27;m noticing at nearly 50 my finest asset my lashes are thinning.  I  am soooo thankful for livewire.  The makeup artist at my daughters recent wedding used it on me and recommended it.  Love Amazon and your curler.  My finest assets are back.  The curler grabs and doesn&#x27;t pinch. Thank you. GA</li>
            <li> Iv&#x27;e been using it and it&#x27;s the best eyelash curler I have ever used! I would recomand it to anyone! T!hankyou for a quick delivery</li>
            <li> No complaints whatsoever with this eyelash curler. I have replaced the one I got from both Tarte and Revlon since getting this one and it seems to work pretty well with my asian eyelashes. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Black rubber seal on inside of handle fell out after third use.</li>
            <li> I love the fact you don&#x27;t need to replace the pads! In the past my other eyelash curlers would pull and it would hurt! After curling my eyelashes I don&#x27;t even need mascara. It&#x27;s a great product. I would definitely buy this for gifts for the woman in my family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product for free to review for an unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Excellent - night and day compared to my cheap Sally H. one -- they might look the same but this one is VERY comfortable and never pinches my eyelid.  It deserves to be the #1 seller!  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This curler did not work for me at all.  The promise of no pinching was simply not met.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I&#x27;ll explain why I was looking for a new curler.  I&#x27;ve had the same Revlon curler for probably 20 years and have loved it.  Only recently, I ran out of the old refill pads for it and can only find the new silicone ones.  They just weren&#x27;t staying in place and popped out at the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea of not needing refill pads is what brought me to this curler.  I almost didn&#x27;t buy it because it looked like most reviews were written in exchange for a free curler.  I thought this might be giving it a distorted and not accurate high rating.  Giving the company the benefit of the doubt, I tried it anyway.  Needless to say, my review is true and honest and not driven by receiving the product for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it arrived and I tried it, I was unable to use it without pinching my eyelids.  The problem is the curve on this curler is VERY shallow.  I attached pictures of it next to my old Revlon curler to illustrate the difference.  I suppose this product could work for people with shallow set eyes, but with average depth in my eyes I just couldn&#x27;t grab the lashes.  What happened is, I could grasp a few lashes in the center and then the ends of the curler would grab my lids instead as it didn&#x27;t curve down/ in far enough to reach the rest of the lashes.  It was awkward, painful, and completely not functional.  Because it didn&#x27;t meet the &amp;#34;no pinching&amp;#34; promise, I returned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, the company refunded my money and was all around pleasant in my experience with them.  For that reason, I might have given this 2 stars.  I opted for 1 star instead because I do think the seeded reviews are giving people a misleading average rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end I went back to my old Revlon curler and bent the metal a little bit with some needle nose pliers to hold the silicone refill in place.  It worked like a charm. :)</li>
            <li> I was in the market for a new eyelash curler and came across the liveWIRE beauty model.  I read the description and was most attracted to the &amp;#34;never needs refill pads&amp;#34; which was exactly the reason I was shopping for a new curler.  I had just replaced the pads in my current one and as usual the new pad kept coming out, wouldn&#x27;t fit quite right, etc.  Then I see a further claim that the liveWIRE version doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;pinch or pull&amp;#34;.  I noticed the high reviews and proceeded to read several that supported the claims so I decided why not - I needed a new one anyway.  Well simply stated - I LOVE IT!!!  I&#x27;m not a makeup professional by any means but I do use a fair amount of makeup every day and curling my eyelashes was one of my least favorite parts.  This little gem is everything that it is advertised to be.  The no pinch claim is true but you have to know how to use the curler properly. You truly do not even know your eyelashes are in the curler.  Another person&#x27;s review remarked that use and success could depend on your eye shape and I couldn&#x27;t agree more.  I love the silicon pad - so much better than other brands that cut and fall apart after a short period of time.  Do not hesitate to try this curler - truly fabulous and I am so glad I took the time to research and settle on this one...  Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a really good eyelash curler for a long time. The problem with them for me is that the cushion wears out and then I have to find them. Then the replacements won&#x27;t stay IN the curler. Then the curler eventually gets out of alignment and I have to find a new one. So far this one has worked really well. It will accommodate a lot of different eye sizes. It gets all my lashes and they seem to stay curled longer. I will hold the company accountable for their claims that the cushion will not wear out. I hope to have this one for a long, long time as I can&#x27;t afford much anymore and this was actually a &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; purchase for me.</li>
            <li> Pinched my eyelids and it really hurts!  Just tried once and that was enough for me.</li>
            <li> Was told that I would never need a replacement pad by rep. Six months later, I&#x27;m requesting one because the pad has worn down and is now pinching my lashes off. I haven&#x27;t heard back from rep and it looks like their website is defunct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I received a response from the rep and they offered to refund my entire purchase on top of sending replacement pads. I appreciate the customer service, but can&#x27;t give the product 5 stars since it didn&#x27;t live up to its claim of never needing a replacement pad - which is the only reason I purchased the product.</li>
            <li> Love it. It is much easier to use than other eye lash curlers I have had.  It pinches MUCH LESS!!</li>
            <li> Curler works well. Even nicer is the email and tips the seller gives on how to use the curler for best results. Also, seller gives other beauty tips which was nice. Feels good to support a little company</li>
            <li> Love this new find! Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t pinch or pull out eyelashes, keeps them curled all day...win-win!</li>
            <li> I receive this product well packaged and its amazing I love how it curls my lashes in no time, and with my mascara I don&#x27;t need to continue to curl them thru out the day.&lt;br /&gt;I receive this product on a discount or free for reviewing purposes</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pinch like most eyelash curlers. I was impressed with how well it curled my lashes.</li>
            <li> It pinches/pull my lashes in a strange way everytime. I think it is because the little silicone pad is much bigger than on my previous lash curler, which is the same style I&#x27;ve used for years. I&#x27;m hoping I will eventually get used to it because when I eventually do get my lashes positioned correctly it does a great job.</li>
            <li> Works perfect and love the cushioned handle.</li>
            <li> the best eyelash curler i&#x27;ve ever used. such a smooth movement. curled really nice and left my lashes curled for a long time. defiantly the best one i&#x27;ve ever had. this is an a+++ in my book. highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to add to my review by posting some pictures and adding I also liked the finger holes having a rubber like lining it makes it softer on the fingers to use. This is the best eyelash curler I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve honestly never had much luck with eyelash curlers.  I&#x27;ve had several over the years, and I just never noticed a difference when using them.  I&#x27;ve tried doing them before mascara, after mascara (which I do NOT recommend- youch!), warmed with a blow-dryer, holding for 5 seconds-8 seconds- 15 seconds....  I never noticed a curl to them.  So I honestly didn&#x27;t think that this would be any different, but I decided to give it a try.  First time I used it, I took a &#x27;before&#x27; picture (included).  I pressed the curler and held for 8 seconds.  Then released and took an &#x27;after&#x27; picture (included).  There was an actual curl to my lashes.  It wasn&#x27;t something insane, they weren&#x27;t like super high up, and it didn&#x27;t change the fact that I had no mascara on yet.  But you can see in the pictures that there&#x27;s a definite difference.  I&#x27;d recommend this eyelash curler to anyone, especially those who have hard-to-curl-lashes!</li>
            <li> Really like this eyelash curler. I don&#x27;t like curlers that digs into any place on the skin around the eyes. Most curlers press in at some point around my eyes due to the design (or maybe it&#x27;s the &#x27;design&#x27; of MY eyes!), especially on the outer sides lower area. These do not dig. It does a very good job of curling my lashes. I really appreciate that I don&#x27;t have to replace the rubber pad. It has one of those round shape rubber pads and not the square ones that curl lashes sort of funky. I&#x27;ve only been using this curler for less than a month but I use it almost every day and so far I&#x27;m happy with the results. If you don&#x27;t need it immediately, I recommend you put it your cart and wait for the price to drop below $15. The first one I ordered I paid almost $20 and then I wanted a second for set and I ended up paying about 45% less the second time. The price on this item constantly changes. My sister purchased it for about $15. It&#x27;s well made. I only have 4 others to compare it too and can honestly say is a pretty nice curler. I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great curler, excellent customer service!</li>
            <li> Works great &amp; I don&#x27;t have to deal with the pad coming loose and falling out.</li>
            <li> This curler works well. I like the fact that I won&#x27;t have to replace the pad.&lt;br /&gt;The service was fast and accurate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this eyelash curler for a few days and am hooked. I have long, thin fingers which have proven to be an issue with other eyelash curlers. Not livewire&#x27;s. The body of the curler is a little longer than others that I own. Aside, from my fingers feeling great in the finger holes, the longer body also falls below my cheeks. Genius! I&#x27;m able to curl my lashes without having to contort my hands and fingers to get a &amp;#34;good angle&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curl of the lash was great. No kinks, pulling, snagging of the lashes, nor smearing of the makeup that had already been applied. If eye shadow got on the curler, it was super easy to wipe right off. I love that the pad is not a foamy material so it doesn&#x27;t collect makeup. I used a little warm water and soap to clean it and it held up great. Oftentimes with the foamy pads you need to wait for it to dry before the next use. Love that I don&#x27;t need to replace the pad either.&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is well made, durable, easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> PROS:The LiveWire Eyelash comes in super cute packaging and does a nice job of curling my lashes. I like that it doesn&#x27;t pinch my lashes, yet it curls them nicely. I believe the key to the pinch-free experience is the strip of rubber where it squeezes your lashes. I like that this rubber piece is removable for cleaning purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: The only thing that I do not like about this curler is that it doesn&#x27;t open and close smoothly. It is more difficult to open and close than other curlers I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  Overall, nothing about this curler stands out enough to justify the price. Honestly, you could pick up a curler of similar quality at the drugstore for half the price. For the $15 price tag, I would have to say pass. There are other curlers at that price point that do the job better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for sharing my honest opinion of the product. Opinion is entirely my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;__________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/22/2015 UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After posting my previous review LiveWire was kind enough to send me out a new curler. It seems that the first curler I received had been defective, and wasn&#x27;t closing correctly.  They sent out a replacement quickly and this one works PERFECTLY! I wanted to pop in and update my review, as I now think that this curler is fantastic.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this curler and the awesome customer service LiveWire has provided. I would recommend this curler to anyone looking for a curler that does a great job curling your lashes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought really expensive eyelash curlers and could now kick myself for paying for a name and not getting a great product like this one. I&#x27;m REALLY impressed with this curler, you don&#x27;t even have to even squeeze too hard to get a nice curl! Very very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I received this liveWIRE professional grade eyelash curler for free* to try and review, and I was really hoping that they would have something special to them that would make them stand out from other pairs that I have tried. They really don’t, but I am still giving them 4 stars because they work. The metal to them is a bit thicker and sturdier than the name brand pair that I have owned for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do have a decent pad to them that has seem to be springing back no matter how tightly I squeeze. You can see the mark that the upper metal bar leaves when pressed down on them, but it quickly goes away when left opened. I suppose this is good so that you don’t have to replace the pad, but I usually store mine open so I’ve never had an issue with previous pads getting too gnarly from this. Usually just dirty and I regularly clean them with a q-tip and some eye makeup remover, then a quick rinse and a thorough drying so metal doesn’t rust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for curling my eye lashes they clamp without pinching and curl just as well as any others I have tried. They have circles for your fingers that are similar to most other eye lash curlers you see out there, and I don’t see anything about them that makes them more ergonomic than any other pair on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*regardless of getting this eyelash curler for free this is my 100% honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Love this eyelash curler. They are right when they say it does not pinch. Others I have used certainly do. Like the fact that the pad part doesn&#x27;t need replacing! Would definitely buy this again and tell anyone who is interested about it.</li>
            <li> Great product! no pinching or pulling.</li>
            <li> I try not to use much eye makeup......dont want wrinkles. But for my flat lashes, a curler is a must. When I got a chance to get this on a promotion I was so excited to give it a try!  It is perfect for not pulling my lashes out, just a simple curl and Im done.</li>
            <li> I love it! I usually dont like eyelash curlers because they pinch but this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This product did not  my eyelid hurt to curl lashes. Not a described.</li>
            <li> Seems like a good curler, time will tell. I like that it doesn&#x27;t require cushions.</li>
            <li> I love this eyelash curler! It curls just the right amount. With previous curlers the rubber always separates and then the lashes look too curlers, but with this curler.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyelash curler I&#x27;ve ever used.  No pinching!  No stuck lashes!  It curls better than all others and without any pain or pulling on your lashes or the surrounding area.  I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler feels nice with the silicone pad but I do feel it is overpriced compared to similar. It did pinch a little on my left eye so you still do have to be careful with placement. I likethe siilcone pad enough that if cost wasn&#x27;t the issue I would buy another. Only time will tell if the silicone actually holds up for a lifetime as they claim? LiveWIRE needs to bring the price down for sure &amp; full disclosure they sent me an email &amp; requested I review the product. Otherwise I may have waited longer to see how it holds up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this curler a few weeks and it does it&#x27;s job.  Very smooth control and although it looks just like the one I had before that pinched me, this one never pinches.  I recommend this curler.  It arrived on time and it was packaged well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great Eyelash Curler!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak to the &amp;#34;pad never needs replacement&amp;#34; yet, as I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week, but everything else about it works great.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not flimsy like some that you purchase off a peg hook in the drug stores.&lt;br /&gt;I can however vouch for the fact that it doesn&#x27;t seem to crimp your eyelashes if you apply even pressure on the curler.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it seems like a good eyelash curler....that I hope to be using for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful curler. Not hard on my lashes and curls them so well.</li>
            <li> I gave you 5 stars because your product is well made, does not pinch &amp; it&#x27;s long enough.....here is MY problem:  I have NEVER found an eyelash curler that curls my impossible lashes!  Everything from blow drying the curler (for heat) to having them permed.  NOTHING has ever worked!&lt;br /&gt;I am a stylist &amp; never had a client w/my problem.  HELP!!!!  If you can, PLEASE!  They are also long so they have to be curled in 2 places, at the base &amp; half way up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your product is a good buy, it arrived quickly &amp; comfortable......it is ME that is a problem!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I would make a great example of the impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards&lt;br /&gt;Suzanne</li>
            <li> I got the livewire beauty eyelash curler in today. The packaging is very cute and eyecatching. The product itself gets the job done. The curler is easy to use. If you have never used one before you will need to get some practice time to master an eyelash curler down. I have short eyelashes that stick straight out no curl. These helped me to create more of an open eye look that I love. It easily opens and clamps down. Just be sure to count so that when you go to your other eye you hold it the same amount of time to get the same look. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is I would like to see the handle for your fingers just a tad bigger. I have short stumpy finger though so it is probably the standard size. I was sent this product free of charge to review this does not effect how I review a product as I keep it honest!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes have been falling out since being pregnant with my babies. This doesn&#x27;t pull them! So thankful I found this.</li>
            <li> Love love love it!! Exactly as described and doesn&#x27;t punch at All!!</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh, this has to be the BEST eyelash curler I have ever used!  I am in my 50&#x27;s and have been through them all!  This beats all the brand names by a long shot!  Keeps eyelashes separated and just beautiful to apply mascara too.  I recommend this!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> Not sure about all the hype, but it works as promised and if it really lasts I&#x27;ll be thrilled.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.. Bought it based on reviews expecting to be worth the money spend .. And it&#x27;s not..&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> The curler works wonderfully! It exceeded my expectations. The customer service is amazing! They take care of each customer in a very special way.</li>
            <li> Would buy it again (but it doesn&#x27;t look like I will need to) :)</li>
            <li> I love my new liveWIRE eyelash curler. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month, and it works just as good as it did the first time, and that&#x27;s using it every day.  As I get older I have less eyelashes to work with and I&#x27;m always looking for things to make my eyes look better. This eyelash curler does help give me a feeling of longer lashes. It&#x27;s also easy to use, even with arthritis in my hands. Thanks for a great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Effective, but I&#x27;m Asian w/short lashes so some pinching but good product</li>
            <li> Wow, so this eyelash curler doesn&#x27;t pinch. I was skeptical at first, but the silicon part is thick so it creates space and prevents pinching. Of course if you try pushing it into your eyelid far enough, it will pinch. I&#x27;ve only had this curler for a week but I like it. I&#x27;m hoping that I really won&#x27;t have to replace the silicon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;The silicone didn&#x27;t last as long as I hoped. After the curler cut through the silicone part, the curler started to pinch my eye. This curler lasts longer than conventional curlers, but it needs refills.</li>
            <li> I received my Professional Eyelash Curler today and used it on my eyelashes and my fake eyelashes and it kept my lashes curled for the whole day. It&#x27;s made of sturdy metal not flimsy, also it doesn&#x27;t pull on my lashes when I use it. I put it on my lashes squeezes it and hold for a few seconds and let go and they are curled great.</li>
            <li> Why would a man need an eyelash curler? Because as I have aged the weight of my eyelids has pushed against my eyelash&#x27;s causing them to get into my focal path and occasionally irritate the surface of my eyes. This curler is a miricle cure for me. The quality is unsurpassed. The ease of use, the quality, the care and concern of the &amp;#34;liveWIRE&amp;#34; team, all, Top Shelf!!!!</li>
            <li> Been using it for a week now and love it! Doesn&#x27;t pinch my eyes and its lightweight!  Curls lashes nicely!</li>
            <li> This curl my eye lashes good. It was comfortable to use. I really like it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic curler.  One 7 second pump is all it takes for lashes that stay beautifully curled all day.  I apply mascara right after I curl my lashes and my lashes look exactly the same at the end of the day.  I have tried two different types of mascara with the same results.  I remove my makeup at night and often there is still a bit of curl left when I wake up in the morning.  No pinching or other damage to date.  Will be ordering more as gifts.</li>
            <li> Been using this curler for a few months now, and I love it. Plus it&#x27;s easy to clean and I don&#x27;t have to worry about changing out padding.</li>
            <li> I  bought this  eyelash curler for a friend as a gift. She is very happy with this  eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> I love it. It works beautifully.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are very hard to curl.  This does a good job and doesn&#x27;t crimp them.  I do have to hold it closed a little longer than other curlers but it fans out my lashes well.  So far, so good!</li>
            <li> I have a fold on my upper eyelids that gives my eyes a distinct almond shape, and makes eye makeup somewhat of a challenge. I have not had a lot of luck with eyelash curlers, as they tend to be too narrow and pinch my skin. I end up having to hold them at an odd angle, and it makes it harder to curl my lashes evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LiveWire Beauty Professional Eyelash Curler has solved my problem. It has a nice, wide curling surface that allows me to rest it against my cheek comfortably to do the deed. All this time I thought I was bad with mascara, and now I&#x27;m finding out it was my curler instead. I don&#x27;t even have to change the pads! It&#x27;s time to experiment with all the makeup I wasn&#x27;t brave enough to try before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount for review purposes. My opinions and dazzling lashes are my own.</li>
            <li> I needed a new curler after using my current one WAAAAY past it&#x27;s shelf life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this new one for about a week now and am quite pleased with the results! The curler itself seems really well made.  I find that it curls my lashes much faster and seems to be a stronger hold.</li>
            <li> Super nice eyelash curler. The pad appears to be high quality, unlike my old eyelash curler that even with replacement pads goes flat so quickly. The grips on the handles make it comfy to use too. So far, this is the only curler that has lifted my eyelashes so well and they have stayed that way, all day. So glad I purchased this to replace my old one that I have had forever. Totally worth every penny!</li>
            <li> super super superrrr i can&#x27;t believe it it curls my lashes in a second it is&lt;br /&gt;amazing</li>
            <li> My wife tried this product out. The good: it never needs refills. The bad: it&#x27;s pretty similar quality to the ones that are sold in Walgreens and such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
            <li> I have been using an eyelash curler that I got from one of my monthly subscription boxes. I thought that the eyelash curler I was using was just great, until I tried this one and noticed a difference in how it made my eyelashes look. I usually curl my lashes and then apply mascara and curl them again after different mascara applications. Since this is how I have always curled my lashes, I found it a little upsetting that this curler never needs a replacement pad. I like to insert new replacement pads because I use the curler with mascara on so it gets dirty rather quickly and I don&#x27;t mind cleaning it but do prefer to change out the pads every so often. Overall, I am impressed with the way this curler curls my lashes because it makes them appear longer. This curler works and performs great and it gets the job done!</li>
            <li> Love this eye lash curler! It does not pinch my eyelid and is sturdy. Curls my eyelashes without making them look weird. easy to grip too.</li>
            <li> The eyelash curler is great and it is truth that is doesn&#x27;t pinch or pull. I have tried a lot and this is the best. Thank you</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and works very well!</li>
            <li> I received my professional eyelash curler with a discount. I love the way that they look. They do wonders on my eyes. All I have to do is put on my mascara take my eye curler and I&#x27;m ready for my day. The eye colors make my eyelashes pop.It made my eyelashes have the most beautiful look and its much easier to put on my mascara. it has become my new favorite</li>
            <li> Performs as described. Great customer service. They care and stand by their product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it! It works amazing and it does not pinch. I have long but thin eyelashes and it seems to work perfectly for me. The silicone really does bounce right back up.</li>
            <li> As a beauty blogger, I have tried out my share of eyelash curlers!&lt;br /&gt;This one is the best of the ones I have tried in the last year, without a doubt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it claims not to pinch. To be honest, I was cynical about that, because all the others I have used generally pinch and sometimes my eyelashes stick a little bit to the pad. This curler surprised me because when I was using it, I actually had to keep checking in the mirror to see if my eyelashes were IN it, because I didn&#x27;t feel anything. Very surprising. And when I was done, I released the handle and again I actually had to check in the mirror to see if my lashes were curled, because it didn&#x27;t FEEL like it had even grasped them. But it DID.&lt;br /&gt;I have actually never used a curler before that didn&#x27;t stick to my lashes a little bit, so I was not used to one like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am loving the silicone pad and the fact that I won&#x27;t need to replace it, EVER!&lt;br /&gt;I would still recommend cleaning it with a very gentle cleanser occasionally, as I do with all my beauty products that are washable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curling tip: You can either aim your hairdryer on low heat at the curling pad for about 30 seconds, or aim it at your eyelashes as you curl, and this will give you a little extra OOMPH and even more curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my photos below, you will see the photo of how well it curled my lashes, and it REALLY opens up my eyes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Very much recommend, and I appreciate receiving this in exchange for my true and unbiased opinion*</li>
            <li> I was in the market for a good quality eyelash curler and I have definitely found one! liveWire’s eyelash curler is an awesome product that comes in this cute black, purple, and pink packaging. It is extremely easy to use. The handles fit nicely into the fingers for steady control for curling your eyelashes.  After several uses, I can honestly say that it helped give my lashes a fuller, curvier curl. It doesn&#x27;t pull or feel harsh on your lashes due to the nice and soft padding on the curler. What I love most about this product is its slim yet sturdy design that provides you with a quality finished look and the curler fits easily into any makeup bag. Great buy!!!</li>
            <li> Great eyelash curler. Works excellent and is from a neat company who stands by their product.</li>
            <li> First one ever but it&#x27;s easy to use with soft bumpers that create great curl.  Fast shipping and great service!</li>
            <li> I have received this product completely free to try from Tomoson and opinions are 100 percent my own. I like eyelash curlers in general, but haven&#x27;t used one until i received this one. It&#x27;s a little scary at first because it&#x27;s really close to your eye when you&#x27;re doing this. I have heard stories of people who actually get their eyelashes ripped off because they&#x27;re not being careful enough, and it scared me, but i still use these. They&#x27;re really handy!</li>
            <li> These are amazing! Great quality and they curl really well.</li>
            <li> I have received this product to facilitate my review, none the less all opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;The product works well and does not pinch, or stick to your lashes like some that I  have used in the past. The silicone pads are wonderful in the fact that you never need to replace them. they are very lightweight and the handles also work very well allowing good grip. They is no tugging and sticking as your are curling the eyelashes. The packaging on this product is so cute and would also make nice for gift giving. I would highly recommend this product to add to your beauty routine.</li>
            <li> Decided to start using an eyelash curler as suggested in some makeup tutorials I&#x27;d been watching. I noticed a lot of other curlers had refills you needed to buy and people described them as &amp;#34;less pinch&amp;#34; but  never no pinch. These didn&#x27;t pinch at all, but curled my eyelashes just fine. Also, great for setting some falsies. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> liveWire has a hit on their hands!  I had the opportunity to try out their eyelash curler and I fell in love the minute I saw it.  I have to curl my eyelashes because they are so long that they hit my sunglasses.  This eyelash curler surpassed my expectations.  The curler arrived in very cute packaging that makes it ideal to gift to others.  They would make great stocking stuffers at Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost of these curlers is very small when you realize that you will never have to replace the pad.  Over time, that gets expensive.  This curler has a very professional look to it and it fit very well in my hands.  When I curl my eyelashes, I usually run the blow dryer in front of my lashes.  This way, I get a curl that stays all day.  With  my long eyelashes, this curler made my eyes stand out.  I loved the results and got compliments often. I was even asked if they were my real eyelashes.  The eyelash curler by liveWire is something you don&#x27;t want to miss.</li>
            <li> Awesome eyelash curler, however it pinches me every time.</li>
            <li> Awesome. No pinching. Gentle, well padded. Great product.</li>
            <li> Okay ladies, who keeps one of these tools in their makeup box? I grew up using one, but my daughters didn’t even know what it was at first! LOL So to break it in, we had beauty lessons at the kitchen table with this eyelash curler by LiveWire Beauty. Now that was fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First things first, I like having professional tools in my makeup case. Not that they’re always better, but if I know what I’m using is the same I’d get in a salon, I figure I’m better off getting the job done. This eyelash curler definitely felt like a salon quality tool in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It fits nice on your fingers and once the ladies got the hang of the motion required, there was no pinching or pulling of the eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you didn’t grow up learning how to use one of these, let me explain quickly that most folks have fairly straight lashes. By using an eyelash curler, you can curl them so your eyes look more “open” and alert. Then you apply your mascara as usual and go about your day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the eyelash curler by LiveWire Beauty though. It comes in really cute pink packaging which the girls loved. Plus, you don’t have to worry about buying and replacing those little pads like with most curlers. These are pretty resistant and spring right back after you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve read by heating it with a hair dryer for a few seconds before using it makes the curl last longer, but I don’t know that I personally saw a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I like the eyelash curler and it’s super simple to use, then toss in your bag for tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
            <li> I recently started trying out different brands of Eyelash Curlers...I was a novice when it came to curling lashes but I&#x27;ve been doing it more often than not, even if its just to &amp;#34;open my eyes&amp;#34; when I&#x27;m not planning on wearing makeup.  I recommend curling your lashes before applying mascara as doing so after will can gunk up the curler and also tug uncomfortably at your lashes. Another trick I have heard was to warm the curler with a hair dryer to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; the curl, I haven&#x27;t tried it but I may in the future, we&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the scissor handle style for curlers, it often makes my hands feel like I have to contort to handle the tool properly.  It does feel sturdy and offers good control and the hyperelastic silicon pad does not leave a crease so with regular cleaning, this should last the life of the curler. Is it the best curler I have used to date? Probably not, however it is a good value for this price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> This is the best curler, I have used.  Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product!  Cannot say enough about it! Fabulous product!!</li>
            <li> Finally! I&#x27;ve gone through 8 curlers in the past few months trying to find one that actually worked! I had a good one for a long time but it broke...I tried multiple expensive curlers, upwards of $20, and none of them worked well. I&#x27;d spend 5 minutes pressing and pressing just to get a subpar curl that wouldn&#x27;t last pas my mascara application. This curler is awesome...instant curl, holds all day! I&#x27;ve already shared with all my sisters :)</li>
            <li> The way it&#x27;s angled doesn&#x27;t grab my upper lid or that skin at the side like some do</li>
            <li> curls very well but pinches skin on the corner of eyes.</li>
            <li> Best eyelash curler ever. Permanent, no replacement pads. Works great, no pinching.</li>
            <li> I loved it!!! It truly curls your eyelashes beautifully!!</li>
            <li> Easy, good price and didn&#x27;t pinch my eyelid!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something different than the drugstore brands and came across these by Livewire. They do a great job of curling my lashes and I hope they last for a long time! Great customer service from the company as well! Thanks!</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler works great. I have only had for a few weeks so don&#x27;t know how long it will last yet but so far so good!</li>
            <li> I love this eyelash curler - the pad springs right back after use and it seems that it holds up well.  Makes my lashes curl and it stays all day.  Great purchase.</li>
            <li> works very well--I&#x27;m just getting use to it</li>
            <li> Works Great, I will respond again in a year and let you know if the pad is still in good shape.</li>
            <li> Very nice eyelash curler. I have had this product for a couple of weeks now. I especially like the size and the fact that my eyelashes and eyelids don&#x27;t get pinched when I use it.</li>
            <li> Well this certainly did not live up to the expectations I had after reading the customers reviews.  I had expected this to be the ultimate eyelash curler.  And for $15.00, it&#x27;s got to be worth it, right?!  Sorry to say I was somewhat disappointed.  I have very long lashes that I have been curling for about 30 years, so I am well seasoned regarding curling lashes (and curlers themselves), and this is definitely not the &#x27;be all to end all&#x27; in the eyelash curler department.  I am using it daily, and have been since I received it back in February, but it&#x27;s really only because I paid so much for it. I do not like that my eyelashes come out differently every day.  Also, it is very rare that one, or both, of my eyelids do NOT get pinched.</li>
            <li> Great eyelash curler, my eyelashes stay curly all day.  Like the fact that I do not have to worry about refills.</li>
            <li> Great Eyelash curler. Haven&#x27;t tried it a lot lately because i haven&#x27;t gone out but I&#x27;m sure it will serve its purpose when i do.</li>
            <li> Indeed the best eyelash curler I have ever used. Also great followup by seller with instructions and promise that rubber cushion piece will never have to be replaced. I am sold on this item.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product! All of my eyelashes get curled, unlike other curlers. No pinching. No ripping out eyelashes. No need to replace rubber. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This curler really does not pinch and makes my lashes look so long.</li>
            <li> these are great, well made and do a great job. I was tempted to go for less expensive type but reviews swayed me. I am very happy. I even received a separate e-mail telling me of the lifetime satisfaction and how to properly use and clean them. Highly recommend and am so happy with these.</li>
            <li> Every time I use these eyelash curlers they pinch my skin!!!!!!!  Other than that I like they way they curl my lashes but I can&#x27;t stand them pinching me.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye lash curler I have ever used. My lashes stay beautifully curled all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having a little trouble getting used to this curler but after using Maybelline for so many years, I guess that&#x27;s to be expected as it&#x27;s shape is just slightly different somehow. I love the fact that you don&#x27;t have to replace the pad.Great idea!</li>
            <li> This is a very comfortable curler.  A representative from the company emailed me soon after it was delivered and told some good tips for how to use and maintain it, which was very helpful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lash curler about 2 weeks and so far, so good. It does a good job curling my lashes. The little pad is cushy and hasn&#x27;t flatten out like most pads. I honestly don&#x27;t notice a big difference in the curler itself in comparison to other lash curlers. I guess I&#x27;ll have to give it another few weeks to really be able to tell. Overall, good product.</li>
            <li> I do like the curler, but I must warn - it says it never pinches.  I can&#x27;t say it pinches any less than my Revlon curler did (which I only replaced because I couldn&#x27;t find new inserts for it).  Overall this curler does a good job, but don&#x27;t buy into the hype that it never pinches .. you still need to be careful.</li>
            <li> I could not be Happier with my LiveWire Professional Eyelash Curler! It is extremely lightweight. The padding never pinches or pulls my eyelashes. It curls on the first time. The expert design fits perfectly over my eye without the worry of getting my eyelid by mistake. It flawlessly gets all my eyelashes in every time. If I use it with my mascara already on it never pulls my mascara off like my previous one did. It never gets sticky my other one did either which I love! The &amp;#34;grippies&amp;#34; on the handles are soft and easy to hold. They are also very durable. I have so much stuff in my make up back and purse all the time a lot of my beauty items easily get destroyed, not these babies! They have passed the test! I couldn&#x27;t be happier with mine!

            <li> This is one of the eyelash curler I have ever had. Very good quality. I tried other brands but their refills always fall off after couple of uses. I am happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> This professional eyelash curler by liveWIRE is a decent eyelash curler. The grips have a bit of a &amp;#34;rubber&amp;#34; smell to them, though not overly strong. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if they helped or hindered, but after a few uses, I think that they help, making it easier to keep a steadier grip. They curl my lashes well, though after multiple tries and positions, I still can&#x27;t get the longest straighter lashes on the outer section of my eyelashes to curl. I have yet to find an eyelash curler that will curl those up and they are the ones I want some curl in the most. I am also dubious about the no pinching, as I think that is largely due to user error, not an eyelash curler itself, and I almost always pinch myself occasionally with any curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure how I feel about the silicone strip never needing replacing. There were no instructions, but I&#x27;m assuming that means that it can be washed and it will retain its original shape rather than eventually get flattened down like regular ones do, but I&#x27;m still uncertain how cleanly that would be after a few years or if it will truly retain its shape for years. Only time can tell. Obviously, that would save money over the long run, so I am assuming that&#x27;s why the higher price point than most other eyelash curls that are closer to half the price and work pretty much just as well. This one did seem to grip my eyelashes a bit better than my current one and that may be the silicone (or it could be mine needs a new pad).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is a good eyelash curler, but I think they would sell a lot better if they lowered the price point a bit. I received this eyelash curler at a promotional price for the purpose of product testing and feedback. All opinions expressed are based on my personal experience with the product.</li>
            <li> Great eyelash curler!</li>
            <li> No complaints!  Curls nicely and does not pull eyelashes out.</li>
            <li> I can no longer find refills for my Cover Girl eyelash curler that I&#x27;ve had for over 25 years (hey, it works!), so this one looked like a good replacement because it states that refills are never needed.  I thought this would be a smart buy because refills in general seem to have disappeared from stores (who wants to buy a whole new curler every time it needs new refills??).  It also states that it will not pinch or pull...  I had to return this curler because it pinched my eyelids so badly that I just couldn&#x27;t stand it!  The angle of the curler is different than my old one, so maybe that&#x27;s why it was pinching?  Also, the pad is very stiff and not cushiony, so maybe that&#x27;s why?  All I know is that I would not recommend this to anyone because it is painful to use.  I&#x27;m on the hunt again to find refills for my old curler!</li>
            <li> The curlers that I&#x27;ve had before I had trouble with them slipping in my fingers and pinching to the point that it would bring tears to my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one doesn&#x27;t slip and doesn&#x27;t pinch or pull my eyelashes.  Out of the previous eyelash curlers I&#x27;ve had this one is comfortable and quick and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hated trying to replace the pads on my old eyelash curler, I could never get them to go back in right- and I would often wait too long to replace them... I love that with this one I don&#x27;t have to worry about replacing the pads ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this curler and will be ordering one for my sister and my mom.</li>
            <li> I over the last year just started using eye lash curlers. I have tried a few different kinds and brands. I like how this one does not need replacing of the pad. The pad after using bounce right back up to it starting place. There is no springs on this one and I like that because it seems more sturdier and that is very important for me. There are grips on the spots you put your figures in making it so much more comfortable to use. I love the curl that this curler gives to my eye lashes. I have recieved this curler for free to give my honest and unbasied review.  This works great and is a very sturdy product I suggest to anyone looking to buy a new or get their frist eye lash curler to get this one you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, good results, do not anticipate any problems with it long term.</li>
            <li> I love this eyelash curler!!!  Very comfortable to use--does not pinch or pull or destroy my eyeliner!!  I also love that it does not need replacement pads.  Eyelashes keep the curl too!!&lt;br /&gt;~Patty Wilson</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t curled my eyelashes in years so did a lot of research before I bought this product.  I do wish that it would have included some instructions or at least suggestion because I just cannot get my eyelashes to curl.  I searched for hints on the internet, only to find that if I heat the curler with my hair dryer as often suggested, the pads want to fall out.  But the shape fits my eye and it never pulls my lashes, which is why I stopped curling them in the first place.  I think that I am just doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> The best I have ever had -- probably will last me a life time,</li>
            <li> These are great and you don&#x27;t need replacements.</li>
            <li> It pinches hard. I tried holding it at a different angle like it says too but it still pinches.</li>
            <li> I really love this tool. It really works very well. Glad I got one, and one for my daughter too. We are both very pleased!!</li>
            <li> Getting ready to go out. You have your hair done, your cutest/hottest outfit on, your foundation, eyeliner, lipstick, and everything else you could think of all perfectly in place. So, what is the one thing you are missing? Why, perfectly curled eyelashes of course!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I get ready to go either to work or to go out on a date, I always make sure that I look put together but I always seem to skimp out on my eyelashes. Which is crazy! My eyelashes are pretty... decent. They are a little thin and are a little flat. I usually just brush a few strokes of mascara on and think it looks fine but ever since I started curling my lashes again, I have noticed a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LiveWIRE Beauty Eyelash Curler is absolutely phenomenal. The handles are textured for a non-slip grip which makes primping really easy. They are compact enough to fit into your makeup bag or purse so if you ever want to curl your lashes on the go, you can without a problem. It has a very sleek design with a shiny finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This curler does not come with pads but, in all honesty, you don&#x27;t need them. This curler is perfect for curling your lashes without any tugging, pulling, or pain. I know they always say beauty is pain but it is even better when you can get beauty minus the actual pain. I have had issues with past curlers getting snagged on my lashes which caused them to tug and even make  some of my lashes fall out. Ugh! It was awful. With this LiveWIRE eyelash curler I have had absolutely no issues and I get perfectly curled lashed every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design of this curler is perfect to fit all eye shapes and sizes. I have relatively small eyes that are a bit narrow which can make for some hassle with curling, using other curlers that is. This curler I simply place my lashes in, squeeze the handle down, and all of my lashes are perfectly in place. I used to curl my lashes AFTER applying mascara which I have come to discover is one big no-no. Now, I curl my lashes first to give them that extra boost and definition and then apply some mascara afterwards to give them a bit more volume and darkening them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am in love with this eyelash curler. It is PERFECT as it does not tug, pull, or snag on my lashes and it is just the right size to fit all of my lashes in at one time. They give me that extra little boost that I want without taking much time and, even better, without any pain or irritation. I would definitely recommend this curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclosure: I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased review.lashes first to give them that extra boost and definition and then apply some mascara afterwards to give them a bit more volume and darkening them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am in love with this eyelash curler.
