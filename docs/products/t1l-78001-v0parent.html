    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>my hair stylist is impressed.</li>
            <li>The product is a very good one</li>
            <li>Very good for scalp, also good for grooming short/medium hair.</li>
            <li>I am quite happy with this product and plan to buy it again.</li>
            <li>This serum is great.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve been happy applying this every night.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>I thought it would be more oily - but the consistency is closer to water - which means it works perfectly in the morning before blow-drying.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with all the Andalou products I&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li>Wish there was more product for the price.</li>
            <li>feeling more youthful already.</li>
            <li>Started using this stuff and more hair fell out.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the ingredients are actually effective or if this serum is just a great extra detangler.</li>
            <li>Great all natural product to assist with hair growth!</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>In two weeks, I saw significant growth.</li>
            <li>The price was right for a good deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>I was recommended a chemical brand for repair, however I wanted a more natural option.</li>
            <li>I put it on and immediately my hair (which is short, and has some curl) looked like it did 10 or more years ago--</li>
            <li>lively, springy curl, a lot more life in general.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for over two months without noticing any positive changes.</li>
            <li>I think it really helps give texture to my hair.</li>
            <li>and I started losing way too much hair.  </li>
            <li>fantastic pdt&lt;br /&gt;true results within 2 months of daily use</li>
            <li>I cut my hair short and found this fantastic product in a Seattle Health Food store only to find out the product is from Marin where I live!</li>
            <li>I have not noticed any new hair growth, but I have noticed the amount of hair falling out has been reduced</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had fine/thin hair, and after having surgery under general anesthesia, I lost so much of it that patches of my scalp were visible.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product and it is considerably cheaper on Amazon than at my local whole foods stores.  </li>
            <li>I chose this product because it is natural.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to really see results but seems to help soften hair.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t tell whether any hair is growing back, but there seems to be less loss.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I am not sure if its actually making my hair thicker, but it certainly looks like it.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I haven&#x27;t used it long enough</li>
            <li> I use copious amounts of extra volume conditioner in the shower then use this stuff afterwards while my hair is still wet.</li>
            <li> A bit expensive, but worth it (use sparingly)</li>
            <li> Not much Argan oil in this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d still try other products from them though.</li>
            <li> Apparently hair loss is common with anesthesia.</li>
            <li> I started using this product (along with the corresponding shampoo and conditioner) when life moved my hormones down the road</li>
            <li> It does make my hair appear slight</li>
            <li> Only complaint would be how small the bottle is.</li>
            <li> Will continue to use a little longer to see.</li>
            <li> It kinda dried my hair out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different stem cell topicals for hair loss of varying prices and they&#x27;ve all proven to be useless to me.</li>
            <li> Too expensive as the bottle size won&#x27;t last even a month of use.</li>
            <li> Too greasy, could not use long enough to see if it worked, made my roots look awful.</li>
            <li> I go through it in a couple of days, so it gets expensive.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Nothing to write home about. It kinda dried my hair out. I won&#x27;t be ordering it again, though. I&#x27;d still try other products from them though.</li>
            <li> did not like the product at all</li>
            <li> Hair appears thicker. Wish there was more product for the price.</li>
            <li> Great all natural product to assist with hair growth! No side effects! It&#x27;s amazing! Already sed a difference in my hair!</li>
            <li> This is ineffective for my hair loss. I&#x27;ve used a few different stem cell topicals for hair loss of varying prices and they&#x27;ve all proven to be useless to me.</li>
            <li> I think it really helps give texture to my hair.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because it is natural.  It does make my hair appear slight thicker.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it for anyone experiencing thinning hair.</li>
            <li> this product does what it says it will. so far so good. feeling more youthful already. my hair stylist is impressed.</li>
            <li> Started using this stuff and more hair fell out. Then Before I started.</li>
            <li> Too greasy, could not use long enough to see if it worked, made my roots look awful. Same look as Rogaine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had fine/thin hair, and after having surgery under general anesthesia, I lost so much of it that patches of my scalp were visible. Apparently hair loss is common with anesthesia. I was recommended a chemical brand for repair, however I wanted a more natural option. I am quite happy with this product and plan to buy it again. I thought it would be more oily - but the consistency is closer to water - which means it works perfectly in the morning before blow-drying. My hair feels thicker and stronger and looks fuller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for awhile.  I&#x27;m on my second bottle.  It&#x27;s cooling and soothing.  I really can&#x27;t tell whether any hair is growing back, but there seems to be less loss.  I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with all the Andalou products I&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li> I like product, but i just wish it were a bit thicker.</li>
            <li> Post surgery, my hair fell out in clumps. I cut my hair short and found this fantastic product in a Seattle Health Food store only to find out the product is from Marin where I live! In two weeks, I saw significant growth. To thank Andalou Naturals, I have shared this product with my family and friends, especially survivors of breast cancer.</li>
            <li> Very good for scalp, also good for grooming short/medium hair. A bit expensive, but worth it (use sparingly)</li>
            <li> This serum is great.  I put it on and immediately my hair (which is short, and has some curl) looked like it did 10 or more years ago--lively, springy curl, a lot more life in general.  I wish I had taken before and after pictures!</li>
            <li> i am still using the product. i notice lesser hair falling</li>
            <li> Too expensive as the bottle size won&#x27;t last even a month of use. Not much Argan oil in this product. If it was priced lower or in a larger size for this price I would buy it again perhaps.</li>
            <li> Some thickening of hair but no re-growth at all.</li>
            <li> Adds some thickening elements to my hair. I have very thin hair so I&#x27;ve been happy applying this every night. I am not sure if its actually making my hair thicker, but it certainly looks like it.</li>
            <li> There has been no evidence of any improvement.  Perhaps I haven&#x27;t used it long enough but I was hoping to see some trace of something happening.</li>
            <li> The price was right for a good deep conditioner. Don&#x27;t let the name steer you away . I&#x27;ll use it as that</li>
            <li> I started using this product (along with the corresponding shampoo and conditioner) when life moved my hormones down the road and I started losing way too much hair.  I&#x27;ve used it for about 2 years now and am a big fan.  I don&#x27;t know if the ingredients are actually effective or if this serum is just a great extra detangler. I use copious amounts of extra volume conditioner in the shower then use this stuff afterwards while my hair is still wet. BTW, I dumped the shampoo and conditioner....for some reason they made my hair look and feel like straw. I highly recommend the product and it is considerably cheaper on Amazon than at my local whole foods stores.  I gave it a four rather than a five only because the shipping was a bit sloooooooow.  Lesson learned....I&#x27;ll be buying a backup supply before I run out of my current bottle.</li>
            <li> There is no expiration date on this product.  I found some used scratches on the bottle when I received it.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to really see results but seems to help soften hair. Will continue to use a little longer to see. Only complaint would be how small the bottle is. I go through it in a couple of days, so it gets expensive.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any new hair growth, but I have noticed the amount of hair falling out has been reduced</li>
            <li> The product is a very good one</li>
            <li> I have been using it for over two months without noticing any positive changes. Will give it a try for another couple of months.</li>
            <li> fantastic pdt&lt;br /&gt;true results within 2 months of daily use</li>
