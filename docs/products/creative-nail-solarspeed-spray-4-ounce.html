            <li>Very healthy oil for your nails.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the performance of this product that is dubbed a &amp;#34;conditioning polish dryer&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to use this, too, when you are doing any kind of nail work - not just for drying.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell!  </li>
            <li>I love CND products - they rock!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love the product!</li>
            <li>and then I ordered more for myself!</li>
            <li>I use this before I head out the door for a nice conditioned look for my nails.</li>
            <li>Very pleasant, no harsh fumes.</li>
            <li>It dries my nails so super fast and smells delicious!</li>
            <li>and I love it at home for when I do my nails in between seeing her.  </li>
            <li>but it smells fantastic and is a nice conditioner for the nails and cuticles</li>
            <li>This spray is perfect to dry the nail after a coat of polish.</li>
            <li>Excellent - dries nails in less than 1 minute.  </li>
            <li>When I applied this quick dry spray to my polished nails it worked great.  </li>
            <li>As with the SolarOil, this has a sweet almond scent and leaves a bit of oil that you can massage into your nail.  </li>
            <li>It contains jojoba oil, vitamin E, and sweet almond oil  </li>
            <li>A trick to using this successfully, follow the directions and let the polish dry a bit before spraying it on.</li>
            <li>It works well to dry/set the polish and moisturize at the same time.... and the sweet almond oil/scent is really nice.</li>
            <li>This is worth the money.</li>
            <li>Really interested in caring for my nails.</li>
            <li>However, &amp;#34;speed&amp;#34; might not be the correct name for this product as the directions read: &amp;#34;Lightly mist on nails one minute after last coat of polish or top coat is applied.</li>
            <li>Smells like almond yumminess and really does speed up drying.</li>
            <li>Very natural-scented, takes away from the pungent acetone from polish - not to mention conditions your nails in the process of quicker drying.</li>
            <li>It dries nails fast if you are one of those &amp;#34;cooking spray&amp;#34; users and want to order something made for nails.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if it really helps speed up drying or not</li>
            <li>Helps avoid those little smudges you get right after you&#x27;ve put your top coat on.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t drag your hand through the silverware drawer or anything, but it will prevent LIGHT smudges immediately after painting.</li>
            <li>Been in love with the smell and the feel of it since I started getting pedis a few years ago but could never find it anywhere.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really use to make polish dry fast.  </li>
            <li>not drying on skin.replaces my old product with one spray.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work quite as fast as the label says (5 minutes) and if your nailpolish is thick it can still rub off, but it definitely dries faster and makes my life more convenient.</li>

            <li> Smells like almond yumminess and really does speed up drying. I love CND products - they rock! If you&#x27;re on the fence...just get it.</li>
            <li> This spray is perfect to dry the nail after a coat of polish.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years.  It works well to dry/set the polish and moisturize at the same time.... and the sweet almond oil/scent is really nice.</li>
            <li> This smells sooooo good. That alone is reason to buy it. Very natural-scented, takes away from the pungent acetone from polish - not to mention conditions your nails in the process of quicker drying. Love it!</li>
            <li> Helps avoid those little smudges you get right after you&#x27;ve put your top coat on.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong you can&#x27;t drag your hand through the silverware drawer or anything, but it will prevent LIGHT smudges immediately after painting.</li>
            <li> And it smells SO GOOD!  It&#x27;s good to use this, too, when you are doing any kind of nail work - not just for drying.  In between manicures, I use this stuff if my cuticles get dry, too.  Very healthy oil for your nails.</li>
            <li> Love the product! Shipping was horrible, leaked everything all over my mailbox.</li>
            <li> I use this before I head out the door for a nice conditioned look for my nails.Will purchase again.Great product!</li>
            <li> My manicurist uses this when I see her at the salon.  I loved it there and I love it at home for when I do my nails in between seeing her.  A trick to using this successfully, follow the directions and let the polish dry a bit before spraying it on. Also, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of all things CND and use the regular polishes and the Shellac process.  I recently purchased this item for use when doing my regular manicure.  I use the CND Sticky Base Coat followed by two coats of CND nail Lacquer, followed by CND Air Dry Fast set.  Now I follow that process with the SolarSpeed Spray.  This bottle is a bit expensive but since it comes out in a light mist I expect it to last a long time.  As with the SolarOil, this has a sweet almond scent and leaves a bit of oil that you can massage into your nail.  It contains jojoba oil, vitamin E, and sweet almond oil  However, &amp;#34;speed&amp;#34; might not be the correct name for this product as the directions read: &amp;#34;Lightly mist on nails one minute after last coat of polish or top coat is applied. Wait an additional five minutes to ensure a thorough set.&amp;#34;  I am very pleased with the performance of this product that is dubbed a &amp;#34;conditioning polish dryer&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> When I applied this quick dry spray to my polished nails it worked great.  However the next day whenever I washed my hands there was a white coating streaked  on the polish.</li>
            <li> This is worth the money. It dries nails fast if you are one of those &amp;#34;cooking spray&amp;#34; users and want to order something made for nails. It was a gift and then I ordered more for myself!</li>
            <li> It dries my nails so super fast and smells delicious! Like almond paste. Very pleasant, no harsh fumes. Does the job.</li>
            <li> Great smell! It smalls like almonds! It doesn&#x27;t work quite as fast as the label says (5 minutes) and if your nailpolish is thick it can still rub off, but it definitely dries faster and makes my life more convenient. I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Been in love with the smell and the feel of it since I started getting pedis a few years ago but could never find it anywhere. Don&#x27;t know if it really helps speed up drying or not but it smells fantastic and is a nice conditioner for the nails and cuticles</li>
