            <li>I suggest exfoliating lips once a week and applying a good chapstick/balm about 30 mins before applying, and using a flat angled brush to apply foundation around lining of your lips to really lock it in and get the best out of any lip stick and liner for all-day wear.</li>

            <li> I bought this thinking it was eyeliner, found out it was LIPliner, but used it as eyeliner anyway! Its soft and a nice shade of purple, so who will know if I don&#x27;t tell them, LOL!</li>
            <li> This color isn&#x27;t really a violet, it&#x27;s more of a burgundy, which is fine by me. I bought it to wear under Revlon&#x27;s Black Cherry lipstick. The color is beautiful. The product glides on so smooth. NYX is an amazing company, and it&#x27;s SO worth the price.</li>

            <li> I love it!! It&#x27;s creamy and goes on well! Will be buying more shades soon!!! Thanks NYX for introducing me to the world of lip liners!</li>
            <li> For me, it just wasn&#x27;t purple enough. I bought this and the burgundy, and they both were very similar in color.</li>
            <li> NYX is the ONLY lip liner I use. It goes on smooth and even and lasts throughout the day. It will even hold up during a sharpening.</li>

            <li> That was not what the colour looked like at all. It was more of a reddish purple. I put it on my lips, but I was disappointed with the colour.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous deep plum color</li>
            <li> Works great with their &amp;#34;Copenhagen&amp;#34; matte lip, if applied allover lips it really helps it stay on and keep that matte look.

            <li> I am very much satisfied with both the product and the seller. I had no problems with it whatsoever! I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Great colour and application. However, the pencil is rather short.</li>
            <li> I love how easy this lip liber goes on! It doesn&#x27;t tug at your mouth while lining. The color was darker than I expected but I have figured out ways to adapt it.</li>
            <li> I have never had a problems with NYX products and this is no exception. I like how easy it goes on and it lines my lips nicely. I wear it with a pink lipstick for definition and people always say how nice it looks.</li>
            <li> These are great lip iners in all different colors, and they don&#x27;t brek easy nd last a long time. Recommeended</li>
            <li> My favorite color!  Looked all over for it since this color isn&#x27;t carried at Ulta.</li>
