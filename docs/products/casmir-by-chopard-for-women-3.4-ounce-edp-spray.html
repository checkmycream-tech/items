            <li>I have been wearing this perfume for years and have had many compliments on it...</li>
            <li>My favorite fragrance on my wife.  </li>
            <li>I have used this before and love the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>so I did not order from Amazon but from another party to see if it would be better.  </li>
            <li>Love the fragrance</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful soft Parfum I used it&lt;br /&gt;Years</li>
            <li>It has a warm scent with vanilla like tones yet is not overly sweet.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find my favorite perfume at such a great price!</li>
            <li>I bought this for my Mother&#x27;s birthday, and she loved it, thank you so much.  </li>
            <li>The original scent remains for more than 24 hours until I have a shover</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for everyone that wants to smell good!</li>
            <li>love this parfum and it&#x27;s hard to find in the stores, so very happy to get it online!</li>
            <li>It has fantastic sillage and staying power, one I&#x27;d consider &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; in it&#x27;s approach.</li>
            <li>Buy at your own risk, or if you really like baby powder.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is a warm and gentle vanilla musk.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing not overly sweet but very feminine</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable, the shipping was fast and I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I believe this warm, sensual, cozy, fragrance is one of a kind.  </li>
            <li>Nothing but pure J&amp;J baby powder start to finish, and so strong it&#x27;s gagging.  </li>
            <li>What a fantastic surprise to find my old MIA favorite perfume right under my nose.</li>
            <li>I use this Casmir for more than 10 years and and I am one hundred percent sure that this is an imitation of the original.</li>
            <li>was so happy to find Casmir one of my favorite Parfums  and very hard to find until now</li>
            <li>It is attractively packaged in a classy looking round bottle, so it looks very nice left out on your dressing table.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to find that Amazon offers it to us.</li>
            <li>It shares some of Thierry mugler&#x27;s notes but it is different in many ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wearing it makes me believe that I&#x27;m in some middle eastern bazaar or dancing to some exotic music.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered several perfumes through Amazon and have been very pleased so far--but this was a total dud.  </li>
            <li>Either way, this smelled like pure baby powder.  </li>
            <li>Am I a victim like so many others of water downed perfume????  </li>
            <li>first started wearing this at the end of high school in 1991 .</li>
            <li>/&gt;If y like that fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;Great job</li>
            <li>( very rare)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast shipper</li>
            <li>very boozy on me, intoxicating, sticky-sweet.</li>
            <li>The real thing.</li>
            <li>Very sultry and spicy scent.  </li>
            <li>, have a friend wear it too, so you can give each other feedback \\&quot;For better or worse\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This fragrance has a spicey vanilla sweet note, and it&#x27;s one of the few fragrances I&#x27;ve ever been able to wear without getting a headache; in fact, it&#x27;s the only fragrance I&#x27;ve worn since I discovered it years ago!</li>
            <li>It has always been a high end</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend Casmir for everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If u love vanilla, soft musk with a little kick than this is it.</li>
            <li>ago a lot of vanilla very soft</li>
            <li>This perfume is very soft and my husbsnd loves the scent.</li>
            <li>Definitely smells unique on each individual.  </li>
            <li>The only problem is it appears to evaporate much sooner than when I buy in a store.</li>
            <li>I immediately went to customer service to request a refund, only to learn that fragrances are non-returnable due to some special handling regulations, apparently.  </li>
            <li>I wear no other perfume.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Does smell expensive, and classic in that way that 1920&#x27;s high-end prostitutes are classic.</li>
            <li> so different than any other scent on the market...</li>
            <li> I read so many bad reviews</li>
            <li> This subtle fragrance is soft and feminine, yet lingers throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Extreme gourmand scent, reminds me of RUM BALLS without the chocolate.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little vanilla, a little chocolate, a lot of elegance.</li>
            <li> it for a few days and spray it on denim or leather jacket.</li>
            <li> I had been having trouble finding this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I think of this one.</li>
            <li> This is hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Then all of a sudden they stopped carrying it which was so disappointing.</li>
            <li> This is not good.</li>
            <li> Totally disappointed :(</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this perfume!!! Don&#x27;t ever stop selling it!!! Highly recommend for everyone that wants to smell good!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this product for several years after it disappeared from store shelves.  Happy to be able to enjoy this wonderful scent again!</li>
            <li> Love love love this scent!</li>
            <li> I love it. I have used it for many years.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite scent. It has a warm scent with vanilla like tones yet is not overly sweet.</li>
            <li> No complaints, great price, packaged well, easy transaction.</li>
            <li> love it and at a great price</li>
            <li> My perfume arrived quickly, nicely packaged and smelling great!  I bought this for my Mother&#x27;s birthday, and she loved it, thank you so much.  I received a lovely product at a great price and would buy from this seller again, excellent service.</li>
            <li> I believe this warm, sensual, cozy, fragrance is one of a kind.  ( very rare)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If u love vanilla, soft musk with a little kick than this is it. It shares some of Thierry mugler&#x27;s notes but it is different in many ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Actual retail price on [...] is 150 dollars and ( by request only) u can verify this!&lt;br /&gt;Click on accessories or type casmir in their search bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first started wearing this at the end of high school in 1991 . Then&#x27; 5 yrs later it started to disappear from - Saks 5th Ave. etc... It has always been a high end product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Around this time perfume shops were just getting started in the USA and someone told me to try them. They had it back then but it disappeared again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Now amazon and their online perfume sellers still do. And they only charge a fraction of the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Received compliments all the time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I loved the fragrance -it just seemed to suit me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The bottle is a showpiece!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I hope many of u try it, at these remarkable prices you can afford it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Wear it for a few days and spray it on denim or leather jacket. A spritz on paper would be a good idea too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Also, have a friend wear it too, so you can give each other feedback \\&quot;For better or worse\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Being able to smell it on someone else may help you and they may end up loving Casmir by Chopard too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I highly recommend Casmir for everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amy xoxo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  What a fantastic surprise to find my old MIA favorite perfume right under my nose.</li>
            <li> This fragrance has a spicey vanilla sweet note, and it&#x27;s one of the few fragrances I&#x27;ve ever been able to wear without getting a headache; in fact, it&#x27;s the only fragrance I&#x27;ve worn since I discovered it years ago! People are always asking me what it is, and my husband loves it!</li>
            <li> This perfume is very soft and my husbsnd loves the scent. I would recommend this to anyone who does not like an overpowering scent.</li>
            <li> My first Chopard Eau de Parfum was purchased in Germany, but I was not able to purchase it in the US until I received it as a gift., ordered from Amazon.com. It is the only Parfum I use.&lt;br /&gt;Ingrid Hinds</li>
            <li> I have used this perfume since it came out on the market.  I always get compliments when I use this perfume somebody always stops me and ask what kind of perfume I am wearing.</li>
            <li> Smells like bug spray!</li>
            <li> I had been having trouble finding this I the stores. I&#x27;m really glad because it is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance. So happy to find it. Most favorite perfume. Price was wonderful.</li>
            <li> love this parfum and it&#x27;s hard to find in the stores, so very happy to get it online! Love it!!</li>
            <li> was so happy to find Casmir one of my favorite Parfums  and very hard to find until now</li>
            <li> Wonderful. I used to wear this all the time years ago.  Then all of a sudden they stopped carrying it which was so disappointing. Used to get so many compliments on the smell. A fan forever. Thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing not overly sweet but very feminine</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find my favorite perfume at such a great price!</li>
            <li> The only problem is it appears to evaporate much sooner than when I buy in a store. This is not good.</li>
            <li> My lady loves this scent. When she is happy I am happy. She smells damn good.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this Eau de Perfume with all my french speaking vigor.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my wife.  She loves this scent .  Fast shipper</li>
            <li> People stop me and ask for the name!  Love it.</li>
            <li> so different than any other scent on the market...it is my go-to scent.  Sandalwood and musky, it lasts all day.  It doesn&#x27;t fade like so many perfumes.</li>
            <li> Extreme gourmand scent, reminds me of RUM BALLS without the chocolate. Maybe a peach rum ball? I&#x27;m not sure what I think of this one. It has fantastic sillage and staying power, one I&#x27;d consider &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; in it&#x27;s approach. I just don&#x27;t know if I like it... very boozy on me, intoxicating, sticky-sweet. Does smell expensive, and classic in that way that 1920&#x27;s high-end prostitutes are classic. Might work well as a base-layer with something woody to compliment it. Recommended with reservations.</li>
            <li> after 15 years, people still stop me to ask what I am wearing.  Definitely smells unique on each individual.  Men LOVE it!</li>
            <li> My favorite. The real thing. Purchased from Amazon/shipped by Amazon.  The only way I will purchase this item.</li>
            <li> I use this Casmir for more than 10 years and and I am one hundred percent sure that this is an imitation of the original. The original scent remains for more than 24 hours until I have a shover but this one fade away in 3-4 hours. Totally disappointed :(</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this perfume for years and have had many compliments on it...warm vanilla scent with woodsy undertones...great product..AAA</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my signature fragrance.  I wear no other perfume.  It&#x27;s a little vanilla, a little chocolate, a lot of elegance.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got an imitation or an old bottle, or if the bottle was exposed to extreme temperatures maybe...  Either way, this smelled like pure baby powder.  That&#x27;s it.  No vanilla notes, no woodsy tones, no fruit notes.  Nothing but pure J&amp;J baby powder start to finish, and so strong it&#x27;s gagging.  I immediately went to customer service to request a refund, only to learn that fragrances are non-returnable due to some special handling regulations, apparently.  I am waiting to hear back from Amazon if I have any recourse.  I&#x27;ve ordered several perfumes through Amazon and have been very pleased so far--but this was a total dud.  Buy at your own risk, or if you really like baby powder.</li>
            <li> This is a great perfume.  Wearing it makes me believe that I&#x27;m in some middle eastern bazaar or dancing to some exotic music.  Very sultry and spicy scent.  One of my all-time favorites!!!</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance on my wife.  If I had a girlfriend, I would probably buy it for her too.  This fragrance is a warm and gentle vanilla musk.</li>
            <li> Took a gamble on this as a gift for my mom since I was only going off the scent description. Couldn&#x27;t have been received better! Absolutely loved it!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this perfume. Could not find it in any stores. It&#x27;s not over powering when she wears it.</li>
            <li> I recived it as said i would, I am very pleased, I love casmir.everything is aok,  very pleased with my order. ty</li>
            <li> One of my girl friends wanted to try this item and she loved it so much that she&#x27;s now wanting 2 more!!</li>
            <li> I have used this before and love the fragrance.  The only thing is it does not last.  Two hours after there is no trace of it.  Am I a victim like so many others of water downed perfume????  I read so many bad reviews so I did not order from Amazon but from another party to see if it would be better.  Guess not...the seller was IPickBeauty.   It arrived on time and was as advertised.</li>
            <li> This perfume is timeless. Love the fragrance</li>
