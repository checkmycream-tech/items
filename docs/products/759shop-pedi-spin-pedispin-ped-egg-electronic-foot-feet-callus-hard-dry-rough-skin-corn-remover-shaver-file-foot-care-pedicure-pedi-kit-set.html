    <ol>
            <li>Great for foot maintenance!</li>
            <li>This is a great buy for the money.</li>
            <li>A good product.</li>
            <li>To my surprise, My foot felt very smooth.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t expect more for the price.</li>
            <li>OK boys and girls, I have used Pedispin for a year now and it works well.</li>
            <li>It takes a light touch, patience and some time to gradually work through the build up.</li>
            <li>It will not take a years worth of roughness off quickly.</li>
            <li>Mine went right in the trash.</li>
            <li>Once you get down to fresh, clear skin then using Pedispin regularly will make subsiquent use easier &amp; more effective.</li>
            <li>It really dont work at all</li>
            <li>Late arrival a little but excellent product</li>
            <li>I like is better because it gets all your dead skin off</li>
            <li>I wish it was a slightly different shape to get into the cracks of my fingers, but all in all quite useful.</li>
            <li>Barely works.</li>
            <li>When first contacted with the foot, I applied to much pressure and the tool would slow.  </li>

            <li> Still haven&#x27;t figured out what this suppose to actually do because it does nothing. I have used the pedegg before but this pedi spin is a waist of time &amp; money. It doesn&#x27;t remove any dead skin and if you use the buffer pad it stops a soon as you put it up to your feet</li>
            <li> gave this item to my daughter she likes it.</li>
            <li> It really dont work at all</li>
            <li> I like is better because it gets all your dead skin off, it took me 3x because of all the dead skin I had.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t  remove my callus&#x27;s at all and stops if you press at all. if i don&#x27;t press it spins but doesn&#x27;t remove anything. same product but i bought at another store.</li>
            <li> Barely works. Couldn&#x27;t expect more for the price.</li>
            <li> This product does not even deserve one star. Awful product. Mine went right in the trash. Does not work well at all. What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> works well.  shipped slow.  I wish it was a slightly different shape to get into the cracks of my fingers, but all in all quite useful.</li>

            <li> This tool arrived faster than anticipated.  When first contacted with the foot, I applied to much pressure and the tool would slow.  I pulled back and continued the process.  To my surprise, My foot felt very smooth.  This is a great buy for the money.</li>
