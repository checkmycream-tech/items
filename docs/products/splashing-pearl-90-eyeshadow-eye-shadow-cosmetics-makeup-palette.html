            <li>When I run out of these beautiful colors, I will definitely be repurchasing.</li>
            <li>, I have already tried on a couple of colors,and they went on smooth.</li>
            <li>But it was easy to clean up.</li>
            <li>I liked  too much thx</li>
            <li>I ordered this item one for my daughter and one for myself we love it very much.</li>
            <li>tried some on and it stayed on me the whole entire day, it went on very smoothly and also is great to blend!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the colors are real pretty</li>
            <li>I was excited to get this.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a full shimmer palette w/all the primary colors in it</li>
            <li>I was so excited for my eyeshadow pallete</li>
            <li>im so happy even though it took so long but its worth it</li>
            <li>the colors are really nice and so far out of all that I have ordered in the eye shadow palettes</li>
            <li>/&gt;Check out the video to see the full review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than that, the colors are great</li>
            <li>It stays on all day especially if you use primer, it is bold and noticeable, looks very smooth and blends fantastic.</li>
            <li>I have so much fun using them.</li>
            <li>It was very much worth getting</li>
            <li>I have so my palettes that were not cheap but this Splashing Pearl 90 eyeshadow is by far the best one I have purchased!</li>
            <li>Along with the bright colors, are other more natural colors that work well with contouring.</li>
            <li>It came very fast, it was wrapped up in bubble wrap</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a make up fanatic and these colors are great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s most definitely a steal.</li>
            <li>Thanks for taking the time to read my review!</li>
            <li>The colors are absolutely beautiful, blend easily and definitely are long lasting.</li>
            <li>and it was packaged better nothing cracked or missing thank you for taking care of it very quickly</li>
            <li>Very nice colors, long lasting.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the colors are very pigmented, even more so than my sephora palette that i had gotten as a xmas gift last yr.</li>
            <li>I was under no obligation to post a review or give positive feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but other than that, great starting eye shadow</li>
            <li>Came wrapped very nice and was clean and not one palette was broken into pieces, i was surprised!</li>
            <li>glttery pearl is not as strong but it works out by putting it over the regular eyeshadow.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the spring in the back of the eyeshadow kit itself was broke and I had to put hot clue on it in order to have it look like new other than that it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>My only concern with this eyeshadow kit would be the wrapping it Needs to be tissue lots of tissue put inside of the box than maybe the shadows won&#x27;t get damaged mine were fine but</li>
            <li>I am very accordant with purchase</li>
            <li>hahaha</li>
            <li>Looking forward to ordering another palette really soon.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>No broken eye shadows either</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this palette!</li>
            <li>and it isn&#x27;t really even a problem, more so just kind of weird.</li>
            <li>colors are bold and last allllllll day !</li>
            <li>It was clearly banged, cracking the plastic&#x27;s whole rear end of the case.</li>
            <li>Beginner makeup artists&#x27; play ground of fun colors to experiment using different blends.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a total fail, however, it would be nice if they found a better way to ship it so they weren&#x27;t cracked when they arrive.  </li>
            <li>I know a lot of people have sensitive noses and tend to stay away from fragranced makeup and if ur one of them I don&#x27;t suggest this pallete for u.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this Monday night and was surprised when it came in today</li>
            <li>I try to provide you with simple reviews that get straight to the point without a lot of jargon or repeating the product description.</li>
            <li>was so surprised and happy!!&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li>I paid 6 dollars for shipping and handling expecting my item to come completely UNDAMAGED.</li>
            <li>The packaging from the usps was fine but the item sent was broken, the eyeshadow were missing in most places.</li>
            <li>i definitely recommend to buyers looking for long lasting and bold colors</li>
            <li>I want my money back or a new tablet.</li>
            <li>to top it off I received 2 little cases of glittery pearl eyeshadow, glittery eye liner and 2 eyehsadow primers!!!</li>
            <li>Even the eye shadow applicators are 2 sided and you get six so its actually like 24 applicators that surprised me</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but it stayed on all day ^_^</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve never encountered eyeshadow or any makeup for that matter that has a particular scent but this one definitely smells, and a bit strange at that.</li>

            <li> It came pretty quickly but was dissapointed to open it rigjt away and have an eyeshadow broken and a few were damaged/chunky.</li>
            <li> These colors are vibrant with a little bit of shimmer.</li>
            <li> The only thing i found was different was how long it lasted.</li>
            <li> They last very long, yesterday I put it on around 2:30 and got home around midnight</li>
            <li> a base my shadow will last a good 4-6 hrs before the color starts to fade.</li>
            <li> I personally used other brushes while applying this product, the the sponges that come with the product will work as well.</li>
            <li> Only one color had come apart a little bit but still way usable.</li>
            <li> And The reason I gave a 3 is because one of the colors had broke and spilled all over the other colors.</li>
            <li> Also love that they wear all day, when used with an eye primer or eye shadow base.  </li>
            <li> We were not able to use some of the colors due to the breakage being so severe the square was almost completely empty and the lighter colors were stained.</li>
            <li> was a little hard to get it open though</li>
            <li> a little bc it was so tightly taped.</li>
            <li> Just had to wipe the case off a little.</li>
            <li> in a few days of ordering it.</li>
            <li> and w/o a base and the results are exactly the same for me at least.</li>
            <li> Ill give u my personal pros &amp; cons from experience</li>
            <li> They just fade away after what seems like a couple of hours :/</li>
            <li> Pure disappointment!</li>
            <li> The pieces of the broken ones merged into other colors making it hard to remove the cracked pieces which ended up dis-coloring some of the shadows.  </li>
            <li> The palette is made of a hard plastic that holds the trays well (no wiggle room in there)</li>
            <li> I have nothing negative to say about this product</li>
            <li> /&gt;The palette itself was packaged well, no scratches or broken shadows.</li>
            <li> It was here in a timely fashion, and none of the eye shadows weren&#x27;t broken.</li>
            <li> When it arrived (quite promptly) there were shadows that were cracked and broken all together.  </li>
            <li> so nothing was broken.</li>
            <li> im sorry if that wasn&#x27;t helpful at all</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry if you order this trust me</li>
            <li> Purchased one it was horrible all broke left message and they resent me one</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t an awful smell, its a little weird to describem</li>
            <li> but this product came Damaged. :-(</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-no base needed</li>
            <li> W/a base</li>

            <li> I am very accordant with purchase</li>
            <li> I just wanted to say that this palette exceeds my expectations! &amp; i absolutely love it! Ill give u my personal pros &amp; cons from experience&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-extremely pigmented&lt;br /&gt;-long lasting&lt;br /&gt;-no base needed&lt;br /&gt;-easily blended&lt;br /&gt;The palette itself was packaged well, no scratches or broken shadows. I actually had to fight with the bubblewrap a little bc it was so tightly taped. It arrived 2 days after placing my order&lt;br /&gt;Lol&lt;br /&gt;the colors are very pigmented, even more so than my sephora palette that i had gotten as a xmas gift last yr. The colors are absolutely beautiful, blend easily and definitely are long lasting. I tried using this palette w/and w/o a base and the results are exactly the same for me at least. The only thing i found was different was how long it lasted. W/a base itll wear like iron and be flawless. W/o a base my shadow will last a good 4-6 hrs before the color starts to fade. Take note it will not be the same for everyone. Im a latina, w/an olive tone and i was just astonished at how well the colors stand out, like i mentioned before it put my sephora palette to shame now on with the cons.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-smell&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I&#x27;ve encountered with this palette and it isn&#x27;t really even a problem, more so just kind of weird. I know a lot of people have sensitive noses and tend to stay away from fragranced makeup and if ur one of them I don&#x27;t suggest this pallete for u. It isn&#x27;t an awful smell, its a little weird to describem I would say its a cross between floral and grandma scent LOL im sorry if that wasn&#x27;t helpful at all hahaha but that&#x27;s really the best I can describe it, I&#x27;ve never encountered eyeshadow or any makeup for that matter that has a particular scent but this one definitely smells, and a bit strange at that.</li>
            <li> Wow.  No damage, beautiful colors.  Beginner makeup artists&#x27; play ground of fun colors to experiment using different blends.</li>
            <li> I m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Love the colors but this product came Damaged. :-(</li>
            <li> I ordered this Monday night and was surprised when it came in today I couldn&#x27;t wait to open it... And when I did I was happy I ordered it the colors are really nice and so far out of all that I have ordered in the eye shadow palettes this is my favorite the colors are real pretty and you can do a lot with what they have in the kit and I used the purple today I put it on at 2:30 and it is I:30 in the morning and it is still on my eyes.... You won&#x27;t be sorry if you order this trust me I&#x27;m a make up fanatic and these colors are great they shimmer just enough, and I can&#x27;t wait to do my eyes again in the morning.... Excellent Eye Palette....Even the eye shadow applicators are 2 sided and you get six so its actually like 24 applicators that surprised me you always get 2 applicators and the mirror on it is big... Great buy for 20.00</li>
            <li> Very bright vivid colors that I was able to apply very easily. None were cracked, which I&#x27;m very happy with, and it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I order this palette for xmas gift&#x27;s for my mom, sister, and best friend, and one for myself. I really love it, I have already tried on a couple of colors,and they went on smooth. It was here in a timely fashion, and none of the eye shadows weren&#x27;t broken. Looking forward to ordering another palette really soon.</li>
            <li> I really love these colors and wear. I have so much fun using them. I am going to tell my friends.</li>
            <li> Ordered this eyeshadow kit with great expectations...not so much.  When it arrived (quite promptly) there were shadows that were cracked and broken all together.  The pieces of the broken ones merged into other colors making it hard to remove the cracked pieces which ended up dis-coloring some of the shadows.  The makeup goes on well but does not stay on all day and requires re-applications.  It isn&#x27;t a total fail, however, it would be nice if they found a better way to ship it so they weren&#x27;t cracked when they arrive.  We were not able to use some of the colors due to the breakage being so severe the square was almost completely empty and the lighter colors were stained.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased. I have no complaints. Thanks. I will be shopping with you again in the future. Thanks.</li>
            <li> fabulous product! i love the color, the sparkle/shimmer, and nothing was broken! the colors are great and are very vibrant. i am very happy with the product and would 100% recommend to others!</li>
            <li> Excellent colors nice on the skin you will feel beautiful like a model I Love It..It was very much worth getting</li>
            <li> Very nice colors, long lasting. Very good quality.</li>
            <li> i have not used this yet but the colors are amazing. cant wait to try it out! Came wrapped very nice and was clean and not one palette was broken into pieces, i was surprised! Awesome deal!</li>
            <li> The colors in this pallet are beautiful and shimmering. Good quality eye shadow, with or with-out primer. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> great kit, was package very nicely.  No broken eye shadows either, so I was very happy with the purchase.  was a little hard to get it open though but no a problem</li>
            <li> I have so my palettes that were not cheap but this Splashing Pearl 90 eyeshadow is by far the best one I have purchased! OMG for the price of $9.95 you get a wonderful selection of beautiful colors that are so pigmented and long lasting, I just could not believe it. I highly recommend this palette!</li>
            <li> amazing, beautiful, i think is the best purchase ever..</li>
            <li> I just received it this morning. The packaging from the usps was fine but the item sent was broken, the eyeshadow were missing in most places. It was covered with eyeshadow that had spilled from the inside and the plastic that comes around it was falling off. Pure disappointment! The only plus is that it came in 3days instead of a week like Amazon had predicted.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item one for my daughter and one for myself we love it very much. It&#x27;s not a 100 colors but it is 90 and that&#x27;s okay they are beautiful. There&#x27;s still a lot of colors to choose from and I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> i love it! the colors are amazing! im so happy even though it took so long but its worth it</li>
            <li> This is the best eye shadow I have ever had. It fully exceeded my expectations. It stays on all day especially if you use primer, it is bold and noticeable, looks very smooth and blends fantastic. I have nothing negative to say about this product</li>
            <li> Purchased one it was horrible all broke left message and they resent me one and it was packaged better nothing cracked or missing thank you for taking care of it very quickly</li>
            <li> These colors are vibrant with a little bit of shimmer. Can be worn out with almost any look as the shimmer isn&#x27;t overpowering. I have had this palette for two years and have not yet run out of any one color. The palette is made of a hard plastic that holds the trays well (no wiggle room in there) so you can take this with you as you travel. Along with the bright colors, are other more natural colors that work well with contouring. The colors apply well, and you do not have to apply a lot to get the bright colors on. I personally used other brushes while applying this product, the the sponges that come with the product will work as well. When I run out of these beautiful colors, I will definitely be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Love all of the color options.  Love the satin like texture of the eye shadows.  Also love that they wear all day, when used with an eye primer or eye shadow base.  No complaints.  I am satisfied with my decision to try this product.</li>
            <li> Really good variety of colors! They just fade away after what seems like a couple of hours :/ but other than that, great starting eye shadow</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this. Worried about the eyeshadow being busted from being delivered, knowing eyeshadow easily breaks. Only one color had come apart a little bit but still way usable. Just had to wipe the case off a little. Other than that, the colors are great and I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but it stayed on all day ^_^</li>
            <li> I gave this Amuse brand palette 5 stars because of the quality of the eyeshadow and the number of colors for the price. It&#x27;s most definitely a steal. If you had any reservations, don&#x27;t. I was looking for a full shimmer palette w/all the primary colors in it and this has them all. The bonus for me was the warm earth tones, as well as the smokey eye colors. I won&#x27;t buy another palette since I&#x27;ve found what I was looking for. The shipping was prompt, I received it w/in a few days of ordering it. All shadows were in tact and it was packaged well enough to get from Cali to Jersey. The best $20 you&#x27;ll spend in eyeshadow by far!</li>
            <li> i bought this for my sister and i hope it will bring good results. it&#x27;s coming through the mail so i&#x27;m just waiting to try it out.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the colors an the shimmer. I had the eyeshadow on my eyes for 9 hrs an didnt heave to reapply at all. But I did put a primer on also.  But they got a lot of the colors I&#x27;ve been looking for. And The reason I gave a 3 is because one of the colors had broke and spilled all over the other colors. But it was easy to clean up. An it arrived way ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:f260ad44b8237f784f7340137d4f29cb]] Awesome color palette for theatre make-up, photo shoots or crafting!!

            <li> My only concern with this eyeshadow kit would be the wrapping it Needs to be tissue lots of tissue put inside of the box than maybe the shadows won&#x27;t get damaged mine were fine but the spring in the back of the eyeshadow kit itself was broke and I had to put hot clue on it in order to have it look like new other than that it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> I love the colors. It goes on just as I was expecting it to</li>
            <li> It came pretty quickly but was dissapointed to open it rigjt away and have an eyeshadow broken and a few were damaged/chunky. However the colors are beautiful and vibrant. I use this almost every day. Very nice though and might buy again.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST THING I HAVE EVER BOUGHT FOR MY SELF ITS A MUST BUY!!! THE COLORS ARE AMAZING AND STAY ON YOUR EYE I USED THIS FOR MY MARINE CORP BALL AND I WAS TOLD BY MANY PEOPLE AND FELLOW MARINES I WAS BEAUTIFUL</li>
            <li> colors are bold and last allllllll day ! i definitely recommend to buyers looking for long lasting and bold colors</li>
            <li> I was so excited for my eyeshadow pallete and I find it spilled all over mixing almost all of the colors together! If I could I wouldn&#x27;t give it any stars! If you chooseto buy it you do at your own risk!!</li>
            <li> This eyeshadow palette came in the mail in 4 days!&lt;br /&gt;I tried some on and it stayed on me the whole entire day, it went on very smoothly and also is great to blend!&lt;br /&gt;I would soooo recommend!! :)&lt;br /&gt;and to top it off I received 2 little cases of glittery pearl eyeshadow, glittery eye liner and 2 eyehsadow primers!!! for FREE!!&lt;br /&gt;I was so surprised and happy!!&lt;br /&gt;the glttery pearl is not as strong but it works out by putting it over the regular eyeshadow.&lt;br /&gt;I Loved this package!!&lt;br /&gt;cant wait to order again</li>
            <li> I paid 6 dollars for shipping and handling expecting my item to come completely UNDAMAGED. It was clearly banged, cracking the plastic&#x27;s whole rear end of the case. The plastic even fell out and of course some of the shadows got damaged too. I want my money back or a new tablet.</li>
            <li> I liked  too much thx</li>
            <li> It came very fast, it was wrapped up in bubble wrap so nothing was broken. All the colors are just like how they are in the pictures, absolutely amazing! They look absolutely amazing when you put them on too!! They last very long, yesterday I put it on around 2:30 and got home around midnight and it was still perfect, the only reason I had to take it off was to go to bed. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my eyeshadow! Definitely will be buying from this seller again! Love it!!!!</li>
