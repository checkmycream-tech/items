            <li>Great buy.</li>
            <li>Conair has great products producing great results.</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my husband, but he says it is great, working well.</li>
            <li>That way the gel/lather comes out very warm.</li>
            <li>Nice product!</li>
            <li>He still hasn&#x27;t figured out how to assemble it successfully but has used up 2 cans of shaving cream trying.</li>
            <li>This product is probably a good one.</li>
            <li>Not as good quality as the ones the barber uses.  </li>
            <li>I thought this would be a good replacement - NOT.</li>
            <li>I have nothing good to say about it.</li>
            <li>My son loved getting this for xmas</li>
            <li>I got two for gifts and they loved them.</li>
            <li>and he loved it.</li>
            <li>I lost a good bit of gel.  </li>
            <li>Good for the Price</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s especially loving it on these cool mornings.</li>
            <li>Shaving with this device is very enjoyable.</li>
            <li>My husband is very pleased.</li>
            <li>and I know he&#x27;ll love this Christams gift!</li>
            <li>and it was exactly what he wanted and does an excellent job.</li>
            <li>For the price you get what you pay for and more!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased it for him!</li>
            <li>Fortunately, this makes it more pleasant!  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found one yet that will give you nice warm shaving cream.</li>
            <li>the gel/lather comes out quite warm.</li>
            <li>NICE SHAVIN</li>
            <li>But it is fairly warm.</li>
            <li>Nice thought</li>
            <li>It turns off every hour which can be nice for being at home.</li>
            <li>It is nice.  </li>
            <li>My husband loves his warm shave.  </li>
            <li>I retired mine as it is easier to distribute the warm foam on the face.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if the lather got a lil warmer, but heyy it works.</li>
            <li>This one is just barely warm.</li>
            <li>Nice to see separate settings for foam and gel.</li>
            <li>Recommended purchase, cost effective</li>
            <li>It is slightly warm when coming out, but before you can apply it -- it is room temperature.  </li>
            <li>(I haven&#x27;t used it for gel) to a nice temperature for shaving.  </li>
            <li>I think it would&#x27;ve been nice.  </li>
            <li>GIVES A WARM SHAVE.</li>
            <li>Every man should own one, holds any size can.</li>
            <li>heats to luke warm</li>
            <li>Dispenser is not even warm.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price!!!</li>
            <li>Great for the winter time, doesn&#x27;t get that hot, but it does the trick!</li>
            <li>It heats up your shaving cream so it feels nice and warm on your face making it more enjoyable to shave your face</li>
            <li>It heats the shaving cream up to a warm lather and nothing more.</li>
            <li>I love the warm shave cream in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Great gift husband loved his new one...</li>
            <li>Easy to set up, and to use, the wife even uses it!</li>
            <li>He especially likes how he can use any kind of shaving gel and it works perfectly!</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful idea but a piece of junk that has major design flaws.  </li>
            <li>It does the job fine with a warm lather and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>was great at first, but after about two months it stopped working</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this thing.  </li>
            <li>I have been getting better and closer</li>
            <li>This is an outstanding product.</li>
            <li>I am most pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li>I looked for a better quality one on the internet but didn&#x27;t have any luck.  </li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>top push button seems to get stuck or doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>leaked from the top.  </li>
            <li>Just what he wanted and he is extremely pleased with it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s always better.</li>
            <li>It is a shaving cream dispenser and does dispense shaving cream.:)</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much more for it to do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping that I can find a better cream to use.</li>
            <li>it ok</li>
            <li>I also love that you can use any shaving cream with it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>It was ok, nothing to brag about.</li>
            <li>For the price that is OK.</li>
            <li>Buy it:)</li>
            <li>Instead of heating his shave cream in the microwave, this product makes it better.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t use for a week better to detach shaving canister</li>
            <li>No matter how many times I re-seat the can, it is hit or miss getting the shaving cream out.  </li>
            <li>Upped to 3 stars as it is working much better</li>
            <li>My wife bought this for me last Christmas, and it worked wonderfully for about 6 months.  </li>
            <li>Works quite well, shaving cream is perfect, not too hot, just right, would recommend this product to other people, excellent buy</li>
            <li>A pretty good performer for the money.</li>
            <li>Takes good 3-5 mins before you&#x27;ll feel the hot shave.</li>
            <li>It does take some time to heat up but does get the shaving cream good and hot.</li>
            <li>Warms up quickly with a nice temperature.</li>
            <li>The foam is mostly air, and it easily gives up it heat (heat transfer) to the surrounding ambient air.  </li>
            <li>Very nice and stylish design, setup was pretty easy, and heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li>Very cool.</li>
            <li>Very good heated later or gel if you want it..</li>
            <li>It makes the shave more comfortable than before.</li>
            <li>So far, both are working great.  </li>
            <li>It heats in three minutes to a perfectly comfortable temperature and can be used with most canisters.</li>
            <li>The foam comes out rich and warm to give you the special shave.</li>
            <li>The goal is to provide warm foam to the face to loosen whiskers better than ambient temperature foam, and this certainly does the job.  </li>
            <li>You made it soo easy to find and purchase</li>
            <li>It makes it easy to get the cream out</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easily changed out for what ever the customer likes.</li>
            <li>So easy to use.</li>
            <li>All of the controls are easy to use and operate as adverstised.  </li>
            <li>My old lather worked good for many years till it quit.</li>
            <li>HUSBAND LIKED THIS HOT LATHER MACHINE.</li>
            <li>I liked the hot gel idea.</li>
            <li>Warms up nicely but not too hot.</li>
            <li>Warm but no longer hot after a year</li>
            <li>You will not get hot lather with this unit, but it will be warm.  </li>
            <li>It works better on a full can.  </li>
            <li>Great work item received quickly and as advertised, like new.</li>
            <li>Heats fine in about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>It dispenses the lather fine</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly!</li>
            <li>Once I got it and opened the box, I realized how cheap it was and that it wouldn&#x27;t be what he was looking for.  </li>
            <li>It lets you really enjoy your shave.</li>
            <li>I have to shave everyday for work and this thing is great!    </li>
            <li>Carriers dropping packages off without signatures is such a great idea</li>
            <li>I purchased the item for my husband and he seems to enjoy it.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews but could not believe them since mine has been such a great product.</li>
            <li>It is actually attractive enough to keep on the vanity as a tool and a decor.  </li>
            <li>Truly does what it says...produces warm lather, which my husband really likes about it.  </li>
            <li>Nice on sensitive skin uses the cheap shaving cream too!</li>
            <li>SO far so good, this one is working well.</li>
            <li>The foam is warm enough but not quite as warm as I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li>was exactly as advertised!!</li>
            <li>The new one looks impressive but it does not heat up the shaving cream above room temperature.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE HOT MACHINE.</li>
            <li>My favorite part of a haircut is the hot shave.  </li>
            <li>I now shave each day with hot gel, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>But he was excited about it, so we attempted to try it.  </li>
            <li>It came and my husband was so excited.</li>
            <li>It works well when the can is new, kind of so</li>
            <li>NO INSTRUCTIONS, HOWEVER, OF HOW TO PROPERLY &#x27;CLEAN&#x27; THIS MACHINE.  </li>
            <li>Poor to say the best does not get hot barely warm.</li>
            <li>A little warmer would be ideal.</li>
            <li>Over all it works very well and the onle thing I would change is to be able to set the temp.</li>
            <li>Wish gel would be hotter but overall its good</li>
            <li>The only product I have bought on amazon that I have nothing good to say about.</li>
            <li>Seemed pretty easy to put together and use.</li>
            <li>first, it&#x27;s not that easy to set up.  </li>
            <li>Nice and hot and heats up pretty fast!</li>
            <li>but I wish the foam heated up quickly.</li>
            <li>I know some folks have had these work well for them, but from reading many, many reviews it appears that buying one of these Conair devices is an enormous crap-shoot...</li>
            <li>This new unit is better as it shuts off automatically if you forget to turn it off.  </li>
            <li>Nothing like a hot shave!</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s the little things in life that makes one happy</li>
            <li>Only time will tell if these will hold on strong, but, for right now, I&#x27;m satisfied with them.    </li>
            <li>I had a nearly identical unit for many years which broke.</li>
            <li>This product is well worth the money for the function it provides.  </li>
            <li>A nice present i suppose.</li>
            <li>He is pleased with it because it works like his old Conair dispenser.</li>
            <li>Mine heats up instantly and the warm cream helps to soften my whiskers.</li>
            <li>He reports this unit does warm the shave cream in a regular can but not to what he was expecting.  </li>
            <li>IT IS WORTH PURCHASING.  </li>
            <li>It gives only modestly warm lather from gel of foam.</li>
            <li>Cap heater lasted 8 months before blowing out, but worth $39.</li>
            <li>But when it is warm enough, it is too runny.</li>
            <li>Still quite hot, but would be nice if you had a little more leeway there.      </li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t even feel good about trying to sell it at my garage sale the other day.  </li>
            <li>ALTHOUGH THE LATHER STARTS TO COME OUT RIGHT AWAY</li>
            <li>right with gel or</li>
            <li>I know I&#x27;m doing it right.</li>
            <li>Nice to have hot shaving cream, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li>It is a very good looking little machine and all commercial shaving cream cans fit.</li>
            <li>While function seems to be OK, even on the highest temp setting the lather is barely lukewarm when dispensed and by the time you apply it to your face</li>
            <li>Worked fine until it fell apart after only six months of light usage.  </li>
            <li>The large circle in top is in essence a button, and that is just staying completely depressed now, somewhere along the line it wore out and</li>
            <li>That seemed to be inevitable, but, luckily, they&#x27;re cheap and effective enough to justify having to repurchase every couple of years or so.      </li>
            <li>there is nothing wrong with a good warm shave</li>
            <li>I followed all the instructions, gave it plenty of time to warm up, and it comes out just barely warmer than it would have otherwise been at normal room temperature.  </li>
            <li>works great, only problem takes too long to warm up and could get cream a little warmer, but really enjoy it</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t seem to heat the lather very much.</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>YOUR LEGGS WITH HOT LEATHER.</li>
            <li>I wanted to have a hot shaving lather - this item provides a tepid lather, and does not produce a lather, but a product from a can of lather.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat a hot, barber shop style shave every morning</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get as hot as needed.</li>
            <li>control higher.</li>
            <li>Do not expect a hot lather, you won&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li>They said they did not manufacture this unit any more and that I was to find a unit similar and let them know.  </li>
            <li>HGL11 Combo Hot Gel/Lather Machine w/Chrome Finish.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe this \\&quot;chrome appearance\\&quot; justifies the higher price.</li>
            <li>This one is even better than the last one.</li>
            <li>Not as hot as I had hoped for.</li>
            <li>but it was hot.</li>
            <li>The shaving cream was that hot.</li>
            <li>Item was exactly as described in ad.</li>
            <li>Hot -- it is NOT.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy if you think you are going to have a \\&quot;hot lather</li>
            <li>to get his favorite shave \\&quot;cream\\&quot; (gel) can to mate up properly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not looking for hot ( burning) but  </li>
            <li>Hot shaving leather.</li>
            <li>The warm shaving cream really makes the daily chore so much easier.</li>
            <li>dispenses warm shaving cream, not up to what I expected.</li>
            <li>I have owned the previous cheap, plastic looking conair shaving dispenser which worked much better than this one.  </li>
            <li>The lather is comfortably warm, but not hot.</li>
            <li>Not hot but luke warm.</li>
            <li>A more viscous fluid would hold the heat longer, but then this isn&#x27;t really the goal.  </li>
            <li>First, don&#x27;t try using the large gel containers, doesn&#x27;t work well at all.</li>
            <li>DO NOT BELIEVE THESE POSITIVE REVIEWS.</li>
            <li>Then I put a can of foam on and it came out hot but very runny.</li>
            <li>He uses it everyday with no issues and loves the nice warm lather it makes from his regular old can of shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I was able to get a single luke-warm shave out of this product before it quit working (wouldn&#x27;t put gel into the warming chamber).  </li>
            <li>I subsequently purchase another unit and it is still working just fine.</li>
            <li>I tried switching it to gel (I used the gel attachment) and that seemed to work fine, however the entire heating assembly (the top) is not very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>The warm lather is very welcome especially in cold winters.</li>
            <li>I had the bright idea of not listening to the negative reviews on this product and bought 2 of these.  </li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t shut off and run a whole can of gel all over everything on my sink before I could get the can unhooked.</li>
            <li>My husband really enjoys using this machine.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t heat up as much as I would like either.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my brother who is a barber and he absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>too much counter space and maintenance to keep it flowing.</li>
            <li>Also, the heating of the cream takes much longer than the 3 minutes the instructions claim.  </li>
            <li>but I got too busy and it wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle.</li>
            <li>He really seemed to&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast delivery too.</li>
            <li>Really wish I had read the reviews before purchasing mine.  </li>
            <li>He really likes it when it works-</li>
            <li>comes out only slightly warm and turns heat off after very short time.</li>
            <li>If the new one lasts as long as the prior version, at $45, it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
            <li>can at the neck, it doesn&#x27;t do a good job of heating the moderate amount of cream the average guy uses when he shaves his face.  </li>
            <li>Does the job adequately, dispense flow is a bit slow, seems more sturdy than older models.  </li>
            <li>More importantly, the machine only moderately heats up the lather - and takes a long time to do THAT</li>
            <li>I have used Conair hot lather machines in past years and was quite pleased with them; not so concerning this model,</li>
            <li>When it locks in, works decent.</li>
            <li>Cleaning the adapter and main unit didn&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this dispenser.</li>
            <li>My only comment would be that it gets the lather warm, but not hot.  </li>
            <li>adjustable heat and cleaner looks with much improved design compared to my old unit,  reaches temperature setting a lot faster</li>
            <li>Gels are dispensed slowly and barely warm.</li>
            <li>-so when it is half full, then pretty crummy as the can gets lower.  </li>
            <li>My husband had a very simple and easy to use dispenser that finally died.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like about them is that, even at max setting, they don&#x27;t get quite as hot as the older models did.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in barber school and this product makes my station look a little more professional at non-professional price.</li>
            <li>Put a new can in the night before.</li>
            <li>Works easier when the unit is new</li>
            <li>The new one did not heat the lather the way it should..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a long-time Conair Hot Lather Machine user going back 10 years or so.  </li>
            <li>wish there was one to actually give you hot lather.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get the lather hot enough</li>
            <li>I would agree with other reviews that the initial foam is hot and that after the first pump, the remainder isn&#x27;t nearly as hot as it should be.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li>DOES&#x27;NT GET HOT ENOUGH FOR ME.IT&#x27;LL</li>
            <li>This is the third Conair hot lathering machine I have purchased as gifts for my Dad-</li>
            <li>But, it is also small and light enough for quick storage if you choose.</li>
            <li>Feels great on those cold mornings.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t warm very well, ridiculously difficult to insert can, spills gel and cream everywhere while trying to insert</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care how much you spend they all work the same way, save your money.</li>
            <li>and this is really the only practical way of doing it yourself at home.  </li>
            <li>While I shave with an old style blade, you could use any razor.</li>
            <li>but it dont stay hot long</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a month so far.</li>
            <li>It warms the shaving cream faster than the old one did</li>
            <li>My husband has wanted one of these for a couple of years and the choices are:  this level or the professional level.  </li>
            <li>He uses the gel shaving cream and loves the warmth when he shaves in the early mornings in winter.</li>
            <li>His old one ( 10 yrs old) had gone out and he was upset that we could not find one in our home town, then I thought of the internet .</li>
            <li>It was a replacement for an old one that died.</li>
            <li>He was so surprised when he opened it up and saw what it was that I will remember the look on his face forever.  </li>
            <li>So far he is &amp;</li>
            <li>Wow what a concept.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s room temperature--the same it would be straight out of a can.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on this item; most are made by the same manufacturer.</li>
            <li>Extremely frustrating early in the morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since changing the can from Aloe to regular shaving cream, seems to be working much more consistent.  </li>
            <li>I would go for a more expensive mode; that automatically shuts-off when it gets too hot.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting a better quality the price little high it can be less</li>
            <li>The Heated Shaving Cream dispenser was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>This first can is one I had on-hand when the device arrived, and YES it get&#x27;s hot but the cream is no longer thick from the can</li>
            <li>it realy does not really heat the shaving jel very well.</li>
            <li>It is not the same quality sa my old one.</li>
            <li>Purchased to replace a similar model that lasted nearly  3 years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a Conair lather warmer for years which finally died of old age.  </li>
            <li>purchased for my father for christmas his old one took a dive last him</li>
            <li>This is my husband&#x27;s second Conair heated shaving cream dispenser, the first one stopped working suddenly after daily use for several years.</li>
            <li>Only takes one can size my old one took two can sizes.  </li>
            <li>When all is said in done, it is a nice looking heated shaving cream dispenser that fails to heat the shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>The temperature of the shaving cream is unpredictable - sometimes barely warm and on the other extreme, I heard an &amp;#34;Ouch!&amp;#34; coming from the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>First, chrome is a metal; this device is made of plastic, just as the black colored model is.</li>
            <li>The old models I&#x27;m used to using are long discontinued now, so I went ahead and purchased two of these newer models.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts - 6 months so far.</li>
            <li>Previous Conair dispensers I had earlier were much hotter.&lt;br /&gt;Hard</li>
            <li>Too much waiting time, with too little results.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Conair has great products producing great results.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband, but he says it is great, working well.</li>
            <li> That way the gel/lather comes out very warm.</li>
            <li> Nice product!</li>
            <li> He still hasn&#x27;t figured out how to assemble it successfully but has used up 2 cans of shaving cream trying.</li>
            <li> This product is probably a good one.</li>
            <li> Not as good quality as the ones the barber uses.  </li>
            <li> I thought this would be a good replacement - NOT.</li>
            <li> I have nothing good to say about it.</li>
            <li> My son loved getting this for xmas</li>
            <li> I got two for gifts and they loved them.</li>
            <li> and he loved it.</li>
            <li> I lost a good bit of gel.  </li>
            <li> Good for the Price</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s especially loving it on these cool mornings.</li>
            <li> Shaving with this device is very enjoyable.</li>
            <li> My husband is very pleased.</li>
            <li> and I know he&#x27;ll love this Christams gift!</li>
            <li> and it was exactly what he wanted and does an excellent job.</li>
            <li> For the price you get what you pay for and more!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased it for him!</li>
            <li> Fortunately, this makes it more pleasant!  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found one yet that will give you nice warm shaving cream.</li>
            <li> the gel/lather comes out quite warm.</li>
            <li> NICE SHAVIN</li>
            <li> But it is fairly warm.</li>
            <li> Nice thought</li>
            <li> It turns off every hour which can be nice for being at home.</li>
            <li> It is nice.  </li>
            <li> My husband loves his warm shave.  </li>
            <li> I retired mine as it is easier to distribute the warm foam on the face.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if the lather got a lil warmer, but heyy it works.</li>
            <li> This one is just barely warm.</li>
            <li> Nice to see separate settings for foam and gel.</li>
            <li> Recommended purchase, cost effective</li>
            <li> It is slightly warm when coming out, but before you can apply it -- it is room temperature.  </li>
            <li> (I haven&#x27;t used it for gel) to a nice temperature for shaving.  </li>
            <li> I think it would&#x27;ve been nice.  </li>
            <li> GIVES A WARM SHAVE.</li>
            <li> Every man should own one, holds any size can.</li>
            <li> heats to luke warm</li>
            <li> Dispenser is not even warm.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price!!!</li>
            <li> Great for the winter time, doesn&#x27;t get that hot, but it does the trick!</li>
            <li> It heats up your shaving cream so it feels nice and warm on your face making it more enjoyable to shave your face</li>
            <li> It heats the shaving cream up to a warm lather and nothing more.</li>
            <li> I love the warm shave cream in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Great gift husband loved his new one...</li>
            <li> Easy to set up, and to use, the wife even uses it!</li>
            <li> He especially likes how he can use any kind of shaving gel and it works perfectly!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful idea but a piece of junk that has major design flaws.  </li>
            <li> It does the job fine with a warm lather and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> was great at first, but after about two months it stopped working</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this thing.  </li>
            <li> I have been getting better and closer</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding product.</li>
            <li> I am most pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li> I looked for a better quality one on the internet but didn&#x27;t have any luck.  </li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> top push button seems to get stuck or doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> leaked from the top.  </li>
            <li> Just what he wanted and he is extremely pleased with it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s always better.</li>
            <li> It is a shaving cream dispenser and does dispense shaving cream.:)</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much more for it to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that I can find a better cream to use.</li>
            <li> it ok</li>
            <li> I also love that you can use any shaving cream with it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> It was ok, nothing to brag about.</li>
            <li> For the price that is OK.</li>
            <li> Buy it:)</li>
            <li> Instead of heating his shave cream in the microwave, this product makes it better.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use for a week better to detach shaving canister</li>
            <li> No matter how many times I re-seat the can, it is hit or miss getting the shaving cream out.  </li>
            <li> Upped to 3 stars as it is working much better</li>
            <li> My wife bought this for me last Christmas, and it worked wonderfully for about 6 months.  </li>
            <li> Works quite well, shaving cream is perfect, not too hot, just right, would recommend this product to other people, excellent buy</li>
            <li> A pretty good performer for the money.</li>
            <li> Takes good 3-5 mins before you&#x27;ll feel the hot shave.</li>
            <li> It does take some time to heat up but does get the shaving cream good and hot.</li>
            <li> Warms up quickly with a nice temperature.</li>
            <li> The foam is mostly air, and it easily gives up it heat (heat transfer) to the surrounding ambient air.  </li>
            <li> Very nice and stylish design, setup was pretty easy, and heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li> Very cool.</li>
            <li> Very good heated later or gel if you want it..</li>
            <li> It makes the shave more comfortable than before.</li>
            <li> So far, both are working great.  </li>
            <li> It heats in three minutes to a perfectly comfortable temperature and can be used with most canisters.</li>
            <li> The foam comes out rich and warm to give you the special shave.</li>
            <li> The goal is to provide warm foam to the face to loosen whiskers better than ambient temperature foam, and this certainly does the job.  </li>
            <li> You made it soo easy to find and purchase</li>
            <li> It makes it easy to get the cream out</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easily changed out for what ever the customer likes.</li>
            <li> So easy to use.</li>
            <li> All of the controls are easy to use and operate as adverstised.  </li>
            <li> My old lather worked good for many years till it quit.</li>
            <li> HUSBAND LIKED THIS HOT LATHER MACHINE.</li>
            <li> I liked the hot gel idea.</li>
            <li> Warms up nicely but not too hot.</li>
            <li> Warm but no longer hot after a year</li>
            <li> You will not get hot lather with this unit, but it will be warm.  </li>
            <li> It works better on a full can.  </li>
            <li> Great work item received quickly and as advertised, like new.</li>
            <li> Heats fine in about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> It dispenses the lather fine</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly!</li>
            <li> Once I got it and opened the box, I realized how cheap it was and that it wouldn&#x27;t be what he was looking for.  </li>
            <li> It lets you really enjoy your shave.</li>
            <li> I have to shave everyday for work and this thing is great!    </li>
            <li> Carriers dropping packages off without signatures is such a great idea</li>
            <li> I purchased the item for my husband and he seems to enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews but could not believe them since mine has been such a great product.</li>
            <li> It is actually attractive enough to keep on the vanity as a tool and a decor.  </li>
            <li> Truly does what it says...produces warm lather, which my husband really likes about it.  </li>
            <li> Nice on sensitive skin uses the cheap shaving cream too!</li>
            <li> SO far so good, this one is working well.</li>
            <li> The foam is warm enough but not quite as warm as I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li> was exactly as advertised!!</li>
            <li> The new one looks impressive but it does not heat up the shaving cream above room temperature.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE HOT MACHINE.</li>
            <li> My favorite part of a haircut is the hot shave.  </li>
            <li> I now shave each day with hot gel, and I love it.  </li>
            <li> But he was excited about it, so we attempted to try it.  </li>
            <li> It came and my husband was so excited.</li>
            <li> It works well when the can is new, kind of so</li>
            <li> NO INSTRUCTIONS, HOWEVER, OF HOW TO PROPERLY &#x27;CLEAN&#x27; THIS MACHINE.  </li>
            <li> Poor to say the best does not get hot barely warm.</li>
            <li> A little warmer would be ideal.</li>
            <li> Over all it works very well and the onle thing I would change is to be able to set the temp.</li>
            <li> Wish gel would be hotter but overall its good</li>
            <li> The only product I have bought on amazon that I have nothing good to say about.</li>
            <li> Seemed pretty easy to put together and use.</li>
            <li> first, it&#x27;s not that easy to set up.  </li>
            <li> Nice and hot and heats up pretty fast!</li>
            <li> but I wish the foam heated up quickly.</li>
            <li> I know some folks have had these work well for them, but from reading many, many reviews it appears that buying one of these Conair devices is an enormous crap-shoot...</li>
            <li> This new unit is better as it shuts off automatically if you forget to turn it off.  </li>
            <li> Nothing like a hot shave!</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s the little things in life that makes one happy</li>
            <li> Only time will tell if these will hold on strong, but, for right now, I&#x27;m satisfied with them.    </li>
            <li> I had a nearly identical unit for many years which broke.</li>
            <li> This product is well worth the money for the function it provides.  </li>
            <li> A nice present i suppose.</li>
            <li> He is pleased with it because it works like his old Conair dispenser.</li>
            <li> Mine heats up instantly and the warm cream helps to soften my whiskers.</li>
            <li> He reports this unit does warm the shave cream in a regular can but not to what he was expecting.  </li>
            <li> IT IS WORTH PURCHASING.  </li>
            <li> It gives only modestly warm lather from gel of foam.</li>
            <li> Cap heater lasted 8 months before blowing out, but worth $39.</li>
            <li> But when it is warm enough, it is too runny.</li>
            <li> Still quite hot, but would be nice if you had a little more leeway there.      </li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t even feel good about trying to sell it at my garage sale the other day.  </li>
            <li> ALTHOUGH THE LATHER STARTS TO COME OUT RIGHT AWAY</li>
            <li> right with gel or</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;m doing it right.</li>
            <li> Nice to have hot shaving cream, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> It is a very good looking little machine and all commercial shaving cream cans fit.</li>
            <li> While function seems to be OK, even on the highest temp setting the lather is barely lukewarm when dispensed and by the time you apply it to your face</li>
            <li> Worked fine until it fell apart after only six months of light usage.  </li>
            <li> The large circle in top is in essence a button, and that is just staying completely depressed now, somewhere along the line it wore out and</li>
            <li> That seemed to be inevitable, but, luckily, they&#x27;re cheap and effective enough to justify having to repurchase every couple of years or so.      </li>
            <li> there is nothing wrong with a good warm shave</li>
            <li> I followed all the instructions, gave it plenty of time to warm up, and it comes out just barely warmer than it would have otherwise been at normal room temperature.  </li>
            <li> works great, only problem takes too long to warm up and could get cream a little warmer, but really enjoy it</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t seem to heat the lather very much.</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> YOUR LEGGS WITH HOT LEATHER.</li>
            <li> I wanted to have a hot shaving lather - this item provides a tepid lather, and does not produce a lather, but a product from a can of lather.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat a hot, barber shop style shave every morning</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get as hot as needed.</li>
            <li> control higher.</li>
            <li> Do not expect a hot lather, you won&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li> They said they did not manufacture this unit any more and that I was to find a unit similar and let them know.  </li>
            <li> HGL11 Combo Hot Gel/Lather Machine w/Chrome Finish.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe this \\&quot;chrome appearance\\&quot; justifies the higher price.</li>
            <li> This one is even better than the last one.</li>
            <li> Not as hot as I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> but it was hot.</li>
            <li> The shaving cream was that hot.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described in ad.</li>
            <li> Hot -- it is NOT.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy if you think you are going to have a \\&quot;hot lather</li>
            <li> to get his favorite shave \\&quot;cream\\&quot; (gel) can to mate up properly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not looking for hot ( burning) but  </li>
            <li> Hot shaving leather.</li>
            <li> The warm shaving cream really makes the daily chore so much easier.</li>
            <li> dispenses warm shaving cream, not up to what I expected.</li>
            <li> I have owned the previous cheap, plastic looking conair shaving dispenser which worked much better than this one.  </li>
            <li> The lather is comfortably warm, but not hot.</li>
            <li> Not hot but luke warm.</li>
            <li> A more viscous fluid would hold the heat longer, but then this isn&#x27;t really the goal.  </li>
            <li> First, don&#x27;t try using the large gel containers, doesn&#x27;t work well at all.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BELIEVE THESE POSITIVE REVIEWS.</li>
            <li> Then I put a can of foam on and it came out hot but very runny.</li>
            <li> He uses it everyday with no issues and loves the nice warm lather it makes from his regular old can of shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I was able to get a single luke-warm shave out of this product before it quit working (wouldn&#x27;t put gel into the warming chamber).  </li>
            <li> I subsequently purchase another unit and it is still working just fine.</li>
            <li> I tried switching it to gel (I used the gel attachment) and that seemed to work fine, however the entire heating assembly (the top) is not very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> The warm lather is very welcome especially in cold winters.</li>
            <li> I had the bright idea of not listening to the negative reviews on this product and bought 2 of these.  </li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t shut off and run a whole can of gel all over everything on my sink before I could get the can unhooked.</li>
            <li> My husband really enjoys using this machine.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t heat up as much as I would like either.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my brother who is a barber and he absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> too much counter space and maintenance to keep it flowing.</li>
            <li> Also, the heating of the cream takes much longer than the 3 minutes the instructions claim.  </li>
            <li> but I got too busy and it wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> He really seemed to&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast delivery too.</li>
            <li> Really wish I had read the reviews before purchasing mine.  </li>
            <li> He really likes it when it works-</li>
            <li> comes out only slightly warm and turns heat off after very short time.</li>
            <li> If the new one lasts as long as the prior version, at $45, it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
            <li> can at the neck, it doesn&#x27;t do a good job of heating the moderate amount of cream the average guy uses when he shaves his face.  </li>
            <li> Does the job adequately, dispense flow is a bit slow, seems more sturdy than older models.  </li>
            <li> More importantly, the machine only moderately heats up the lather - and takes a long time to do THAT</li>
            <li> I have used Conair hot lather machines in past years and was quite pleased with them; not so concerning this model,</li>
            <li> When it locks in, works decent.</li>
            <li> Cleaning the adapter and main unit didn&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this dispenser.</li>
            <li> My only comment would be that it gets the lather warm, but not hot.  </li>
            <li> adjustable heat and cleaner looks with much improved design compared to my old unit,  reaches temperature setting a lot faster</li>
            <li> Gels are dispensed slowly and barely warm.</li>
            <li> -so when it is half full, then pretty crummy as the can gets lower.  </li>
            <li> My husband had a very simple and easy to use dispenser that finally died.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about them is that, even at max setting, they don&#x27;t get quite as hot as the older models did.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in barber school and this product makes my station look a little more professional at non-professional price.</li>
            <li> Put a new can in the night before.</li>
            <li> Works easier when the unit is new</li>
            <li> The new one did not heat the lather the way it should..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long-time Conair Hot Lather Machine user going back 10 years or so.  </li>
            <li> wish there was one to actually give you hot lather.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get the lather hot enough</li>
            <li> I would agree with other reviews that the initial foam is hot and that after the first pump, the remainder isn&#x27;t nearly as hot as it should be.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li> DOES&#x27;NT GET HOT ENOUGH FOR ME.IT&#x27;LL</li>
            <li> This is the third Conair hot lathering machine I have purchased as gifts for my Dad-</li>
            <li> But, it is also small and light enough for quick storage if you choose.</li>
            <li> Feels great on those cold mornings.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t warm very well, ridiculously difficult to insert can, spills gel and cream everywhere while trying to insert</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care how much you spend they all work the same way, save your money.</li>
            <li> and this is really the only practical way of doing it yourself at home.  </li>
            <li> While I shave with an old style blade, you could use any razor.</li>
            <li> but it dont stay hot long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month so far.</li>
            <li> It warms the shaving cream faster than the old one did</li>
            <li> My husband has wanted one of these for a couple of years and the choices are:  this level or the professional level.  </li>
            <li> He uses the gel shaving cream and loves the warmth when he shaves in the early mornings in winter.</li>
            <li> His old one ( 10 yrs old) had gone out and he was upset that we could not find one in our home town, then I thought of the internet .</li>
            <li> It was a replacement for an old one that died.</li>
            <li> He was so surprised when he opened it up and saw what it was that I will remember the look on his face forever.  </li>
            <li> So far he is &amp;</li>
            <li> Wow what a concept.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s room temperature--the same it would be straight out of a can.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this item; most are made by the same manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Extremely frustrating early in the morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since changing the can from Aloe to regular shaving cream, seems to be working much more consistent.  </li>
            <li> I would go for a more expensive mode; that automatically shuts-off when it gets too hot.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting a better quality the price little high it can be less</li>
            <li> The Heated Shaving Cream dispenser was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> This first can is one I had on-hand when the device arrived, and YES it get&#x27;s hot but the cream is no longer thick from the can</li>
            <li> it realy does not really heat the shaving jel very well.</li>
            <li> It is not the same quality sa my old one.</li>
            <li> Purchased to replace a similar model that lasted nearly  3 years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Conair lather warmer for years which finally died of old age.  </li>
            <li> purchased for my father for christmas his old one took a dive last him</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s second Conair heated shaving cream dispenser, the first one stopped working suddenly after daily use for several years.</li>
            <li> Only takes one can size my old one took two can sizes.  </li>
            <li> When all is said in done, it is a nice looking heated shaving cream dispenser that fails to heat the shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> The temperature of the shaving cream is unpredictable - sometimes barely warm and on the other extreme, I heard an &amp;#34;Ouch!&amp;#34; coming from the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> First, chrome is a metal; this device is made of plastic, just as the black colored model is.</li>
            <li> The old models I&#x27;m used to using are long discontinued now, so I went ahead and purchased two of these newer models.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts - 6 months so far.</li>
            <li> Previous Conair dispensers I had earlier were much hotter.&lt;br /&gt;Hard</li>
            <li> Too much waiting time, with too little results.</li>
            <li> It barely heats the shaving cream, not much warmer then room temperature.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying different times ( how long on) for use.</li>
            <li> However I use it in my barber shop as a backup when my professional latherizer breaks down</li>
            <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t look bad sitting on the counter!</li>
            <li> While some reviewers complained that the heated foam didn&#x27;t stay hot very long, and blamed the unit, this is just another example of people not paying attention in physics class.  </li>
            <li> I (Walter) use it a lot and it makes a boring task a little more enjoyable.</li>
            <li> this is a definite exception and one I had to learn the hard way by way of wasting nearly the entire contents of one can.  </li>
            <li> it one-star because the only other device like this I owned was almost 40 years ago and the cream that came out</li>
            <li> I have used a different model of Conair Lather Heating System for years until the plastic started breaking due to age and years of heat.  </li>
            <li> We would buy other one in the future .</li>
            <li> At this price, we purchased a few for back up when the next one breaks.</li>
            <li> This is my second one the other one lasted me 2 years!</li>
            <li> Reading other reviews, I get the feeling that other users didn&#x27;t set their units up properly.</li>
            <li> Though it advertises that it will heat the cream in a couple of minutes, I routinely turn mine on 15 minutes before I shave in the morning and it only slightly warms the cream.  </li>
            <li> Not what we thought doesnt really get hot, disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have had shaves at the barber and there is not much difference to me.  </li>
            <li> Be careful that you put the correct nozzel on for the corresponding type of shave gel/lather that you use.</li>
            <li> This item is not very functional.  </li>
            <li> Having problems with the units getting jammed up ...</li>
            <li> but after you change a couple of containers it&#x27;s gets harder and harder to replace.  </li>
            <li> I can see that it could break if you aren&#x27;t careful.  </li>
            <li> Husband love it, no more cold shaves in the morning.</li>
            <li> We wasted about a half a can of shaving cream trying and finally gave up.  </li>
            <li> This is second Conair dispensor I have had over the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> It will stop working after the can is half empty but still has pressure and foam or gel.</li>
            <li> good product - instructions for using poor!!!!</li>
            <li> Then tried using regular shave cream didnt hardly heat up.waste of money going to return it.</li>
            <li> but it still not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit difficult when you press the button because the button is not &amp;#34;held in place&amp;#34; very well and seems flimsy.  </li>
            <li> It works well, but every time I use it I think of the money poured down the drain.</li>
            <li> This dispenser does not have heating coils that extend down the sides of the can like my previous Conair dispenser.  </li>
            <li> I like this lather machine, not as much as I do my previous ones from Conair.</li>
            <li> so I must always hit the ON button with each client, takes awhile to heat up also, not a quick recovery.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s had it less than a month and already stopped using it.  </li>
            <li> I threw it in the trash after less than 3 months.</li>
            <li> Even at less than half temperature, the shave foam comes out runny.  </li>
            <li> Just thought I&#x27;d warn anyone who uses that particular brand to not attempt to use it with this machine or you&#x27;ll be sorry.</li>
            <li> After purchasing this for a total of around $43, I was at Concord Mills Mall near Charlotte, NC and found the same device, but with a black base instead of chrome for $10.</li>
            <li> It was not worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> I would like it if it would get a little warmer than it works at.</li>
            <li> My husband said the heat doesn&#x27;t work that well with the gel he uses, because he uses so little.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very pleased with this $80 item.</li>
            <li> I have read other reviews of unhappy customers but they must be very sensitive.</li>
            <li> Conair Gel and Lather Heating System Won&#x27;t Leave You Cold VERY UNTRUE STATEMENT</li>
            <li> We  have cleaned it out and dried it out and followed everything the manuel suggested.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of time, money and shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Having trouble getting unit to heat lather.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Will provide follow-up feedback after using for a few months.</li>
            <li> Bought this item a few years ago; still trying to get it to work.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Original: I&#x27;m having some trouble figuring this out.  </li>
            <li> It was a waste of money for me</li>
            <li> it just plain doesn&#x27;t work anymore.  </li>
            <li> Nothing like the Conair machines of the past.</li>
            <li> You need to use the small gel containers.</li>
            <li> dispensing tip failed after only one can&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just glad I didn&#x27;t pay an awful lot for mine, which is headed for recycle bin...</li>
            <li> It does not heat the shaving cream sufficiently and is very messy to use.</li>
            <li> See the other 1-star reviews re: poor heating performance.  </li>
            <li> I have adjusted his knowledge base and he now understands the warmer works exactly like it is supposed to.  </li>
            <li> The instructions state very plainly that these can be used with both foam and gel, but</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s a little tough to review.</li>
            <li> This item is hard to find anywhere, sometimes stores will sell during the holidays but he could not wait so Amazon came through.</li>
            <li> SO PEOPLE, DON&#x27;T BLAME THE MACHINE, BUT USE COMMON LOGIC (HEAT ~ EXPANDS).  </li>
            <li> He said that once you shave with heated shaving cream you never want to go back to cold.</li>
            <li> Set up is a bit complicated by a multi step process, but certainly not a challenge.</li>
            <li> It is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> A little difficult to align the can and get it to stay in place while trying to set it up.  </li>
            <li> Not a good product.  </li>
            <li> No good.</li>
            <li> The button on the Gel head is very hard to operate and the appliance now leaks around the seam.</li>
            <li> He had searched extensively for a replacement and was frustrated when he was unable to locate one.  </li>
            <li> I have this machine and it is poorly made plastic.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s thin like you&#x27;d expect your barber to have.</li>
            <li> The heating element works poorly...</li>
            <li> Secondly, it&#x27;s not a great locking mechanism.</li>
            <li> Little disappointed</li>
            <li> All in all - an unfortunate incident.</li>
            <li> , output is awful and becomes almost zero as can depletes to half or so.  </li>
            <li> it will leave you cold.</li>
            <li> Conair Gel and Lather Heating System Won&#x27;t Leave You Cold]].</li>
            <li> I do not blame Amazon  for Conair&#x27;s  bad product design.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> For years I had wanted one of these and am extremely disappointed in mine.  </li>
            <li> Their customer service is worthless</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in the temperature of the cream.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift &amp; was very disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> will probably order some for Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> I bought this last month at a Bed Bath and Beyond and it didn&#x27;t work. I tried gel and lather and neither worked. I traded it in TWICE before giving up. This product does not work. DO NOT BELIEVE THESE POSITIVE REVIEWS.</li>
            <li> Terrible product.  Doesn&#x27;t warm very well, ridiculously difficult to insert can, spills gel and cream everywhere while trying to insert, output is awful and becomes almost zero as can depletes to half or so.  A total joke.</li>
            <li> Works great. A little warmer would be ideal. Great product</li>
            <li> It barely heats the shaving cream, not much warmer then room temperature. I haven&#x27;t found one yet that will give you nice warm shaving cream. I don&#x27;t care how much you spend they all work the same way, save your money.</li>
            <li> was exactly as advertised!! the gel/lather comes out quite warm. one suggestion to potential buyers,you need to turn it on 15-25 minutes before&lt;br /&gt;shaving.That way the gel/lather comes out very warm. GREAT PRODUCT!!!!!</li>
            <li> The product was delivered promptly no damage. I had a Conair before-liked it but it just wore out. This one is an improved model- I really like it!</li>
            <li> HUSBAND LIKED THIS HOT LATHER MACHINE. ALTHOUGH THE LATHER STARTS TO COME OUT RIGHT AWAY, I BELIEVE IT IS BECAUSE IT HEATS THE LATHER IN THE CAN, WHICH EXPANDS. SO PEOPLE, DON&#x27;T BLAME THE MACHINE, BUT USE COMMON LOGIC (HEAT ~ EXPANDS).  IT WORKS GREAT AND DOES NOT DRIP OR USE A LOT! THANK YOU.</li>
            <li> This is second Conair dispensor I have had over the past 10 years. This dispensor not only heats your shaving cream but also saves the amount of shaving cream used each time you shave. I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> !st time I ordered from amazon and it came when they said. The stores do not carry this item anymore. It works Great,,,I am going to buy one for my father....Thank You...</li>
            <li> This item is well woth the money. It is made of plastic and looks like chrome buts works great for the money. Nothing like a hot shave!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this thing.  I have been getting better and closer shaves since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a gentleman who hates to shave.  Fortunately, this makes it more pleasant!  It should also help with a stubborn beard.</li>
            <li> Works well. My only comment would be that it gets the lather warm, but not hot.  But, that could be by design.</li>
            <li> This is the replacement for one that lasted about 6 years before burning out.  I have had shaves at the barber and there is not much difference to me.  I have read other reviews of unhappy customers but they must be very sensitive.</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding product. Well worth the price!!! I have been using it for several weeks now and I am most pleased with its performance.It makes the shave more comfortable than before. It is very simple a can of gel into receptacle. It heats up within  a minute. I plan to give away several of these to my friend and family for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Poor to say the best does not get hot barely warm. Conair Gel and Lather Heating System Won&#x27;t Leave You Cold VERY UNTRUE STATEMENT it will leave you cold.</li>
            <li> I purchased this machine and thought it would operate the way it was advertised. I liked the hot gel idea. what a joke. It wouldn&#x27;t shut off and run a whole can of gel all over everything on my sink before I could get the can unhooked. Then I put a can of foam on and it came out hot but very runny. I&#x27;m not very pleased with this $80 item. I gave it a rating of 1 star.</li>
            <li> got this for xmas present.I like using gel for shaving.Put a new can in the night before.Next morning it had all leaked out every where.Then tried using regular shave cream didnt hardly heat up.waste of money going to return it.</li>
            <li> Bought one for my dad two years ago Christmas. He uses it everyday with no issues and loves the nice warm lather it makes from his regular old can of shaving cream.</li>
            <li> My son in law has been looking for one of these for years!  You made it soo easy to find and purchase and I know he&#x27;ll love this Christams gift!</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift and he loves it! Works great for the price. Be careful that you put the correct nozzel on for the corresponding type of shave gel/lather that you use. Otherwise it will keep foaming.</li>
            <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t look bad sitting on the counter! Warms up nicely but not too hot. Feels great on my face.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE HOT MACHINE. EVEN MY HUSBAND LOVES IT. NICE SHAVIN YOUR LEGGS WITH HOT LEATHER. TRY IT YOU MIGHT LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> We have used Conair shaving products for years.  This one was the biggest disappointment yet!!! It would work for a while and then quit. We  have cleaned it out and dried it out and followed everything the manuel suggested. NOTHING WORKED!!!! It was not worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> Heats fine in about 5 minutes. Feels great on those cold mornings.  Easy to set up, and to use, the wife even uses it!</li>
            <li> Had to spend over a $100.00 to get one that worked.  This one just didn&#x27;t do the job.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> My favorite part of a haircut is the hot shave.  My barber showed me what he was using.  I went online and found this item.  I now shave each day with hot gel, and I love it.  I&#x27;ll be buying several of these this year for Christmas gifts.  What a value!</li>
            <li> This item is not very functional.  I wanted to have a hot shaving lather - this item provides a tepid lather, and does not produce a lather, but a product from a can of lather.  Shopper beware. not shaken.  It is impractical to tear the item apart to shake the can to provide a lather. Shopper beware. On the Amazon guide page, it stated that people who bought this item also ordered Shaving Machine Cleaner and  Campbell&#x27;s Soap Concentrate.  I also ordered these two items, based on the recommendation..  Upon receipt, neither item was applicable to Lather Dispenser and  I returned these two items, unused.  All in all - an unfortunate incident.</li>
            <li> was great at first, but after about two months it stopped working</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and he loves it!  Nice to have hot shaving cream, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> The foams exits the machine quite well.  The temperature adjustment seems to cause no change in the cream temperature.  But it is fairly warm. A pretty good performer for the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long-time Conair Hot Lather Machine user going back 10 years or so.  You can&#x27;t beat a hot, barber shop style shave every morning and this is really the only practical way of doing it yourself at home.  These units have always worked quite well for me although they ALL eventually lost their ability to heat up the lather properly.  That seemed to be inevitable, but, luckily, they&#x27;re cheap and effective enough to justify having to repurchase every couple of years or so.      The old models I&#x27;m used to using are long discontinued now, so I went ahead and purchased two of these newer models.  So far, both are working great.  Very nice and stylish design, setup was pretty easy, and heats up quickly.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about them is that, even at max setting, they don&#x27;t get quite as hot as the older models did.  Still quite hot, but would be nice if you had a little more leeway there.      Only time will tell if these will hold on strong, but, for right now, I&#x27;m satisfied with them.    UPDATE:  It is NOT possible to use these machines with Gillette Fusion HydraGel.  It will hook up properly, but the gel will not stop pouring out and there&#x27;s nothing you can do to stop it!  The instructions state very plainly that these can be used with both foam and gel, but this is a definite exception and one I had to learn the hard way by way of wasting nearly the entire contents of one can.  Just thought I&#x27;d warn anyone who uses that particular brand to not attempt to use it with this machine or you&#x27;ll be sorry.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001M1JC6O Conair Gel and Lather Heating System Won&#x27;t Leave You Cold]]. This product is probably a good one. HOWEVER, the one I received was defective. The button on the Gel head is very hard to operate and the appliance now leaks around the seam. I hope it will be replaced.    Dave Jerviss      Jerviss@aol.com</li>
            <li> Warm but no longer hot after a year</li>
            <li> My husband really enjoys using this machine. It heats up your shaving cream so it feels nice and warm on your face making it more enjoyable to shave your face</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband as a birthday gift.  I looked for a better quality one on the internet but didn&#x27;t have any luck.  Once I got it and opened the box, I realized how cheap it was and that it wouldn&#x27;t be what he was looking for.  But he was excited about it, so we attempted to try it.  We never got the shaving cream can to snap in and lock.  We wasted about a half a can of shaving cream trying and finally gave up.  I sent it back.  Not a good product.  Nice thought and I wish it worked like I had hoped.</li>
            <li> there is nothing wrong with a good warm shave i love it the only thing I dont like waste too much shaving cream  like the button is stuck.</li>
            <li> Very cool. It lets you really enjoy your shave. Set up is a bit complicated by a multi step process, but certainly not a challenge. The lather is comfortably warm, but not hot.</li>
            <li> I have this machine and it is poorly made plastic.  It does not heat the shaving cream sufficiently and is very messy to use. Do not spend your money on this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. I was shopping for my friend, where she needed this for her husband for Christmas and it was exactly what he wanted and does an excellent job. He is well please with product</li>
            <li> 2 people tried to get it to work and it kept just shooting out shaving cream.  Gave up.</li>
            <li> Having problems with the units getting jammed up ...top push button seems to get stuck or doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> See the other 1-star reviews re: poor heating performance.  I was able to get a single luke-warm shave out of this product before it quit working (wouldn&#x27;t put gel into the warming chamber).  Of course I threw away the cap for the can of shaving gel, so I&#x27;m out that too.  What an awful product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get as hot as needed.</li>
            <li> Over all it works very well and the onle thing I would change is to be able to set the temp. control higher.</li>
            <li> It heats the shaving cream up to a warm lather and nothing more. Do not expect a hot lather, you won&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li> Unit work well for about a month, then quit working.  Warranty instructions directed a return of the unit to the manufacturer with a check for $3.00 for repair or replace.  This I did and did not hear from them for a couple of months.  I called and they acknowledged receiving the unit (and my check had been cashed).    They said they did not manufacture this unit any more and that I was to find a unit similar and let them know.  I have not found a similar unit.    I subsequently purchase another unit and it is still working just fine.</li>
            <li> You will not get hot lather with this unit, but it will be warm.  Also, it takes time to heat up. It does the job fine with a warm lather and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It leaks and does not work properly. Did not  work  right with gel or foam Threw it out it was so awful.  Piece of garbage!</li>
            <li> do not buy.  lost 1 can of shaving cream on it.  leaked from the top.  don&#x27;t be fooled by the good looking chrome!</li>
            <li> It came and my husband was so excited. Seemed pretty easy to put together and use. Except it didn&#x27;t work he uses gel shaving cream. It would never come out. Tried a different can still didn&#x27;t work. He company did give me a prompt refund and handled it will.</li>
            <li> I like this lather machine, not as much as I do my previous ones from Conair. It turns off every hour which can be nice for being at home. However I use it in my barber shop as a backup when my professional latherizer breaks down so I must always hit the ON button with each client, takes awhile to heat up also, not a quick recovery. Its tricky on putting can on the shave button might have lost about 1/2 a can of lather! Doesn&#x27;t heat up as much as I would like either.</li>
            <li> Works quite well, shaving cream is perfect, not too hot, just right, would recommend this product to other people, excellent buy</li>
            <li> It is nice.  My husband loves his warm shave.  However, it is all plastic.  We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts - 6 months so far.</li>
            <li> I have used Conair hot lather machines in past years and was quite pleased with them; not so concerning this model, HGL11 Combo Hot Gel/Lather Machine w/Chrome Finish. First, chrome is a metal; this device is made of plastic, just as the black colored model is. I don&#x27;t believe this \\&quot;chrome appearance\\&quot; justifies the higher price. More importantly, the machine only moderately heats up the lather - and takes a long time to do THAT (same results using gel). I waited from 6 to 10 minutes. After one push of the dispenser, the reheating process has to begin all over again. No good. Too much waiting time, with too little results. Nothing like the Conair machines of the past. Very disappointed. I returned it for a refund.</li>
            <li> It is a very good looking little machine and all commercial shaving cream cans fit. You need an electric outlet. The foam comes out rich and warm to give you the special shave. While I shave with an old style blade, you could use any razor. There is no need to use a shaving brush. I retired mine as it is easier to distribute the warm foam on the face.</li>
            <li> About eight years ago, I bought this same item.  The gasket finally gave way, so I had to get another.  This one is even better than the last one.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been wanting to get one of these or similar to this one for awhile. I am very disappointed in the temperature of the cream. It is luke warm at best even leaving it on longer than the directions say. It still doesn&#x27;t get it for me. It makes it easy to get the cream out but it still not worth the cost. wish there was one to actually give you hot lather.</li>
            <li> Nice product! I&#x27;m in barber school and this product makes my station look a little more professional at non-professional price. It would be nice if the lather got a lil warmer, but heyy it works.</li>
            <li> I was worried about buying this as a gift for my husband because of the mixed reviews, but he loves it! Says it works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;We will consider buying as a gift if we need one!</li>
            <li> My husband had been unable to find one in our area and was extremely pleased when we found it on the internet.  Just what he wanted and he is extremely pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Not as hot as I had hoped for. Previous Conair dispensers I had earlier were much hotter.&lt;br /&gt;Hard to see led lights</li>
            <li> Living in Michigan we have frosty weather in the winter. Anytime you can make something warmer it&#x27;s always better. My Dad loves this dispenser. It&#x27;s a luxury but a well-priced one-thanks!</li>
            <li> The last Conair seemed to get the shaving cream warmer.  This one is just barely warm. Little disappointed but I am using it.</li>
            <li> we had two of these that finally succumbed. this will be the dog&#x27;s Christmas present to ha daddy. he loves warm shaving cream (me too).. worked well in thepast!!!</li>
            <li> It is a shaving cream dispenser and does dispense shaving cream.:) There isn&#x27;t much more for it to do.But I did ding it one-star because the only other device like this I owned was almost 40 years ago and the cream that came out was still &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; like you&#x27;d expect from the can but it was hot. This first can is one I had on-hand when the device arrived, and YES it get&#x27;s hot but the cream is no longer thick from the can, it&#x27;s thin like you&#x27;d expect your barber to have. I&#x27;m hoping that I can find a better cream to use. NOTE that this may or may not be an issue for the device.</li>
            <li> Great work item received quickly and as advertised, like new.</li>
            <li> I had a nearly identical unit for many years which broke.It took for ever to put together and it realy does not really heat the shaving jel very well. It is not the same quality sa my old one.</li>
            <li> But I get what I order I wasn&#x27;t expecting a better quality the price little high it can be less</li>
            <li> It does the job but I wish the foam heated up quickly. Takes good 3-5 mins before you&#x27;ll feel the hot shave. I have not tried with the gel but that is also an option.</li>
            <li> This product is well worth the money for the function it provides.  I (Walter) use it a lot and it makes a boring task a little more enjoyable.</li>
            <li> It works better on a full can.  It works well when the can is new, kind of so-so when it is half full, then pretty crummy as the can gets lower.  Not as good quality as the ones the barber uses.  A nice present i suppose.</li>
            <li> I would like it if it would get a little warmer than it works at. I may not understand the instructions well.</li>
            <li> Great for the winter time, doesn&#x27;t get that hot, but it does the trick! Nice on sensitive skin uses the cheap shaving cream too!</li>
            <li> I got this for a gift for my husband.  He&#x27;s had it less than a month and already stopped using it.  The temperature of the shaving cream is unpredictable - sometimes barely warm and on the other extreme, I heard an &amp;#34;Ouch!&amp;#34; coming from the bathroom.  The shaving cream was that hot. It&#x27;s a really great concept, this one just doesn&#x27;t perform.</li>
            <li> adjustable heat and cleaner looks with much improved design compared to my old unit,  reaches temperature setting a lot faster</li>
            <li> Very good product.  Does just it is supposed to do.  Very good heated later or gel if you want it..</li>
            <li> I read the reviews &amp; decided to give it a try!! My husband uses it for shaving his head &amp; he loves it.</li>
            <li> it ok but it dont stay hot long</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift &amp; was very disappointed.  It doesn&#x27;t heat the shaving cream very well &amp; wastes a lot of cream because you can&#x27;t control the amount it dispenses.</li>
            <li> The Heated Shaving Cream dispenser was exactly what I expected.  Great value for the price!  I highly recommend this dispenser.</li>
            <li> Nice to see separate settings for foam and gel. Warms up quickly with a nice temperature. Recommended purchase, cost effective</li>
            <li> Nice and hot and heats up pretty fast! I look forward to shaving every morning now! I also love that you can use any shaving cream with it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I bought two as gifts recently.  The warm lather is very welcome especially in cold winters.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my brother who is a barber and he absolutely loves it.  You can use whatever shaving cream you like and it&#x27;s easily changed out for what ever the customer likes.</li>
            <li> This is a father&#x27;s day gift for my husband. He already has one and needed a spare for our second home. He loves it.</li>
            <li> Husband love it, no more cold shaves in the morning. So easy to use. He always showing it when friends stop over.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described in ad. It was given as a gift and recipient was very happy with it.</li>
            <li> It was ok, nothing to brag about. Lather just got wRm.</li>
            <li> The heating element works poorly...I have it on maximum and foam comes out only slightly warm and turns heat off after very short time.</li>
            <li> My son is going to Barber school and this is a very good item for him to use, I also use it for myself</li>
            <li> Purchased to replace a similar model that lasted nearly  3 years.  If the new one lasts as long as the prior version, at $45, it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
            <li> This is the third shaving cream dispenser I&#x27;ve purchased for my husband.  He is pleased with it because it works like his old Conair dispenser.</li>
            <li> This is the third unit I have owned. Seems like they last about two years. For the price that is OK.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of time, money and shaving cream. My husband had a very simple and easy to use dispenser that finally died. I thought this would be a good replacement - NOT. He still hasn&#x27;t figured out how to assemble it successfully but has used up 2 cans of shaving cream trying. It is a piece of junk. I have nothing good to say about it.</li>
            <li> Hot -- it is NOT. Tepid at best. I am very disappointed. My Conair HGL11 does NOT deliver. This is not an item to buy if you think you are going to get \\&quot;Hot\\&quot; lather. It is a waist of money. It is slightly warm when coming out, but before you can apply it -- it is room temperature.  Don&#x27;t buy if you think you are going to have a \\&quot;hot lather machine\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get the lather hot enough</li>
            <li> Works as advertised  happy with iy.</li>
            <li> What a pain to lock in the shaving cream vessel. First, don&#x27;t try using the large gel containers, doesn&#x27;t work well at all. You need to use the small gel containers. When it locks in, works decent. Not hot but luke warm. If it doesn&#x27;t snap it, the cream spews everywhere. Secondly, it&#x27;s not a great locking mechanism. Works easier when the unit is new but after you change a couple of containers it&#x27;s gets harder and harder to replace.  It&#x27;s now sitting under my sink, and every so often I try to get the can locked in..one more failed attempt and I am chucking it.</li>
            <li> Shaving with this device is very enjoyable. Reading other reviews, I get the feeling that other users didn&#x27;t set their units up properly. Mine heats up instantly and the warm cream helps to soften my whiskers.</li>
            <li> After reading numerous reviews- I decieded to purchase this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month so far. I would agree with other reviews that the initial foam is hot and that after the first pump, the remainder isn&#x27;t nearly as hot as it should be. However, that being said this product will definately help out with irritation. I used to breakout 90% of the time after shaving, and now, I never break out. I have to shave everyday for work and this thing is great!    For the price you get what you pay for and more!  Buy it:)</li>
            <li> I have used a different model of Conair Lather Heating System for years until the plastic started breaking due to age and years of heat.  I had the bright idea of not listening to the negative reviews on this product and bought 2 of these.  Mine started shooting gel out of every crack to include the twist on head and button to get the gel to come out. This was about 1 1/2 months of owning it.  I then started using my son&#x27;s who only had used his probably 3 times.  After 2 weeks of using his I had the same problem, gel started coming from every part of the head. Conair missed the mark on this model.  Run away!</li>
            <li> The gel dispenser works,  but the foam keeps leaking out. I know I&#x27;m doing it right. I&#x27;m following the instructions.</li>
            <li> Worked fine until it fell apart after only six months of light usage.  Their customer service is worthless</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Conair lather warmer for years which finally died of old age.  This new unit is better as it shuts off automatically if you forget to turn it off.  It warms the shaving cream faster than the old one did</li>
            <li> Brother thinks it could be warmer.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> My husband has wanted one of these for a couple of years and the choices are:  this level or the professional level.  He reports this unit does warm the shave cream in a regular can but not to what he was expecting.  This is not a fault of the unit but rather my husband&#x27;s perception of what you get at this price point.  I have adjusted his knowledge base and he now understands the warmer works exactly like it is supposed to.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This item properly heats shaving cream (I haven&#x27;t used it for gel) to a nice temperature for shaving.  While some reviewers complained that the heated foam didn&#x27;t stay hot very long, and blamed the unit, this is just another example of people not paying attention in physics class.  The foam is mostly air, and it easily gives up it heat (heat transfer) to the surrounding ambient air.  A more viscous fluid would hold the heat longer, but then this isn&#x27;t really the goal.  The goal is to provide warm foam to the face to loosen whiskers better than ambient temperature foam, and this certainly does the job.  This unit replaced a similar unit that I had for over 20 years, which these same reviewers would have criticized for the same reason.</li>
            <li> Never received this. So it&#x27;s a little tough to review. I think it would&#x27;ve been nice.  Carriers dropping packages off without signatures is such a great idea thanks. I&#x27;m moving my online orders to companies that allow selecting the option to request a signature for delivery.</li>
            <li> purchased for my father for christmas his old one took a dive last him about 5 ys look forward  for this one to last five yrs  great buy</li>
            <li> My guy likes it. He says it works good.&lt;br /&gt;Heats up great. its nice.&lt;br /&gt;Was concerned about it going together but it worked perfect,</li>
            <li> DOES WHAT IS SUPPOSED TO DO.  NO INSTRUCTIONS, HOWEVER, OF HOW TO PROPERLY &#x27;CLEAN&#x27; THIS MACHINE.  IT IS WORTH PURCHASING.  GIVES A WARM SHAVE. ---DJK</li>
            <li> Worked well until I replaced the can. It would never work again, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Having trouble getting unit to heat lather.</li>
            <li> I purchased the item for my husband and he seems to enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Every man should own one, holds any size can.</li>
            <li> My son loved getting this for xmas and he&#x27;s very happy with it!!</li>
            <li> This was a perfect gift for m husband. Instead of heating his shave cream in the microwave, this product makes it better.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my husband almost 3 years ago and have had no problems at all with the machine.  He uses the gel shaving cream and loves the warmth when he shaves in the early mornings in winter.</li>
            <li> I got two for gifts and they loved them.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a replacement for the one that I&#x27;ve owned for the last 15 years.  I read the reviews but could not believe them since mine has been such a great product. The new one looks impressive but it does not heat up the shaving cream above room temperature. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Wish I could mount it on the wall in my bathroom, but it does make shaving easier and closer and warmer.</li>
            <li> too much counter space and maintenance to keep it flowing. If you don&#x27;t use for a week better to detach shaving canister</li>
            <li> It dispenses the lather fine but it doesn&#x27;t seem to heat the lather very much.</li>
            <li> Husband threw it away!&lt;br /&gt;Poorly designed&lt;br /&gt;Hard to get his favorite shave \\&quot;cream\\&quot; (gel) can to mate up properly&lt;br /&gt;The dispensing tip failed after only one can&lt;br /&gt;Only heats to luke warm</li>
            <li> Takes about 4 minutes to heat-up.  Wish gel would be hotter but overall its good</li>
            <li> A little difficult to align the can and get it to stay in place while trying to set it up.  Also, the heating of the cream takes much longer than the 3 minutes the instructions claim.  Just received as a gift and am grateful for that.  Will provide follow-up feedback after using for a few months.</li>
            <li> It gives only modestly warm lather from gel of foam. It will stop working after the can is half empty but still has pressure and foam or gel. I threw it in the trash after less than 3 months.</li>
            <li> My husband is very pleased. He said that once you shave with heated shaving cream you never want to go back to cold. His old one ( 10 yrs old) had gone out and he was upset that we could not find one in our home town, then I thought of the internet .</li>
            <li> works great, only problem takes too long to warm up and could get cream a little warmer, but really enjoy it</li>
            <li> Does the job adequately, dispense flow is a bit slow, seems more sturdy than older models.  No idea on longevity as yet.</li>
            <li> Bought this item a few years ago; still trying to get it to work.  Shaving cream continues to dispense even when dispenser is off.  Gone thought lots of cans of shaving cream.  I have tried everything to include calling customer service.  This is a wonderful idea but a piece of junk that has major design flaws.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this item; most are made by the same manufacturer.</li>
            <li> It was a replacement for an old one that died. Hubby is using it and has no complaints. He&#x27;s especially loving it on these cool mornings.</li>
            <li> This is a great buy! It heats in three minutes to a perfectly comfortable temperature and can be used with most canisters. It despenses equal to what you would by hand. It is actually attractive enough to keep on the vanity as a tool and a decor.  But, it is also small and light enough for quick storage if you choose.</li>
            <li> Love it! Heats up quickly!</li>
            <li> I have owned the previous cheap, plastic looking conair shaving dispenser which worked much better than this one.  No matter how many times I re-seat the can, it is hit or miss getting the shaving cream out.  Extremely frustrating early in the morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since changing the can from Aloe to regular shaving cream, seems to be working much more consistent.  Maybe the can was the problem.  Upped to 3 stars as it is working much better</li>
            <li> Product tends to leak when you use the gel shaving cream, even on the gel setting. Very disappointed in the product</li>
            <li> My wife bought this for me last Christmas, and it worked wonderfully for about 6 months.  I tried switching it to gel (I used the gel attachment) and that seemed to work fine, however the entire heating assembly (the top) is not very sturdy.  The large circle in top is in essence a button, and that is just staying completely depressed now, somewhere along the line it wore out and no longer works.  I have to put about 20 pounds of pressure on the darn thing to get any shaving cream out of it when using foam.  When using gel it just plain doesn&#x27;t work anymore.  If this product were made with metals and built to last I&#x27;d give it 5 stars, it definitely heats the shaving cream to the desired temperature, however for me it falls into the category of &amp;#34;They just don&#x27;t make &#x27;em like they used to&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My old lather worked good for many years till it quit. The new one did not heat the lather the way it should.. I was very disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> The only product I have bought on amazon that I have nothing good to say about. I do not blame Amazon  for Conair&#x27;s  bad product design.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with this unit.  I love the warm shave cream in the morning.  I&#x27;ve been very happy with the performance.  There are some drawbacks...first, it&#x27;s not that easy to set up.  It&#x27;s a bit difficult when you press the button because the button is not &amp;#34;held in place&amp;#34; very well and seems flimsy.  I can see that it could break if you aren&#x27;t careful.  Otherwise, it works as advertised and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> It was for my Son I&#x27;m law he loves it. He said it works great. We would buy other one in the future .</li>
            <li> My husband said the heat doesn&#x27;t work that well with the gel he uses, because he uses so little.  By the time the heated gel gets through the nozzle, he already has enough room temperature gel to do the job.  We&#x27;re going to give it to a family member who uses shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Works great. It does take some time to heat up but does get the shaving cream good and hot. Great buy.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s second Conair heated shaving cream dispenser, the first one stopped working suddenly after daily use for several years. At this price, we purchased a few for back up when the next one breaks. SO far so good, this one is working well. This item is hard to find anywhere, sometimes stores will sell during the holidays but he could not wait so Amazon came through.</li>
            <li> Dispenser is not even warm.  I&#x27;m trying different times ( how long on) for use. I may return item. I&#x27;m not looking for hot ( burning) but  almost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks for the opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;Joseph Mari</li>
            <li> Great gift husband loved his new one...</li>
            <li> Leaks shaving cream out the sides. Only takes one can size my old one took two can sizes.  But it heats gel so so</li>
            <li> This dispenser does not have heating coils that extend down the sides of the can like my previous Conair dispenser.  Though it advertises that it will heat the cream in a couple of minutes, I routinely turn mine on 15 minutes before I shave in the morning and it only slightly warms the cream.  Since the heating element only contacts the shaving cream can at the neck, it doesn&#x27;t do a good job of heating the moderate amount of cream the average guy uses when he shaves his face.  All of the controls are easy to use and operate as adverstised.  When all is said in done, it is a nice looking heated shaving cream dispenser that fails to heat the shaving cream.  I wish I would have returned it and gotten my money back but I got too busy and it wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> Broke  almost instantly.</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift for my brother for Christmas after the last one he owned finally died. He had searched extensively for a replacement and was frustrated when he was unable to locate one.  He was so surprised when he opened it up and saw what it was that I will remember the look on his face forever.  So far he is &amp;#34;in love&amp;#34; with it.</li>
            <li> Wow what a concept. Hot shaving leather. I ordered this on my account for friend for her partner. So I have no idea whether they like it or not.</li>
            <li> Confort while you shave. The warm shaving cream really makes the daily chore so much easier. This is my second one the other one lasted me 2 years!</li>
            <li> Got his for my hubby for Father&#x27;s Day and he loves it.  Truly does what it says...produces warm lather, which my husband really likes about it.  No more running the hot tap water to splash on his face to shave in the mornings...now this produces hot/warm lather immediately.  Glad I purchased it for him!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my son for Christmas. He really seemed to&lt;br /&gt;like it for the shaving cream. Fast delivery too.</li>
            <li> After purchasing this for a total of around $43, I was at Concord Mills Mall near Charlotte, NC and found the same device, but with a black base instead of chrome for $10. It works well, but every time I use it I think of the money poured down the drain.</li>
            <li> Cap heater lasted 8 months before blowing out, but worth $39. I would go for a more expensive mode; that automatically shuts-off when it gets too hot.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband last Christmas and he loved it.</li>
            <li> Update (Mar 2015): After using this for just over 2 months, I discovered gel leading from the gel adapter.  Since it&#x27;s been on and dispensing gel from the same can for several weeks, I know it&#x27;s the unit that is faulty and not my installation.  I lost a good bit of gel.  Cleaning the adapter and main unit didn&#x27;t help.  I&#x27;ve contacted the seller for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original: I&#x27;m having some trouble figuring this out.  Even at less than half temperature, the shave foam comes out runny.  Gels are dispensed slowly and barely warm. The foam is warm enough but not quite as warm as I&#x27;d like.  But when it is warm enough, it is too runny.</li>
            <li> Conair has great products producing great results. Han oringal machine which didn&#x27;t use gel. This one uses both types of shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Yes, it works as advertised. But, the price has skyrocketed. The last one I purchased was about $25. It is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s the little things in life that makes one happy so please get this today and treat yourself to the best shave ever.</li>
            <li> Hubby loves his warmer.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband, but he says it is great, working well.</li>
            <li> Works Well if you follow instructions. Good for the Price</li>
            <li> Really wish I had read the reviews before purchasing mine.  For years I had wanted one of these and am extremely disappointed in mine.  While function seems to be OK, even on the highest temp setting the lather is barely lukewarm when dispensed and by the time you apply it to your face it&#x27;s room temperature--the same it would be straight out of a can.  I know some folks have had these work well for them, but from reading many, many reviews it appears that buying one of these Conair devices is an enormous crap-shoot...I&#x27;m just glad I didn&#x27;t pay an awful lot for mine, which is headed for recycle bin...</li>
            <li> Did not work,I had to return this product .</li>
            <li> I followed all the instructions, gave it plenty of time to warm up, and it comes out just barely warmer than it would have otherwise been at normal room temperature.  It was a waste of money for me and I couldn&#x27;t even feel good about trying to sell it at my garage sale the other day.  It&#x27;s in the trash.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband and he loves it! He especially likes how he can use any kind of shaving gel and it works perfectly!</li>
            <li> Had problems with this item &amp; don&#x27;t recall why/</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift to my husband and he loves it</li>
            <li> Not what we thought doesnt really get hot, disappointed.</li>
            <li> I LIKE IT .BUT DOES&#x27;NT GET HOT ENOUGH FOR ME.IT&#x27;LL DO THOUGH.</li>
            <li> good product - instructions for using poor!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the third Conair hot lathering machine I have purchased as gifts for my Dad- they seem to last only about 3 months, then get clogged and are unusable.  He really likes it when it works- I just wish this item lasted longer.</li>
            <li> My son loves the gel and lather heating system the best he ever used before.  very good quality!</li>
            <li> dispenses warm shaving cream, not up to what I expected. also, it does not seem to dispense all the gel in the can</li>
