            <li>They also came very fast and in perfect condition!!</li>
            <li>and I liked how the tubes fit my machine.</li>
            <li>Yes, the quality of the needles and tubes was fine.</li>
            <li>I found the grips to be comfortable</li>
            <li>Great for the most part, but it came with a couple of empty tubes and needles with messed up tips.</li>
            <li>This item showed up on time and from what I&#x27;ve used I haven&#x27;t seen any flaws, so far so good</li>
            <li>Other than that, I am happy with the product.</li>

            <li>only problem I have with these are that there isn&#x27;t much variety.</li>
            <li>You receive 95% Liners and Shaders and only 5% mags, which is what I really needed.</li>
            <li>I only gave it 4 stars because they were packed super tight and am unsure if that affected the needles at all.</li>
            <li>It came about 3 days later, I was surprised.</li>
            <li>Received 10 5m, 10 7rl, 10 7rs, 10 3rs, 10 9rs, not a wide range of needles</li>
            <li>It was all 3,5,7,9 RL, 3,5,7,9 RS, and barely any 5,7,9 M1s.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>

            <li> Liners, round shaders, Mags and in multiple sizes!!</li>
            <li> I ordered late evening on the 13 received by lunch on the 15.</li>
            <li> All needles and tubes have been properly packaged, and we have yet to come across any bad parts.</li>
            <li> The reason I&#x27;m giving this a 4 star rating is because the variety is very poor.</li>

It was all 3,5,7,9 RL, 3,5,7,9 RS, and barely any 5,7,9 M1s.&lt;br /&gt;All in all good quality but I wish they gave me a little more M1s for color packing.</li>
