            <li>Very pleased and would buy again.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and great for air travel carry on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a very mild but pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>Stick lathers easily and is a good value.  </li>
            <li>A good lather can be generated quite easily.  </li>
            <li>This is a fine shaving stick that produces good lather.  </li>
            <li>I used my Palmolive shave stick and got a great shave the first time!  </li>
            <li>this shave stick does not lather as nicely as Arko, plus it costs more.  </li>
            <li>Great for travel and quite economical.  </li>
            <li>Creates a very good lather and aids in a great wet shave.</li>
            <li>I think this shave stick is pretty great.  </li>
            <li>VERY cheap if you buy from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Really nice lather, easy to use---unbeatable for the price.  </li>
            <li>I have seen posts where people say you need to melt it and press it into a container for better results, but that defeats the purpose of a stick.  </li>
            <li>sure it says GUT 2,2 on the box.  </li>
            <li>: One more thing.  </li>
            <li>Now I get even more lather.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get much better than this for the price.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I probably need to spend more time learning to lather it -</li>
            <li>Many people say that it smells &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Coumarin - another aromatic considered a &amp;#34;base note&amp;#34; found in many fragrances.</li>
            <li>love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten closer shaves with better creams, but this stick is enjoyable and quite adequate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i love the combination of this shave stick and the brush.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>Great Product, Fast S&amp;H.</li>
            <li>Even with the junk cartridge razors most people use.</li>
            <li>After I read more about how to use them, I ordered one.</li>
            <li>My favorite shave stick I have tried.  </li>
            <li>, it is much better then Arko.  </li>
            <li>Nice clean scent.</li>
            <li>I find that having shaved for years and years I can now do a pretty good shave just by touch</li>
            <li>Very nice scent, decent lather.</li>
            <li>It seemed too cheap to be any good, but what the heck, worth trying.&lt;br /&gt;Using</li>
            <li>the Derby shave stick creates equally good lather and leaves the face feeling nice and soft.</li>
            <li>It smells ok, performs fine.</li>
            <li>Very nice scent, lathers easily, but not thick and creamy coverage like Arko.</li>
            <li>I find it easy to lather.</li>
            <li>Easy to use as it comes with a plastic handle.</li>
            <li>I wish it came in a bowl or puck as sticks are not as easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use and makes tons of lather.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, and it lathers up pretty well.  </li>
            <li>It smells just fine though.</li>
            <li>This is a fine soap.</li>
            <li>If you want a better lather, super lather it with the matching Palmolive cream.</li>
            <li>It applies easily, lathers quickly and well, and in my opinion smells pretty nice.  </li>
            <li>It lathers very well, and it has a nice clean soap smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad product, but prefer Arko for quality of lather as well as a bit more economical.</li>
            <li>It seems that the &amp;#34;bouquet&amp;#34; is based on:  Linalool - aromatic compound found in many spices, herbs (basil), hops and even cannabis (no, the soap doesn&#x27;t exactly smell like basil, cinnamon, hops or cannabis).  </li>
            <li>They also use it to perfume pipe tobacco, so that may be familiar to some people.  </li>
            <li>on the plus side, it does come with a little plastic grip at the bottom of the stick, which is nice for keeping a good grip.</li>
            <li>I have better smelling soaps that I can list but for pure performance and price, I have to give the nod to Palmolive.  </li>
            <li>The first WTG pass is smooth and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Instantly you&#x27;ll get a good lather up on your face.</li>
            <li>excellent product especially considering the low price.</li>
            <li>The first shave was with Merkur 37c Slant and Feather blade (also first time with that blade) - great shave overall, plenty in the brush for 3 passes + buffing.</li>
            <li>I get a VERY thick lather that does an excellent job lubricating my skin.  </li>
            <li>For the ATG close work I just swab by face with my brush again occasionally dipping my hand in the sink of warm water to spot-moisten as I go.  </li>
            <li>The quality of the lather is as good or better than more expensive products.</li>
            <li>the size is just right to pack in Motorcycle saddle bag .</li>
            <li>The price is right too.</li>
            <li>Great fragrance (clean, masculine patchouli---a little soapy ).  </li>
            <li>great thing about this shave stick is if I&#x27;m using another soap and it starts to thin or dry out, I can grab my Palmolive stick and rub real quick on my face (or head as I shave that also) and hit the area w/ my brush for more lather in no time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use a gillette fusion proglide and it works very very well.  </li>
            <li>I like the smell as well, and the price for this stick is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>One of the few tallow based shave soaps I own and the only shave soap in stick form that I own.  </li>
            <li>(maybe they still do) or tallow was not the first ingredient.</li>
            <li>Arko is clearly better product at about the same price point</li>
            <li>First experience with a shave soap.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled by the price, it is inexpensive and will last a for many shaves.</li>
            <li>Try any kind of plain unscented soap from a reputable store, they all seem much the same in use, and are usually really cheap to boot.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>Gave three stars due to comparison to Arko soap stick and my own shave soap that I now make and use.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much choice of brush in most places, so you&#x27;ll likely have to make do with what&#x27;s on sale.</li>
            <li>However, after I applied the brush, a thick lather began to develop, and the more I swirled the more lather appeared.  </li>
            <li>Another positive is that the airport security folks will pass this through.  </li>
            <li>Palmolive is a bit more expensive (in the USA), requires just a bit more soap application to face, and its lather isn&#x27;t quite as rich as Arko.</li>
            <li>I love the aroma and get slick, smooth shaves.</li>
            <li>I wish I could get them in a large puck form.&lt;br</li>
            <li>W/ my puck soaps, I now load the brush and go straight to my face</li>
            <li>I am not a perfumer, but I was very intrigued by the scent, so I went to read up on the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Palmolive is pretty good, but I was surprised by how small the stick is.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take up much room or weight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if other ingredients contribute to the smell, but they all seem to work to make a sort of a nice jazz chord, where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.</li>
            <li>Limonene - one of the main compounds responsible for the smell of citrus rinds.</li>
            <li>Smooth shave, and the stick lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>Well, that is both true and at the same time tells you nothing.</li>
            <li>lathers easier than this and also seems a bit &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34; so I gave this 4 stars and arko 5 stars, mainly considering what you get for the price.</li>
            <li>I like Arko a little better</li>
            <li>most commonly used home method used with a staving stick means first washing your face with soap before using the stick on your face .</li>
            <li>Applying stick to face allows the initial waxy soap layer to go on more sensitive areas for a bit of extra protection.</li>
            <li>Lathers well (using my new boar hair brush).</li>
            <li>Does have some staying power, so I would recommend pairing with a neutral, clean, or spice aftershave (I&#x27;m partial to Bay Rum).</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised by this increasingly popular shave stick (at least in the States).</li>
            <li>For the first 10 years of my shaving career the biggest problem I had with shaving apart from getting decent cutting razors &amp; blades at a good price was the shaving foam or creams.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The lather dries on the face, so maybe the only thing to remember is to keep adding hot water to your shaving brush and reapplying so</li>
            <li>(I say thoroughly, as I reckon leaving bits of old skin and beard in the razor to fester probably doesn&#x27;t do you much good, especially next time you cut yourself with the razor).&lt;br /&gt;All done - now you have a face as smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind, or maybe even as smooth as Larry David&#x27;s unfeasably smooth face - he must have had a skin transplant from asome poor little baby!&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>Wow wow wow!</li>
            <li>(I had to do without a few months ago and it was fine but slower than with a mirror).</li>
            <li>By comparison Williams soap is more like a single clear (but forgettable) tone - a kazoo or dial tone :)  </li>
            <li>This is my least favorite of the shaving sticks.  </li>
            <li>I tried the old fashioned shaving stick.</li>
            <li>get your shaving brush, rinse under a hot tap, and while it&#x27;s still wet with hot water rub vigerously overthe shaving soap on your skin (barber shops sometimes do things a bit differently, sometimes they&#x27;ll use a shaving bowl and get the lather going in that).</li>
            <li>You can use it like a crayon directly on your hair, or you can grate or cut a chunk off and press it into a bowl/cup to lather it up.  </li>
            <li>, I really don&#x27;t feel it as such.  </li>
            <li>Only in the coldest and driest winter days do I really need to use any after shave balm.  </li>
            <li>An old favourite that is just as I remember it.</li>
            <li>Smells like something a 41 year old would use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s worth trying your local barber for sticks and brushes as they often likely stock shaving sticks and brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>let you beard pull off the ammount of soap needed, use a wet shave brush to make the lather right on your face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly I use a piece of plastic wrap and cover the soap chips and a drinking glass to press the chips downs into the mug so that I am left with a (more or less) solid chunk of soap in the mug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since, as far as I know, this soap isn&#x27;t available in a puck, I engineered a way to use these sticks in my everyday shave mug.  </li>
            <li>Definitley take the time to hot towel and use single d/e blades for closer shave.</li>
            <li>Smooth, slick, provides plenty of cushion.  </li>
            <li>This shave stick is easy to use in the shower and lathers well in my hard water.  </li>
            <li>Has thick pillows of smooth lather.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I didn&#x27;t like the scent at first (from the box), but remember thinking that it was &amp;#34;peppery&amp;#34; (like black peppercorns).</li>
            <li>I can only the describe the smell as being familiar and something I would recognize from the past.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, based on earlier reviews, I was hoping for something a little more special like the Arko shaving stick or LaToja.  </li>
            <li>Apply directly to face then use wet shaving brush directly on face and wha la.</li>
            <li>I recently flew internationally and had no trouble with any security checks.  </li>
            <li>Does the trick for half a day shaves when you don&#x27;t have too much hair grown in.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it seemed like very little was getting on my face.  </li>

            <li> It applies easily, lathers quickly and well, and in my opinion smells pretty nice.  </li>
            <li> It lathers very well, and it has a nice clean soap smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad product, but prefer Arko for quality of lather as well as a bit more economical.</li>
            <li> It seems that the &amp;#34;bouquet&amp;#34; is based on:  Linalool - aromatic compound found in many spices, herbs (basil), hops and even cannabis (no, the soap doesn&#x27;t exactly smell like basil, cinnamon, hops or cannabis).  </li>
            <li> They also use it to perfume pipe tobacco, so that may be familiar to some people.  </li>
            <li> on the plus side, it does come with a little plastic grip at the bottom of the stick, which is nice for keeping a good grip.</li>
            <li> I have better smelling soaps that I can list but for pure performance and price, I have to give the nod to Palmolive.  </li>
            <li> The first WTG pass is smooth and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Instantly you&#x27;ll get a good lather up on your face.</li>
            <li> excellent product especially considering the low price.</li>
            <li> The first shave was with Merkur 37c Slant and Feather blade (also first time with that blade) - great shave overall, plenty in the brush for 3 passes + buffing.</li>
            <li> I get a VERY thick lather that does an excellent job lubricating my skin.  </li>
            <li> For the ATG close work I just swab by face with my brush again occasionally dipping my hand in the sink of warm water to spot-moisten as I go.  </li>
            <li> The quality of the lather is as good or better than more expensive products.</li>
            <li> the size is just right to pack in Motorcycle saddle bag .</li>
            <li> The price is right too.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance (clean, masculine patchouli---a little soapy ).  </li>
            <li> great thing about this shave stick is if I&#x27;m using another soap and it starts to thin or dry out, I can grab my Palmolive stick and rub real quick on my face (or head as I shave that also) and hit the area w/ my brush for more lather in no time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use a gillette fusion proglide and it works very very well.  </li>
            <li> I like the smell as well, and the price for this stick is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li> One of the few tallow based shave soaps I own and the only shave soap in stick form that I own.  </li>
            <li> (maybe they still do) or tallow was not the first ingredient.</li>
            <li> Arko is clearly better product at about the same price point</li>
            <li> First experience with a shave soap.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the price, it is inexpensive and will last a for many shaves.</li>
            <li> Try any kind of plain unscented soap from a reputable store, they all seem much the same in use, and are usually really cheap to boot.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> Gave three stars due to comparison to Arko soap stick and my own shave soap that I now make and use.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much choice of brush in most places, so you&#x27;ll likely have to make do with what&#x27;s on sale.</li>
            <li> However, after I applied the brush, a thick lather began to develop, and the more I swirled the more lather appeared.  </li>
            <li> Another positive is that the airport security folks will pass this through.  </li>
            <li> Palmolive is a bit more expensive (in the USA), requires just a bit more soap application to face, and its lather isn&#x27;t quite as rich as Arko.</li>
            <li> I love the aroma and get slick, smooth shaves.</li>
            <li> I wish I could get them in a large puck form.&lt;br</li>
            <li> W/ my puck soaps, I now load the brush and go straight to my face</li>
            <li> I am not a perfumer, but I was very intrigued by the scent, so I went to read up on the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Palmolive is pretty good, but I was surprised by how small the stick is.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take up much room or weight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if other ingredients contribute to the smell, but they all seem to work to make a sort of a nice jazz chord, where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.</li>
            <li> Limonene - one of the main compounds responsible for the smell of citrus rinds.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave, and the stick lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Well, that is both true and at the same time tells you nothing.</li>
            <li> lathers easier than this and also seems a bit &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34; so I gave this 4 stars and arko 5 stars, mainly considering what you get for the price.</li>
            <li> I like Arko a little better</li>
            <li> most commonly used home method used with a staving stick means first washing your face with soap before using the stick on your face .</li>
            <li> Applying stick to face allows the initial waxy soap layer to go on more sensitive areas for a bit of extra protection.</li>
            <li> Lathers well (using my new boar hair brush).</li>
            <li> Does have some staying power, so I would recommend pairing with a neutral, clean, or spice aftershave (I&#x27;m partial to Bay Rum).</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised by this increasingly popular shave stick (at least in the States).</li>
            <li> For the first 10 years of my shaving career the biggest problem I had with shaving apart from getting decent cutting razors &amp; blades at a good price was the shaving foam or creams.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> The lather dries on the face, so maybe the only thing to remember is to keep adding hot water to your shaving brush and reapplying so</li>
            <li> (I say thoroughly, as I reckon leaving bits of old skin and beard in the razor to fester probably doesn&#x27;t do you much good, especially next time you cut yourself with the razor).&lt;br /&gt;All done - now you have a face as smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind, or maybe even as smooth as Larry David&#x27;s unfeasably smooth face - he must have had a skin transplant from asome poor little baby!&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Wow wow wow!</li>
            <li> (I had to do without a few months ago and it was fine but slower than with a mirror).</li>
            <li> By comparison Williams soap is more like a single clear (but forgettable) tone - a kazoo or dial tone :)  </li>
            <li> This is my least favorite of the shaving sticks.  </li>
            <li> I tried the old fashioned shaving stick.</li>
            <li> get your shaving brush, rinse under a hot tap, and while it&#x27;s still wet with hot water rub vigerously overthe shaving soap on your skin (barber shops sometimes do things a bit differently, sometimes they&#x27;ll use a shaving bowl and get the lather going in that).</li>
            <li> You can use it like a crayon directly on your hair, or you can grate or cut a chunk off and press it into a bowl/cup to lather it up.  </li>
            <li> , I really don&#x27;t feel it as such.  </li>
            <li> Only in the coldest and driest winter days do I really need to use any after shave balm.  </li>
            <li> An old favourite that is just as I remember it.</li>
            <li> Smells like something a 41 year old would use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s worth trying your local barber for sticks and brushes as they often likely stock shaving sticks and brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> let you beard pull off the ammount of soap needed, use a wet shave brush to make the lather right on your face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly I use a piece of plastic wrap and cover the soap chips and a drinking glass to press the chips downs into the mug so that I am left with a (more or less) solid chunk of soap in the mug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since, as far as I know, this soap isn&#x27;t available in a puck, I engineered a way to use these sticks in my everyday shave mug.  </li>
            <li> Definitley take the time to hot towel and use single d/e blades for closer shave.</li>
            <li> Smooth, slick, provides plenty of cushion.  </li>
            <li> This shave stick is easy to use in the shower and lathers well in my hard water.  </li>
            <li> Has thick pillows of smooth lather.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I didn&#x27;t like the scent at first (from the box), but remember thinking that it was &amp;#34;peppery&amp;#34; (like black peppercorns).</li>
            <li> I can only the describe the smell as being familiar and something I would recognize from the past.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, based on earlier reviews, I was hoping for something a little more special like the Arko shaving stick or LaToja.  </li>
            <li> Apply directly to face then use wet shaving brush directly on face and wha la.</li>
            <li> I recently flew internationally and had no trouble with any security checks.  </li>
            <li> Does the trick for half a day shaves when you don&#x27;t have too much hair grown in.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it seemed like very little was getting on my face.  </li>
            <li> , I find the shaving stick lasts for about at least two or three months, and with a little care you can easily stretch that to four or five.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t dry with a towel or anything, then rub the shaving stick (after taking off the foil wrapping) over those places on your face where you want to shave except for your upper lip (I find you&#x27;ll get plenty enough lather from the rest of your face).&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and (when lathered properly)</li>
            <li> It will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> It smells like toilet bowl cleaner, which is why I&#x27;m giving it four stars and not five.  </li>
            <li> rinse the brush in hot water, vigerously shake off the excess water and put the brish aside to dry.&lt;br /&gt;Now shave with your choice of razor, and when finished, rinse your face with cold water, then thoroughly rinse your razor with hot water and put aside to dry</li>
            <li> The scent is hard to describe but very soapy evergreen type of scent.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it as a stick for too long before I grated it in a bowl.</li>
            <li> but this is right behind it.</li>
            <li> The Palmolive shave stick is a high quality hard soap.</li>
            <li> , I only use basic ordinary soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they made a different formulation w/o tallow some years back</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s odd that it&#x27;s produced in Europe, since I&#x27;ve always considered Palmolive an American product line.</li>
            <li> I do then is to rinse the soap off with tepid water, leave it wet</li>
            <li> The recommended way to use this product is to rub it over your wet beard and then take a brush and lather up.  </li>
            <li> the lather stays wet.  </li>
            <li> Just rub the soap on your wet face and take a wet brush to it</li>
            <li> Wet your whiskers, wet the end of the stick, rub it in, and use a wet finger to make a lather.  </li>
            <li> I shave every other day.</li>
            <li> need to buy at least 2 of them because they are not real big.  </li>
            <li> It will last for at least one year.  </li>
            <li> and I had to rinse a lot of it down the sink.  </li>
            <li> Look around though, this stuff can be had for less.</li>
            <li> I read about Palmolive stick on shaving forums and everyone was raving about it (but perhaps some of the raves are based on the fact that it costs 50 pence or less in the UK pharmacies, not the value we get here in the US).  </li>
            <li> Palmolive is a classic and you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It made little difference what the brand was, after a while</li>
            <li> For some reason, this stick is a little drying on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t mind using this as my everyday soap.  </li>
            <li> and you have loads of lather in a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I grate the stick into small chips.</li>
            <li> The lather is slick and thick, just what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Unlike the 1-dimensional Williams puck (citronella scent), this soap has a complex, although not overbearing, scent.</li>
            <li> I rate this product a 5 as I cannot think of anything negative to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Citronellol - there&#x27;s your citronella scent, but it must be so subtle</li>
            <li> Not for tough beards.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient to carry in my travel kit and makes it unnecessary to carry a lather bowl.  </li>
            <li> Too bad this product cannot be found in grocery stores and drug stores as with other shaving products, and must be ordered.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very subtle - doesn&#x27;t come across citrussy at all.  </li>
            <li> Either way, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> The scent is very difficult to describe.</li>
            <li> a shaving stick means you have to buy a shaving brush and some bar soap (but unless you&#x27;re a real stinker or you&#x27;ve been brainwashed for years into buying pricey liquid soap you&#x27;re bound to have some kicking around).</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my least favorite of the shaving sticks.  I have seen posts where people say you need to melt it and press it into a container for better results, but that defeats the purpose of a stick.  I see no reason to continue to keep this product in the shaving arsenal.</li>
            <li> Wow! Wow wow wow! Pleasantly surprised by this increasingly popular shave stick (at least in the States). Great for travel, give it a go!</li>
            <li> this shave stick does not lather as nicely as Arko, plus it costs more.  on the plus side, it does come with a little plastic grip at the bottom of the stick, which is nice for keeping a good grip.</li>
            <li> For the first 10 years of my shaving career the biggest problem I had with shaving apart from getting decent cutting razors &amp; blades at a good price was the shaving foam or creams. After using the same brand foams or creams for a few months I&#x27;d always end up getting a really sore rash after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;It made little difference what the brand was, after a while I&#x27;d always get a reaction. I&#x27;m no woose, but you soon get fed up with pimpley rashes, nicks, blood spots on your collar / t-shirt etc.etc.&lt;br /&gt;So out of desperation I tried the old fashioned shaving stick. The only brand I could see on sale at the time was Palmolive so I got one of those. It seemed too cheap to be any good, but what the heck, worth trying.&lt;br /&gt;Using a shaving stick means you have to buy a shaving brush and some bar soap (but unless you&#x27;re a real stinker or you&#x27;ve been brainwashed for years into buying pricey liquid soap you&#x27;re bound to have some kicking around). There isn&#x27;t much choice of brush in most places, so you&#x27;ll likely have to make do with what&#x27;s on sale. I got a Wilkinson Sword one that was only a couple of British pounds and it&#x27;s still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;The most commonly used home method used with a staving stick means first washing your face with soap before using the stick on your face . As I have baby skin that doesn&#x27;t like scents (scents are for girls anyhow aren&#x27;t they?), I only use basic ordinary soap. Try any kind of plain unscented soap from a reputable store, they all seem much the same in use, and are usually really cheap to boot.&lt;br /&gt;What I do then is to rinse the soap off with tepid water, leave it wet so don&#x27;t dry with a towel or anything, then rub the shaving stick (after taking off the foil wrapping) over those places on your face where you want to shave except for your upper lip (I find you&#x27;ll get plenty enough lather from the rest of your face).&lt;br /&gt;Then get your shaving brush, rinse under a hot tap, and while it&#x27;s still wet with hot water rub vigerously overthe shaving soap on your skin (barber shops sometimes do things a bit differently, sometimes they&#x27;ll use a shaving bowl and get the lather going in that). Instantly you&#x27;ll get a good lather up on your face. Use the brush to spread the lather around evenly - if you&#x27;ve ever put cream or icing on a cake it&#x27;ll be easy-peasy.&lt;br /&gt;Then rinse the brush in hot water, vigerously shake off the excess water and put the brish aside to dry.&lt;br /&gt;Now shave with your choice of razor, and when finished, rinse your face with cold water, then thoroughly rinse your razor with hot water and put aside to dry (I say thoroughly, as I reckon leaving bits of old skin and beard in the razor to fester probably doesn&#x27;t do you much good, especially next time you cut yourself with the razor).&lt;br /&gt;All done - now you have a face as smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind, or maybe even as smooth as Larry David&#x27;s unfeasably smooth face - he must have had a skin transplant from asome poor little baby!&lt;br /&gt;For the cheapskates among you, I find the shaving stick lasts for about at least two or three months, and with a little care you can easily stretch that to four or five.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth trying your local barber for sticks and brushes as they often likely stock shaving sticks and brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Oh I forgot to mention you probably need a mirror. I find that having shaved for years and years I can now do a pretty good shave just by touch (I had to do without a few months ago and it was fine but slower than with a mirror).</li>
            <li> This is a fine shaving stick that produces good lather.  Unfortunately, based on earlier reviews, I was hoping for something a little more special like the Arko shaving stick or LaToja.  This was neither.  Just a workman like, not-remarkable, not-expensive shaving product.  Priced accordingly. Will not buy again.  Life is short.</li>
            <li> One of the few tallow based shave soaps I own and the only shave soap in stick form that I own.  Also, it was the shave soap that got me into face lathering.  W/ my puck soaps, I now load the brush and go straight to my face w/ my brush instead of building a lather in a bowl.&lt;br /&gt;A great thing about this shave stick is if I&#x27;m using another soap and it starts to thin or dry out, I can grab my Palmolive stick and rub real quick on my face (or head as I shave that also) and hit the area w/ my brush for more lather in no time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two things you need to know though if you never used this before.&lt;br /&gt;1)You need to buy at least 2 of them because they are not real big.  I wish I could get them in a large puck form.&lt;br /&gt;2)Make sure it says GUT 2,2 on the box.  I&#x27;m not sure if they made a different formulation w/o tallow some years back (maybe they still do) or tallow was not the first ingredient. The GUT 2,2 is the good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA: One more thing.  The scent is nothing to write home about.  I have better smelling soaps that I can list but for pure performance and price, I have to give the nod to Palmolive.  It smells just fine though.</li>
            <li> A wonderful shave stick.  Great for travel and quite economical.  I find it easy to lather.</li>
            <li> I think this shave stick is pretty great.  It applies easily, lathers quickly and well, and in my opinion smells pretty nice.  It&#x27;s convenient to carry in my travel kit and makes it unnecessary to carry a lather bowl.  I give it 4 stars.  I would give 5 but I think the price could be lower.</li>
            <li> This shave stick is easy to use in the shower and lathers well in my hard water.  You can use it like a crayon directly on your hair, or you can grate or cut a chunk off and press it into a bowl/cup to lather it up.  It&#x27;s great for people who are newbies to lathering or who travel a lot.  It lasts a long time and (when lathered properly) doesn&#x27;t leave a film on my shaving equipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People said that this shave stick smells like dishwashing liquid or Irish Spring.  It doesn&#x27;t.  It smells like toilet bowl cleaner, which is why I&#x27;m giving it four stars and not five.  The smell lingers for hours and I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again when it runs out.</li>
            <li> Works great, smells great. Has thick pillows of smooth lather. I didn&#x27;t use it as a stick for too long before I grated it in a bowl. Now I get even more lather. I will buy 2 next time one to leave as a stick for travel and one to grate into a bowl.  It doesn&#x27;t get much better than this for the price. Look around though, this stuff can be had for less. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Good for Travel the size is just right to pack in Motorcycle saddle bag . Whips up in a good lather. Apply directly to face then use wet shaving brush directly on face and wha la.</li>
            <li> Stick lathers easily and is a good value.  For some reason, this stick is a little drying on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMO the Derby shave stick creates equally good lather and leaves the face feeling nice and soft.</li>
            <li> This shave soap is perfect for travel. It lathers very well, and it has a nice clean soap smell. Just rub it generously on your face and lather with a brush. All for a great price. I just ordered one for a friend.</li>
            <li> Not for tough beards.  Does the trick for half a day shaves when you don&#x27;t have too much hair grown in.  Definitley take the time to hot towel and use single d/e blades for closer shave.</li>
            <li> I read about Palmolive stick on shaving forums and everyone was raving about it (but perhaps some of the raves are based on the fact that it costs 50 pence or less in the UK pharmacies, not the value we get here in the US).  Anyway, I didn&#x27;t like the scent at first (from the box), but remember thinking that it was &amp;#34;peppery&amp;#34; (like black peppercorns). I&#x27;ve only shaved twice with it and actually grew to like the scent. The first shave was with Merkur 37c Slant and Feather blade (also first time with that blade) - great shave overall, plenty in the brush for 3 passes + buffing. Second shave I forget which blade I used, but maybe I was in a hurry - the lather wasn&#x27;t as good and I had to go back to my Proraso. I probably need to spend more time learning to lather it - I&#x27;ve read that tallow soaps can be like that.  I am not a perfumer, but I was very intrigued by the scent, so I went to read up on the ingredients. The scent is very difficult to describe. Many people say that it smells &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34;. Well, that is both true and at the same time tells you nothing. Unlike the 1-dimensional Williams puck (citronella scent), this soap has a complex, although not overbearing, scent. Very pleasant. Here&#x27;s what I found:  It seems that the &amp;#34;bouquet&amp;#34; is based on:  Linalool - aromatic compound found in many spices, herbs (basil), hops and even cannabis (no, the soap doesn&#x27;t exactly smell like basil, cinnamon, hops or cannabis).  Limonene - one of the main compounds responsible for the smell of citrus rinds. But in Palmolive stick it&#x27;s very subtle - doesn&#x27;t come across citrussy at all.  Citronellol - there&#x27;s your citronella scent, but it must be so subtle, I really don&#x27;t feel it as such.  Coumarin - another aromatic considered a &amp;#34;base note&amp;#34; found in many fragrances. They also use it to perfume pipe tobacco, so that may be familiar to some people.  I&#x27;m not sure if other ingredients contribute to the smell, but they all seem to work to make a sort of a nice jazz chord, where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. By comparison Williams soap is more like a single clear (but forgettable) tone - a kazoo or dial tone :)  I&#x27;ll update on performance.</li>
            <li> Very nice scent, decent lather. Great for travelling or for those days when you don&#x27;t want to mix lather in a bowl. It&#x27;s odd that it&#x27;s produced in Europe, since I&#x27;ve always considered Palmolive an American product line.</li>
            <li> Had one of these sitting around for a year and finally cracked it open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it.  Great fragrance (clean, masculine patchouli---a little soapy ).  Really nice lather, easy to use---unbeatable for the price.  I&#x27;ve gotten closer shaves with better creams, but this stick is enjoyable and quite adequate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 star performance...but a 5th star for value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for a couple of years now, but I haven&#x27;t been using it quite as intended.  But if you just want to know what I think of the soap... It&#x27;s great!  I get a VERY thick lather that does an excellent job lubricating my skin.  The scent is very nice as well. It&#x27;s not perfumy like a cologne nor too \\&quot;soapy\\&quot;. It&#x27;s just a very mild but pleasant scent.  The first WTG pass is smooth and comfortable.  For the ATG close work I just swab by face with my brush again occasionally dipping my hand in the sink of warm water to spot-moisten as I go.  Only in the coldest and driest winter days do I really need to use any after shave balm.  I rate this product a 5 as I cannot think of anything negative to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in case you are wondering what I do with these sticks that is non-standard, read on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I remove all the foil from the stick.&lt;br /&gt;Second, using the coarse side of a cheese grater I grate the stick into small chips. I grate 2 sticks at a time.&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly, I take the pile of soap shavings and place them in my shave mug so that they evenly cover the bottom. I use a Colonel Conk Model 129 mug.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly I use a piece of plastic wrap and cover the soap chips and a drinking glass to press the chips downs into the mug so that I am left with a (more or less) solid chunk of soap in the mug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since, as far as I know, this soap isn&#x27;t available in a puck, I engineered a way to use these sticks in my everyday shave mug.  It&#x27;s a bit of effort, but I only have to do this a couple of times a year.</li>
            <li> As a beginner on using the badger hair brush to lather up, i think this was perfect.  i love the combination of this shave stick and the brush.  I use a gillette fusion proglide and it works very very well.  It smells nice, and it lathers up pretty well.  If you are beginner, this is for you.  It will last a long time.  I have been going on for 3 months now with the same stick. I am about 1/5 done. It will last for at least one year.  I shave every other day.</li>
            <li> An old favourite that is just as I remember it. Good value and a great shave.</li>
            <li> Pleasant bouquet. Applying stick to face allows the initial waxy soap layer to go on more sensitive areas for a bit of extra protection. I only apply stick to about 60% of shaving area. Lathers well but I don&#x27;t think it protects all that well. Gave three stars due to comparison to Arko soap stick and my own shave soap that I now make and use. Palmolive is a bit more expensive (in the USA), requires just a bit more soap application to face, and its lather isn&#x27;t quite as rich as Arko. It&#x27;s not a bad product, but prefer Arko for quality of lather as well as a bit more economical.</li>
            <li> Very nice scent, lathers easily, but not thick and creamy coverage like Arko. Arko is clearly better product at about the same price point</li>
            <li> First experience with a shave soap. After tireless research I went with what appeared to be a can&#x27;t miss and I&#x27;m glad I did. Easy to use as it comes with a plastic handle. Lathers well (using my new boar hair brush). I can only the describe the smell as being familiar and something I would recognize from the past. Nice clean scent. Smells like something a 41 year old would use. Does have some staying power, so I would recommend pairing with a neutral, clean, or spice aftershave (I&#x27;m partial to Bay Rum). Very pleased and would buy again.</li>
            <li> Very nice!!! Similar to Spieck. I wish it came in a bowl or puck as sticks are not as easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great Product, Fast S&amp;H.</li>
            <li> excellent product especially considering the low price. the adage &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t apply in this case.</li>
            <li> Palmolive is a classic and you can&#x27;t go wrong. Nothing fancy about the scent or the product. Creates a very good lather and aids in a great wet shave. If you&#x27;re the type who likes simplicity or prefer sticks over tubs/creams, I would definitely recommend both Palmolive and Arko shave sticks.</li>
            <li> This is a very good budget product.  A good lather can be generated quite easily.  However, the stick does not have a holder, and storage is a bit of an issue so its not the best of sticks for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer to use it as a soap, grating and pressing a couple of sticks into a bowl.  If you want a better lather, super lather it with the matching Palmolive cream.</li>
            <li> The recommended way to use this product is to rub it over your wet beard and then take a brush and lather up.  The first time I used it, it seemed like very little was getting on my face.  However, after I applied the brush, a thick lather began to develop, and the more I swirled the more lather appeared.  Two passes later, the brush was still loaded up and I had to rinse a lot of it down the sink.  The lather is slick and thick, just what I was looking for.  I like the smell as well, and the price for this stick is very reasonable.  I wouldn&#x27;t mind using this as my everyday soap.  Another positive is that the airport security folks will pass this through.  I recently flew internationally and had no trouble with any security checks.  Great for travel.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. A close second to Arko</li>
            <li> The best shave soap ever!!!&lt;br /&gt;Just rub on the face let you beard pull off the ammount of soap needed, use a wet shave brush to make the lather right on your face. This soap makes shaving a joy! Even with the junk cartridge razors most people use. Do yourself and your face a favor and learn how to shave with a Double Edge Safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will thank me and yourself if you try this soap and a vintage razor!</li>
            <li> Good stuff. VERY cheap if you buy from Amazon. You just have to wait a couple weeks or so to get it, so plan accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arko lathers easier than this and also seems a bit &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34; so I gave this 4 stars and arko 5 stars, mainly considering what you get for the price. Either way, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaving soap. Just rub it over your damp beard and lather with your brush, then shave. I love the aroma and get slick, smooth shaves. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the price, it is inexpensive and will last a for many shaves. The quality of the lather is as good or better than more expensive products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a stick guy, but this stuff is great.</li>
            <li> I had read about shave sticks online and was intrigued. After I read more about how to use them, I ordered one. I used my Palmolive shave stick and got a great shave the first time!  The Palmolive shave stick is a high quality hard soap. The lather dries on the face, so maybe the only thing to remember is to keep adding hot water to your shaving brush and reapplying so the lather stays wet.  Too bad this product cannot be found in grocery stores and drug stores as with other shaving products, and must be ordered.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different soaps and creams. Palmolive is pretty good, but I was surprised by how small the stick is. It smells ok, performs fine., just a matter of personal preference I guess.</li>
            <li> One of my always-haves.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and great for air travel carry on. Wet your whiskers, wet the end of the stick, rub it in, and use a wet finger to make a lather.  Smooth shave, and the stick lasts a long time.  Smells manly, too!</li>
            <li> This is a fine soap. It is so easy to use and makes tons of lather. The price is right too. I like using shave sticks just to mix things up a bit instead of using a lather bowl. Just rub the soap on your wet face and take a wet brush to it and you have loads of lather in a few seconds. If you travel it&#x27;s perfect too. Doesn&#x27;t take up much room or weight. I like Arko a little better but this is right behind it.</li>
            <li> My favorite shave stick I have tried.  I like the scent, it is much better then Arko.  The scent is hard to describe but very soapy evergreen type of scent.  Also I think the palm oil in it provides plenty of lubrication.</li>
            <li> Smooth, slick, provides plenty of cushion.  Not the best scent, but it will continue to be a product I enjoy!</li>
