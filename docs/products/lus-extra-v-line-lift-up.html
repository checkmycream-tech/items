    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>i was thinking \\&quot;yeaah its working!!\\&quot; lol.</li>
            <li>loved this product.</li>
            <li>Works really good, I like it</li>
            <li>It was ok !</li>
            <li>I stand by my honest evaluation.  </li>
            <li>I always liked this material for holding my CD player and it made a nice belt and now even boots are made of it because it is warm on the skin.</li>
            <li>It works very good, slimming the lower face and neck from the first use, will buy it again</li>
            <li>good luck to the others who are willing to try it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this seller, fast shipping and awesome product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Headband: Rather easy to put on</li>
            <li>I purchased this product first from the manufacturing company website, i really liked it, when i found it at amazon</li>
            <li>The neoprene was quite comfortable.</li>
            <li>Firstly, it was shipped VERY quickly!</li>
            <li>In the first use the product does burn and get itchy, but the next time is significantly better so don&#x27;t be scared of it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not horrible enough for surgery...</li>
            <li>It made my face feel hot.  </li>
            <li>The first time i wore it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product: I have seen short term effects of obtaining a more prominent jaw line (though mine is already somewhat prominent) and only slight effects in decreasing cheek fat.</li>
            <li>These good as long as your wearing them but as soon as you remove them everything drops back into place.</li>
            <li>Yes it does help, but to a certain degree.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to clean at least with just some soap and water after each use.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work for me</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>(Which were very visible after 1 application!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It tones and tightens that area, but I felt that the other things I&#x27;ve been doing (exercise, face creams, drinking a ton of water, etc) did more than this.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have the black part not against your face-</li>
            <li>and I think you could do the same but BETTER using any elastic type thing,  like the things you wrap ankles with that cost far less.  </li>
            <li>This thing works but only to a certain point.</li>
            <li>Secondly, I tried it for the first time last night, and I definately saw an improvement.</li>
            <li>and I was really surprised to see that it actually worked!!!</li>
            <li>The effects do not last over a day or two, but I have not used it regularly enough to tell whether it has long term effects over a certain period of regular use.</li>
            <li>Thus I conclude that this is a useless and non-working item that no one should purchase in hopes of firming up neck and jaw,  especially when there are FAR better things out there (like DMAE plus said elastics,  </li>

            <li> this does not work at all,  and if you want temporary tightening since nothing like this works in short OR long term,  try DMAE or tightening caffeine creams with moisturizing ability and a wrap from the pharmacy  (costs about five dollars,  </li>
            <li> well the second time i used it there was just slight tingling.</li>
            <li> I am Having trouble with the V-Line Lift (which goes under my chin etc., My V-Line Lift is slightly different from the V-Line Lift in the demonstration on the Video!</li>
            <li> Please listen carefully:  </li>
            <li> I use it without the wet paper liner that is sold with it.</li>
            <li> Theres not much of a difference.</li>
            <li> I got a chin lift and no more double chin.</li>
            <li> I think,  used to wrap ankles and other body parts.)  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically only going to tighten and firm small amounts of sag for those who still produce moderate/high amounts of collagen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The chin strap is not comfortable and does not fit every face size.</li>
            <li> I ordered this hoping it would firm up my jaw and neck.  </li>
            <li> That little sag!</li>
            <li> (has yet to do so at least).</li>
            <li> I find the liner to be cold and sloppy wet and adds nothing to the value of the chin up device.</li>
            <li> My face is slimmer, but I kept the mask on for 4 hours, not sure if that&#x27;s any dangerous</li>
            <li> so I hope no one is as dumb as me and buys it ever again!   </li>
            <li> but unfortunately it did not.</li>
            <li> for example)  rather than this useless mask.  </li>
            <li> But I hate  to wear it because It&#x27;s not comfortable</li>
            <li> Buying this should be illegal!</li>
            <li> It was very difficult to figure out how to use it</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Instructions: The instructions on this were not quite obvious to me immediately and I ended up putting the headband on inside out! Make sure you have the black part not against your face- it should be facing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Headband: Rather easy to put on but it always feels like it will slip off my head (has yet to do so at least). It is very easy to clean at least with just some soap and water after each use. You can still use glasses with the headband because it has ear holes! Which makes it great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product: I have seen short term effects of obtaining a more prominent jaw line (though mine is already somewhat prominent) and only slight effects in decreasing cheek fat. The effects do not last over a day or two, but I have not used it regularly enough to tell whether it has long term effects over a certain period of regular use. In the first use the product does burn and get itchy, but the next time is significantly better so don&#x27;t be scared of it!</li>
            <li> My face is slimmer, but I kept the mask on for 4 hours, not sure if that&#x27;s any dangerous but I did it and it works. I highly recommend this seller, fast shipping and awesome product.</li>
            <li> Have not seen any improvement. The chin strap is not comfortable and does not fit every face size. I would not recommend</li>
            <li> I am Having trouble with the V-Line Lift (which goes under my chin etc., My V-Line Lift is slightly different from the V-Line Lift in the demonstration on the Video!</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work for me but unfortunately it did not. good luck to the others who are willing to try it.</li>
            <li> Do not use the solution inside b/c I got rashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product to help define my v- line. Yes it does help, but to a certain degree. It tones and tightens that area, but I felt that the other things I&#x27;ve been doing (exercise, face creams, drinking a ton of water, etc) did more than this.</li>
            <li> loved this product. I got a chin lift and no more double chin. Really works.</li>
            <li> its not working at all</li>
            <li> I ordered this hoping it would firm up my jaw and neck.  It comes with some moisturizing type sheets and something that looks like a diving mask.  It was very difficult to figure out how to use it and I think you could do the same but BETTER using any elastic type thing,  like the things you wrap ankles with that cost far less.  Thus I conclude that this is a useless and non-working item that no one should purchase in hopes of firming up neck and jaw,  especially when there are FAR better things out there (like DMAE plus said elastics,  for example)  rather than this useless mask.  I stand by my honest evaluation.  This is literally the most silly thing and I am embarrassed I bought it,  so I hope no one is as dumb as me and buys it ever again!   Please listen carefully:  this does not work at all,  and if you want temporary tightening since nothing like this works in short OR long term,  try DMAE or tightening caffeine creams with moisturizing ability and a wrap from the pharmacy  (costs about five dollars,  I think,  used to wrap ankles and other body parts.)  Buying this should be illegal!</li>
            <li> I always liked this material for holding my CD player and it made a nice belt and now even boots are made of it because it is warm on the skin. I like the lift up as it feels like it is helping to keep my skin from sagging under my chin. I use it without the wet paper liner that is sold with it. I find the liner to be cold and sloppy wet and adds nothing to the value of the chin up device.</li>
            <li> My gobbler has always bothered me. I lost 90lbs and it was still there. That little sag! It&#x27;s not horrible enough for surgery...so I tried this. Firstly, it was shipped VERY quickly! Secondly, I tried it for the first time last night, and I definately saw an improvement. The neoprene was quite comfortable. I would have left it on longer than 40 minutes, but I was eager to see the results. (Which were very visible after 1 application!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product will not get rid of adipose tissue. It&#x27;s basically only going to tighten and firm small amounts of sag for those who still produce moderate/high amounts of collagen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Staying properly hydrated, avoiding smoking/alcohol and keeping your face moisturized (w/spf) is going to help maintain any results you may get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again!</li>
            <li> It was ok ! It made my face feel hot.  But I hate  to wear it because It&#x27;s not comfortable</li>
            <li> I purchased this product first from the manufacturing company website, i really liked it, when i found it at amazon i made another purchase. It works very good, slimming the lower face and neck from the first use, will buy it again</li>
            <li> This thing works but only to a certain point. Theres not much of a difference. The first time i wore it i had a burning sensation and i was thinking \\&quot;yeaah its working!!\\&quot; lol. well the second time i used it there was just slight tingling. and now i feel nothiiing. When i run out of chin masks i still plan to use errrm the  velcrow head wrap?? idk what its called.</li>
            <li> These good as long as your wearing them but as soon as you remove them everything drops back into place. What was I thinking.</li>
            <li> I found this on a japanese website and watched a youtube video on how to use it before I came on amazon to purchase. Once the item arrived I tried out one and I was really surprised to see that it actually worked!!!</li>
            <li> Works really good, I like it</li>
