    <ol>
            <li>Wonderstruck has the perfect amount of everything.</li>
            <li>Very good buy!</li>
            <li>but it is the best smelling one I have ever had</li>
            <li>The perfume is wonderful! !!!!</li>
            <li>She was happy with this and the smell is wonderful and not over powering.  </li>
            <li>It smells great and perfect size to carry in a purse.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my friend and she loved it!</li>
            <li>but it works just as good as perfume that sprays!</li>
            <li>the Roll-On is great to control the application.  </li>
            <li>I recommend spray on kind!</li>
            <li>My daughter just loved this gift.</li>
            <li>i feel like I smell good without knocking anyone out too.  </li>
            <li>My daughter loves ANYTHING TAYLOR, so I thought I would try to please her for Christmas and actually pleased us both!</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>Smells very nice, easy to use.</li>
            <li>She liked it, so I guess that&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance</li>
            <li>It also smells nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not in a nice fancy bottle with the charms around the top.</li>
            <li>It has been many years since I have gone head over</li>
            <li>granddaughters favorite scent</li>
            <li>Most perfumes give me a headache within twenty minutes of wearing them but this one doesnt.  </li>
            <li>It is shaped more like a roll on lip gloss.  </li>
            <li>Love the fragrance though.</li>
            <li>My husband says Enchanting is more fruity overtone, and I think Wonderstruck at times has an alcohol/chemical undertone.</li>
            <li>Also, to me, Enchanting just feels more sexy and grown up than this one.</li>
            <li>love taylor swift and hoped it would be a love</li>
            <li>I love this scent i get it every year for my grandaughters birthday .</li>
            <li>It is such a perfect &amp;#34;Scent&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I actually Love the perfume as well and have borrowed it on occasion when I have forgotten my perfume in the morning, on the way to School:-)</li>
            <li>If you like light fragrances, you need to buy this!</li>
            <li>\\&quot; Absolutely love the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps the favorite gift I gave my granddaughter.</li>
            <li>I love the smell</li>
            <li>Thanks Taylor!!!!</li>
            <li>Unlike much teen idol merchandise, this parfum is pleasant to smell, easy to use and a good value.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this perfume, it doesn&#x27;t have a very sweet smell and is not too strong.</li>
            <li>to carry on my purse and put it on really quick!</li>
            <li>My daughters are HUGE Taylor Swift Fans.  </li>
            <li>They got their money, that&#x27;s what is really important.  </li>
            <li>Compared to the mall prices I feel comfortable with this price.  </li>
            <li>it is a light scent</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t find the small size in stores so this was perfect.</li>
            <li>Not to mention its a cute, small, simple bottle, perfect for my daughter.</li>
            <li>It has a fresh, spring-like scent that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>It smells so light, fresh and has a clear clean scent.</li>
            <li>Although both companies are aware of the problem, neither has done anything to correct it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very girly!</li>
            <li>This perfume is stellar.</li>
            <li>They are both relatively cheap in a rollerball packaging, so do what I did and buy both if you&#x27;re not sure. :)</li>
            <li>did not like the perfume as much as i hoped.</li>
            <li>My older Daughter received this in her Stocking.  </li>
            <li>But upon further consideration have decided it was most likely legitimate.</li>
            <li>It does not come across as too strong for a young lady to wear (as long as She doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;bathe&amp;#34; in it, or anything...)</li>
            <li>but was surprised when I received it...</li>
            <li>Smells really good, but it&#x27;s pretty faint and doesn&#x27;t last long in the roller ball form.</li>
            <li>This is not a pretty little bottle of Taylor Swift perfume your TS fan will love.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize the product was only the small roll on when I purchased it, but it was affordable and it was for my daughter who enjoyed it none the less</li>

            <li> The same thing happened to me with Sephora. I bought what I thought was a bottle of purfume for my grandaughter, what I got was a little tube. This is dishonest and false advertising. They blamed Amazon for running the wrong picture. Although both companies are aware of the problem, neither has done anything to correct it. What are you going to do 3 days before Christmas. Two classless companies. They got their money, that&#x27;s what is really important.  Takpro</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize the product was only the small roll on when I purchased it, but it was affordable and it was for my daughter who enjoyed it none the less</li>
            <li> I ordered this for niece for Christmas, showed up today , Dec. 23. Opened it only to find out it is not what is shown in the picture. It&#x27;s not in a nice fancy bottle with the charms around the top. It&#x27;s in a plain, boring purple tube! So disappointed that I now need to go shopping for something else for my niece, 2 days before Christmas.</li>
            <li> Received product in an envelope with no padding smashed to splinters. I was terribly disappointed that a glass pkg product would be shipped like this.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my friend and she loved it! Couldn&#x27;t find the small size in stores so this was perfect.</li>
            <li> It has been many years since I have gone head over heals about a scent. Wonderstruck has the perfect amount of everything. It has a fresh, spring-like scent that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I am extremely picky about perfumes. The only one I have been using was Can Can by Paris Hilton. I absolutely LOVE this perfume, it doesn&#x27;t have a very sweet smell and is not too strong. It&#x27;s very girly! &amp;lt;3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to carry on my purse and put it on really quick!</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my son&#x27;s girlfriend. It was OVERPRICED for the 0.33oz ROLL ON bottle that it came in. She liked it, so I guess that&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
            <li> Unlike much teen idol merchandise, this parfum is pleasant to smell, easy to use and a good value.  My daughter loves ANYTHING TAYLOR, so I thought I would try to please her for Christmas and actually pleased us both!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for our daughter.  She was happy with this and the smell is wonderful and not over powering.  Compared to the mall prices I feel comfortable with this price.  I will be making another purchase as a birthday gift.[[ASIN:9788072100 Taylor Swift Wonderstruck Perfume for Women 0.33 oz Eau De Parfum Rollerball]]</li>
            <li> I choose the roller ball for the controlled dispense. Not to mention its a cute, small, simple bottle, perfect for my daughter.</li>
            <li> My daughter just loved this gift. It smells great and perfect size to carry in a purse. Very good buy!</li>
            <li> Be careful.  This is not a pretty little bottle of Taylor Swift perfume your TS fan will love.  It&#x27;s a little \\&quot;stick.\\&quot;  Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> Smells really good, but it&#x27;s pretty faint and doesn&#x27;t last long in the roller ball form. I recommend spray on kind!</li>
            <li> granddaughters favorite scent</li>
            <li> Most perfumes give me a headache within twenty minutes of wearing them but this one doesnt.  it is a light scent but it is the best smelling one I have ever had and I absolutely love it!  i feel like I smell good without knocking anyone out too.  Cant give it enough praise!</li>
            <li> I thought the picture was going to be what the product actually looked like but instead it came in a little tube and I was very disappointed. I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and even though she loved the smell, she was also disappointed in the size and shape compared to the picture.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance but was surprised when I received it... it looks nothing like the photo.  It is shaped more like a roll on lip gloss.  Love the fragrance though.</li>
            <li> The roll on .33 oz Eau De Parfum is actually a tube. The packaging that I received for this item does not match this picture.</li>
            <li> The packing is well constructed, and the perfume applies evenly, but out of Wonderstruck and Taylor Swift&#x27;s Enchanting, I prefer the Enchanting.  My husband says Enchanting is more fruity overtone, and I think Wonderstruck at times has an alcohol/chemical undertone. Also, to me, Enchanting just feels more sexy and grown up than this one. They are both relatively cheap in a rollerball packaging, so do what I did and buy both if you&#x27;re not sure. :)</li>
            <li> did not like the perfume as much as i hoped. love taylor swift and hoped it would be a love</li>
            <li> I love this scent i get it every year for my grandaughters birthday . I get the roll on so she can carry it in her purse and no spills and one for her dresser</li>
            <li> My daughters are HUGE Taylor Swift Fans.  My older Daughter received this in her Stocking.  It is such a perfect &amp;#34;Scent&amp;#34;.  It does not come across as too strong for a young lady to wear (as long as She doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;bathe&amp;#34; in it, or anything...) so the Roll-On is great to control the application.  I actually Love the perfume as well and have borrowed it on occasion when I have forgotten my perfume in the morning, on the way to School:-)</li>
            <li> This perfume is stellar. I got an email when it was shipped out about a day after it was ordered and it arrived about two or three days later! It is a roller ball but it works just as good as perfume that sprays! It also smells nice. If you like light fragrances, you need to buy this!</li>
            <li> Smells very nice, easy to use.</li>
            <li> The perfume is wonderful! !!!!\\&quot; Absolutely love the fragrance.  I get compliments all the time. It smells so light, fresh and has a clear clean scent. Thanks Taylor!!!!</li>
            <li> Perhaps the favorite gift I gave my granddaughter. Now I just hope she doesn&#x27;t find out I hung up on the disc jockey voiced guy who called at 10:15 p.m. to tell me I had won Taylor Swift tickets. I didn&#x27;t believe him. But upon further consideration have decided it was most likely legitimate.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and I recommend this.</li>
