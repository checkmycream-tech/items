            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I love the flavor, and looking at the ingredients I feel</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I was still able to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Most greens have like a muddy flavor this does not at all.</li>
            <li>I will reorder again , and enjoyed doing business with you.</li>
            <li>Best tasting greens that supports daily nutritional needs, vegetarian, no preservatives.</li>
            <li>my digestion better.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t have the sweetness I think i could handle it better.</li>
            <li>You can always add more water and/or ice cubes and this will not reduce the effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>This product more than met my expectations...  </li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>I have so much more energy.  </li>
            <li>taste much better than most.</li>
            <li>I love to mix this with my Spirulina and Chlorella.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>This one definitely has the best taste to me, it also blends well and finishes with no granules in the bottom of the cup and no after taste.  </li>
            <li>but this is the next best thing.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I have bought more and will continue.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s better than nothing at all in my system.</li>
            <li>I feel it helps with fibromyalgia, Interstitial Cystitis and probably more.</li>
            <li>I find that mixing Delicious Greens 8000 with a glass of grape juice makes a lovely supper when eaten with a few good nut meats.  </li>
            <li>I love the sparking feeling I feel as I drink it.  </li>
            <li>So I love the taste of this product and have been drinking it for years...</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years now and I always start my morning with it.</li>
            <li>so I opt for this healthy choice.</li>
            <li>Greens 8000 is an easy way to get all those nutrients that most of us miss because we cannot eat the pound of vegetables a day that it would take to get them.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t start a single day without my Delicious Greens.  </li>
            <li>It makes it all taste really good and what a super drink to drink in the morning, just full of nutrition.</li>
            <li>Great so far.</li>
            <li>Greens world states the product accurately.</li>
            <li>I put this in my morning smoothly</li>
            <li>Tastes very good not like other greens</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave any funny taste in my mouth and it&#x27;s given me more energy.</li>
            <li>Both the berry and the original taste</li>
            <li>They are sweet and give me that wonderful green energy I enjoy so much!  </li>
            <li>I add a scoop to my smoothie in the morning,  I make a large smoothing for my family, 4 kids, and they all love the taste of this stuff.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok, mixes well, but has a minty sweet taste to it which doesn&#x27;t really go with juice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, don&#x27;t expect to be full afterwards</li>
            <li>Some people say it is too sweet</li>
            <li>For me, I&#x27;d rather have a chalky taste in the powder than the weirdly sweet, chemical-like flavor that comes with this stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy; it tastes good just mixed with water; the price is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>can you believe that.................it is super with lots of super foods.  </li>
            <li>I would like more vitamin info on the back it must have more</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>They can be mixed with soy milk, almond milk, juices or just water and have such a great taste!!!</li>
            <li>If you are one of those, then you REALLY NEED to be using this wonderful Green product.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the taste on its own, just mixed in water.</li>
            <li>This is a very good quality product that is comparable to any other brand and at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li>Dynamic Greens by Nutri-Dyn has the certifications and pharmaceutical quality controls and organic ingredients which is worth more money in trust to me, but you will pay more.</li>
            <li>Too much hype in the promotion compared to immediate benefits received&lt;br /&gt;I will be better prepared to advise and comment after the first 30 days of use.&lt;br /&gt;Fred</li>
            <li>Tastes great, ignore the green color.....................</li>
            <li>I love that my 18 and 21 year old sons use it at college.  </li>
            <li>Plenty of antioxidants and nutrients that&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li>definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I like real healthy green taste.</li>
            <li>so I purchase the handy chocolate or original green packets.</li>
            <li>I feel so much better on this mixed in with my pea protein.  </li>
            <li>Most likely from the fruit and stevia ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Due to my own negligence, I ran out of my greens for about two weeks.</li>
            <li>One thing I&#x27;ve found fairly common is that some taste better than others; most don&#x27;t blend well and leave an after taste.</li>
            <li>I prefer live, fresh juice</li>
            <li>The taste is OK- the company is not very transparent when I did a pretty thorough check on them.</li>
            <li>Although this tasted a little better than most greens I have had, it still feel short on taste.  </li>
            <li>I am a flight attendant</li>
            <li>I have never tired of the taste.</li>
            <li>My whole family swears by this product.  </li>
            <li>I feel there is to much stevia in it.</li>
            <li>Too soon to tell much difference yet.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know how it works, but it gives me energy.  </li>
            <li>I thought that the taste was way, way better than expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used a second serving later in the day for extra needed energy and it works great for me</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried a lot of green drinks but this one has a nice mint taste to it.</li>
            <li>I have tried a few other greens products, and this by far is the best.</li>
            <li>Not necessarily a favorite drink, but certainly drinkable on its own.</li>
            <li>The product tastes better than any other of its type.  </li>
            <li>Tastes great alone - mixed with cold water for a refreshing drink by itself.  </li>
            <li>Everyone looks at green drinks and makes a face and says BLECH - but this is DELICIOUS and good for you.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps too much fillers as far as apple pectin etc.</li>
            <li>The flavors that are added -- mint, citrus, and far to much stevia -- seem to accentuate the nastiness of this product rather than complement or mask it.</li>
            <li>My 7 year old son drinks this without too much fuss.</li>
            <li>When I travel, I simply put a packet in a large bottle with water and shake it up.</li>
            <li>Gives me all of the natural energy I need.</li>
            <li>It has probiotics, low sodium and mixes really well with a protein drink and fruit.  </li>
            <li>but i am a sensitive indidvidual, save your money</li>
            <li>wife keeps using it and reordering when she is nearly out</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different brands of green powder over the years.  </li>
            <li>She said the berry flavor is less sweet.</li>
            <li>I usually have to add fruit juice to other powders but this particular mix has a good taste when mixed with only water</li>
            <li>Making is a little sweet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the price was right compared to other products</li>
            <li>Most of these freeze dried green juices contain a lot of grasses like barley, wheat, etc.  </li>
            <li>It tastes a little minty and goes down easy.</li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t always eat right and am usually in a rush in the morning at a minimum I drink this in a bottle of water on the way to work daily.</li>

            <li> so I purchase the handy chocolate or original green packets.</li>
            <li> I feel so much better on this mixed in with my pea protein.  </li>
            <li> Most likely from the fruit and stevia ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Due to my own negligence, I ran out of my greens for about two weeks.</li>
            <li> One thing I&#x27;ve found fairly common is that some taste better than others; most don&#x27;t blend well and leave an after taste.</li>
            <li> I prefer live, fresh juice</li>
            <li> The taste is OK- the company is not very transparent when I did a pretty thorough check on them.</li>
            <li> Although this tasted a little better than most greens I have had, it still feel short on taste.  </li>
            <li> I am a flight attendant</li>
            <li> I have never tired of the taste.</li>
            <li> My whole family swears by this product.  </li>
            <li> I feel there is to much stevia in it.</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell much difference yet.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know how it works, but it gives me energy.  </li>
            <li> I thought that the taste was way, way better than expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used a second serving later in the day for extra needed energy and it works great for me</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried a lot of green drinks but this one has a nice mint taste to it.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few other greens products, and this by far is the best.</li>
            <li> Not necessarily a favorite drink, but certainly drinkable on its own.</li>
            <li> The product tastes better than any other of its type.  </li>
            <li> Tastes great alone - mixed with cold water for a refreshing drink by itself.  </li>
            <li> Everyone looks at green drinks and makes a face and says BLECH - but this is DELICIOUS and good for you.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps too much fillers as far as apple pectin etc.</li>
            <li> The flavors that are added -- mint, citrus, and far to much stevia -- seem to accentuate the nastiness of this product rather than complement or mask it.</li>
            <li> My 7 year old son drinks this without too much fuss.</li>
            <li> When I travel, I simply put a packet in a large bottle with water and shake it up.</li>
            <li> Gives me all of the natural energy I need.</li>
            <li> It has probiotics, low sodium and mixes really well with a protein drink and fruit.  </li>
            <li> but i am a sensitive indidvidual, save your money</li>
            <li> wife keeps using it and reordering when she is nearly out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different brands of green powder over the years.  </li>
            <li> She said the berry flavor is less sweet.</li>
            <li> I usually have to add fruit juice to other powders but this particular mix has a good taste when mixed with only water</li>
            <li> Making is a little sweet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the price was right compared to other products</li>
            <li> Most of these freeze dried green juices contain a lot of grasses like barley, wheat, etc.  </li>
            <li> It tastes a little minty and goes down easy.</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t always eat right and am usually in a rush in the morning at a minimum I drink this in a bottle of water on the way to work daily.</li>
            <li> My husband who is new to green drinks loves it.</li>
            <li> As a single parent I am always on the move and time runs short.</li>
            <li> If I miss a couple of days I start to drag.</li>
            <li> and whenever I forget to take it for a few days I notice a definite drop in my energy level.  </li>
            <li> I go especially during the winter when salads are not readily available.  </li>
            <li> So many reviewers gave this greens powder high ratings, but it tastes AWFUL.</li>
            <li> All others are disgusting, or are no where near are potent as this brand.</li>
            <li> I have purchased greens 8000 for two and a half years.</li>
            <li> I am then less stressed about eating well for the rest of the day but tend to eat well anyway.</li>
            <li> I needed to find a product that I could take on the go when I didn&#x27;t have time to eat a bunch of salads a day but still wanted the alkalizing benefits of green foods.  </li>
            <li> I did 2-3 servings everyday....</li>
            <li> I have tried many other greens powders that have found a way around the horrible taste problem, but this one doesn&#x27;t even come close.</li>
            <li> Almost didn&#x27;t try this due to negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> I drank it plain with 6-8oz of water.</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t have the grasses in it or at least it doesn&#x27;t make me itch.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s crazy.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This greens product has always been my favorite tasting greens drink of all time.</li>
            <li> Excellent price when you buy the two canister special. I put this in my morning smoothly so I get more veggies that I eat during the day.</li>
            <li> I have purchased greens 8000 for two and a half years. I have arthritis, lack of energy, and irritable bowel syndrome. Greens 8000 was a miracle for me. Due to my own negligence, I ran out of my greens for about two weeks. The pain started back up, my low energy returned, and lets just call my tummy, (the beast) returned. I am a flight attendant so I purchase the handy chocolate or original green packets. When I travel, I simply put a packet in a large bottle with water and shake it up. I have never tired of the taste. At home, I use a scoop of greens with a banana, ice, and milk in a blender and oh what a yummy shake.</li>
            <li> My whole family swears by this product.  I love that my 18 and 21 year old sons use it at college.  (They ask for more so I think I have proof - for parental skeptics such as myself!)  It tastes great in water, for me. The males of the family prefer OJ.  If I miss a couple of days I start to drag.</li>
            <li> Love all the &amp;#34;Delicious&amp;#34; Products. I like to use them in my morning smoothies for an extra boost of nutrients.</li>
            <li> A co-worker of mine recommended this product to me. I haven&#x27;t tried a lot of green drinks but this one has a nice mint taste to it. It doesn&#x27;t leave any funny taste in my mouth and it&#x27;s given me more energy. All things I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> Good product pretty good ingriendents. Perhaps too much fillers as far as apple pectin etc. But all organic. I feel there is to much stevia in it. Making is a little sweet. I like real healthy green taste. My husband who is new to green drinks loves it. So i will be buying more for him. I called the comp. which i might add it very nice and helpful. She said the berry flavor is less sweet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product! However, don&#x27;t expect to be full afterwards it&#x27;s not like a protein drink but this is a great base to make one.</li>
            <li> Good product and great minty taste.  I use it almost daily - sometimes just with water and sometimes I add it to my protein shake.</li>
            <li> Delicious Greens 8000 is THE BEST I&#x27;ve tasted. All others are disgusting, or are no where near are potent as this brand. I actually feel the difference after one cup! Gives me all of the natural energy I need. LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> This has an ORAC of 8000............can you believe that.................it is super with lots of super foods.  Tastes great, ignore the green color.....................I feel so much better on this mixed in with my pea protein.  Read my review on the Source Naturals Pea Protein which has no sugar and is wonderful.....................I mix it with this product for the best meal drink ever.</li>
            <li> Great! I am not the best at eating healthy so I drink one of these a day and I can feel the difference everytime.</li>
            <li> I love the flavor, and looking at the ingredients I feel like I get all the nutrients I need from this one drink. I&#x27;m glad I was still able to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Tastes very good not like other greens I have tried, a nice minty flavor easy to combine with water mixes well. I would like more vitamin info on the back it must have more then is mentioned. Helps give me my morning boost, sometimes I mix it with blueberry juice for the extra vitamins and energy. Most greens have like a muddy flavor this does not at all. I will reorder again , and enjoyed doing business with you.</li>
            <li> Best tasting greens that supports daily nutritional needs, vegetarian, no preservatives. It has probiotics, low sodium and mixes really well with a protein drink and fruit.  It&#x27;s a delicious way to get your greens in for the day.  Tastes great alone - mixed with cold water for a refreshing drink by itself.  This is a must have.</li>
            <li> Great so far. my digestion better. I need to take it longer to tell overall. I mix it with water and take every morning</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok, mixes well, but has a minty sweet taste to it which doesn&#x27;t really go with juice.&lt;br /&gt;If it didn&#x27;t have the sweetness I think i could handle it better.</li>
            <li> Delicious Greens 8000 has a very impressive ingredient list and is my favorite green drink.  I have been using it for over 6 years and have tried others but always stick with this one.  I think it tastes great and mixes very well with no clumping whatsoever!  The taste is a silky spearmint flavor.  Some people say it is too sweet but I do not think so.  Most likely from the fruit and stevia ingredients.  You can always add more water and/or ice cubes and this will not reduce the effectiveness.  I also like the fact that it is hypoallergenic and does not contain wheat grass which I am allergic to.  Plenty of antioxidants and nutrients that&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> The taste is OK- the company is not very transparent when I did a pretty thorough check on them. Dynamic Greens by Nutri-Dyn has the certifications and pharmaceutical quality controls and organic ingredients which is worth more money in trust to me, but you will pay more. If you want cheaper greens and fruits buy this. Not everyone can buy a Cadillac. I would buy it again however as a back up.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> This product more than met my expectations...  It is delicious, mixes easily....what better way to get all your nutrients than in a great tasting smoothie...  I love it...</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell much difference yet. Both the berry and the original taste OK.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was quick. Too much hype in the promotion compared to immediate benefits received&lt;br /&gt;I will be better prepared to advise and comment after the first 30 days of use.&lt;br /&gt;Fred</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t start a single day without my Delicious Greens.  It&#x27;s tasty &amp; delicious.  I will continue to order this product and order from this supplier.  They are great!</li>
            <li> This is one truly amazing product! Great taste and ever better feeling! I would recommend trying it out!  God bless!</li>
            <li> When I use Delicious Greens 8000 I have so much more energy.  The product tastes better than any other of its type.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several years now and whenever I forget to take it for a few days I notice a definite drop in my energy level.  I&#x27;m not a big veggie eater so this seems to make up for it.</li>
            <li> taste much better than most. I usually have to add fruit juice to other powders but this particular mix has a good taste when mixed with only water</li>
            <li> I feel these greens are at the top of my list for taste!  They are sweet and give me that wonderful green energy I enjoy so much!  They can be mixed with soy milk, almond milk, juices or just water and have such a great taste!!!</li>
            <li> I love to mix this with my Spirulina and Chlorella. It makes it all taste really good and what a super drink to drink in the morning, just full of nutrition. like a liquid vitamin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. For me, I&#x27;d rather have a chalky taste in the powder than the weirdly sweet, chemical-like flavor that comes with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Repeat customer. Good product, will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Would order it again....&lt;br /&gt;Berry flavor tastes good and mixes well with water&lt;br /&gt;the price was right compared to other products</li>
            <li> So many reviewers gave this greens powder high ratings, but it tastes AWFUL. I have tried many other greens powders that have found a way around the horrible taste problem, but this one doesn&#x27;t even come close. The flavors that are added -- mint, citrus, and far to much stevia -- seem to accentuate the nastiness of this product rather than complement or mask it. I&#x27;ll be sticking with the Trace Minerals Greens Pak, though I was hoping to find something in a bulk powder rather than individual packets.</li>
            <li> Almost didn&#x27;t try this due to negative reviews.  Glad I powered through and decided to try for myself.  I&#x27;ve used many different brands of green powder over the years.  One thing I&#x27;ve found fairly common is that some taste better than others; most don&#x27;t blend well and leave an after taste. This one definitely has the best taste to me, it also blends well and finishes with no granules in the bottom of the cup and no after taste.  This well be a recurring purchase for me. (Purchased off Amazon)</li>
            <li> It tastes great. But, leave it in the water for 10 minutes before drinking.</li>
            <li> I needed to find a product that I could take on the go when I didn&#x27;t have time to eat a bunch of salads a day but still wanted the alkalizing benefits of green foods.  Most of these freeze dried green juices contain a lot of grasses like barley, wheat, etc.  The grasses make me itch.  This stuff doesn&#x27;t have the grasses in it or at least it doesn&#x27;t make me itch.  I take some everywhere I go especially during the winter when salads are not readily available.  I prefer live, fresh juice but this is the next best thing.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I don&#x27;t really know how it works, but it gives me energy.  It tastes a little minty and goes down easy.</li>
            <li> This is a very good quality product that is comparable to any other brand and at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li> did not agree with me, this product did not agree with me but i am a sensitive indidvidual, save your money</li>
            <li> I thought that the taste was way, way better than expected. I drank it plain with 6-8oz of water. It seemed to give me a lift. I did 2-3 servings everyday.... I have bought more and will continue.</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t always eat right and am usually in a rush in the morning at a minimum I drink this in a bottle of water on the way to work daily. Can&#x27;t say it works but it&#x27;s better than nothing at all in my system.</li>
            <li> Not a greens fan, so the fact that I like it indicates this product is tasty.  I use it to supplement my low vegetable intake.  Greens world states the product accurately.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think I would like this at all, but the taste is very good. I&#x27;m not one who consumes veggies often, so if this product is what it claims to be, I will be very pleased.</li>
            <li> I love adding Delicious Greens to my veggie and fruit smoothie. I feel it helps with fibromyalgia, Interstitial Cystitis and probably more. It&#x27;s my investment in myself and definitely worth it. I just wish I could buy it in a larger container.</li>
            <li> Are you at optimal health? Me neither. That is why I use a product like Greens to get me going every morning. I am good about eating my fruits and vegetables, and most people are not. If you are one of those, then you REALLY NEED to be using this wonderful Green product.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it is amazing and arrived very quick</li>
            <li> wife keeps using it and reordering when she is nearly out</li>
            <li> I have tried a few other greens products, and this by far is the best. Both the flavor and the energy that I receive from these earn five stars.</li>
            <li> I add a scoop to my smoothie in the morning,  I make a large smoothing for my family, 4 kids, and they all love the taste of this stuff.  A bit pricey, but all the vegi powders are pricey.  This one tastes good and is a value.</li>
            <li> I find that mixing Delicious Greens 8000 with a glass of grape juice makes a lovely supper when eaten with a few good nut meats.  I didn&#x27;t take it to lose weight but I did.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> On the days when I drink my Delicious Greens 8000 Original Flavor in the morning, I eat better throughout the day. I enjoy the taste on its own, just mixed in water. Not necessarily a favorite drink, but certainly drinkable on its own. I am then less stressed about eating well for the rest of the day but tend to eat well anyway.</li>
            <li> Everyone looks at green drinks and makes a face and says BLECH - but this is DELICIOUS and good for you.  I love the sparking feeling I feel as I drink it.  Nothing compares - even in my juicer !</li>
            <li> My 7 year old son drinks this without too much fuss. As a single parent I am always on the move and time runs short. So this helps a great deal in making sure he gets a good bridg for all the greens he needs.</li>
            <li> So I love the taste of this product and have been drinking it for years... However in very tiny print I saw that there is a warning sign that says there is lead in the product and its banned in California for that reason. Why is there lead in a health food product is my question!!! That&#x27;s crazy.</li>
            <li> Great product. Taste is good and gives lots of energy. Feeling great</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years now and I always start my morning with it. I&#x27;ve also used a second serving later in the day for extra needed energy and it works great for me, I don&#x27;t tolerate caffeine well so I opt for this healthy choice.</li>
            <li> Greens 8000 is an easy way to get all those nutrients that most of us miss because we cannot eat the pound of vegetables a day that it would take to get them.  It&#x27;s easy; it tastes good just mixed with water; the price is very reasonable.  I totally recommend Greens 8000.  I&#x27;ve been taking it for several years now.</li>
            <li> Although this tasted a little better than most greens I have had, it still feel short on taste.  I just can&#x27;t do it....</li>
