            <li>Came quick too!</li>
            <li>This oil isn&#x27;t quite as strong as Now Foods, but it is pretty good considering how much money I saved!  </li>
            <li>The smell is amazing; pure lemon all the way.</li>
            <li>First of all let me say I am quite happy with this particular oil.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery, great smelling large bottle of lemon EO.</li>
            <li>I primarily use it in cleaning products.  </li>
            <li>The vendor is also very helpful and nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier than squeezing lemons in the morning for my warm lemon drink.  </li>
            <li>The generous size for the price is what I need to always have a bottle handy since I use it so much.</li>
            <li>All in all, I was glad to purchase this with a promotional coupon and now have a fresh smelling house.</li>
            <li>I am glad I found the product and am sure I will find more ways to use this natural fragrance.</li>

            <li>I enjoy the scent.</li>
            <li>It is great value for money and will last forever.</li>
            <li>I an always on the go and keeping fresh healthy options around is a goal of mine.</li>
            <li>Also use in the diffuser to make the house smell lemony fresh :)</li>
            <li>I put it on the light bulbs on my nightstands.</li>
            <li>Perfect for how much we use around the house, especially freshening the washing machine and garbage disposal!</li>
            <li>The smell is very fresh.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells pretty good and comes in a very generous size.</li>
            <li>I was excited to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>and I was really excited.</li>
            <li>love this Better Shea Butter 100% Essential Lemon oil for many reasons.  </li>
            <li>It added a light lemon fragrance without being too sweet or overpowering.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love my lemon essential oil!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to smell fresh lemon all around my home!</li>
            <li>Smells so fresh!  </li>
            <li>I was so excited when I received a coupon to order this oil.</li>
            <li>I am used to those itty bitty little bottles most oils came in, so that was a happy surprise.</li>
            <li>I decided to try making my own cleaning products and am glad that I purchased this essential oil.</li>
            <li>I will keep it since I am just using it to clean but will not reorder.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Delivery was quick and it was packaged securely.</li>
            <li>I have been using essential oils for a couple of years now, and this lemon oil has by far the best aroma.</li>
            <li>I have begun adding it to water in a spray bottle for a disinfectant to clean the kitchen.</li>
            <li>It is so freash and clean smelling.</li>
            <li>It has a nice lemon scent, though it is more antiseptic smelling than my DoTerra, which I like, especially for cleaning.</li>
            <li>I will be using it to clean with and in my laundry to add some freshness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this in my classroom to clean surfaces at end of day; Citrus Limonum is antiseptic, antimicrobial, and bactericidal.  </li>
            <li>I am new to essential oils, and find this very pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Love this pure lemon oil.</li>
            <li>With prime shipping it arrived right on time!</li>
            <li>it is just the right amount of citrus without being overbearing!</li>
            <li>I have so much control with the medicine dropper, and it screws right on top of the bottle for easy storage.  </li>
            <li>Super excited.</li>
            <li>It has a nice, crisp lemon scent which is very pleasing.</li>
            <li>Not that bright, uplifting lemony smell I was expecting (like you get with NOW or doTerra essential lemon oil).  </li>
            <li>That is why I started getting into making my own natural products  ---  cheaper, and</li>
            <li>So I give it 5 stars, the packaging was good, although the box could have been a bit larger to accommodate for the glass dropper, but, I&#x27;ll give them a pass on that because it INCLDUED A GLASS DROPPER!</li>
            <li>If you need a good lemon oil this is totally the way to go.</li>
            <li>now also has that light lemon fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>It is not a bad trade-off.</li>
            <li>The bottle is very large for the price and it has a very fresh clean smell to it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear and easy to read, but still cute to look at.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to be able to have a fresh, clean smell without worrying about harsh chemicals!</li>
            <li>It is by far a superior product compared to others I&#x27;ve used in the past (not to mention that the price was great).  </li>
            <li>It is not exactly what I thought it was, but it has a great aroma.</li>
            <li>Delivered fast and lemony fresh!!</li>
            <li>I have used it in my diffuser and it makes my house smell fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s uplifting &amp; smells clean &amp; fresh.</li>
            <li>The lemon makes everything smell so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>So fresh &amp; clean.  </li>
            <li>and I always want my house to smell fresh and clean-</li>
            <li>Essential oils are awesome, especially this lemon on!</li>
            <li>This bottle is waaaay bigger than any of the oils I have purchased locally so that was an awesome surprise.</li>
            <li>I like to put a few drops into baking soda and use it as a deodorizer for my carpets and area rugs, makes my whole house smell wonderful!</li>
            <li>Even though that&#x27;s the main reason I wanted this, I love that there are additional uses because it&#x27;s lemon and not a flower scent.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product hoping I would get lucky</li>
            <li>If you love lemon and essential oils, you&#x27;ll love this.  </li>
            <li>I primarily use it in my tea light oil burner, and whenever I open the door to my house it smells so lovely.</li>
            <li>Terrific scent and lemon oil has so many uses, great basic oil for a beginner.  </li>
            <li>very pleased with quality of this essential oil!</li>
            <li>It also goes great in vinegar that I use for wiping down my counters and floors.</li>
            <li>100% Lemon Oil is STRONG and if ingested, needs to be used very sparingly.  </li>
            <li>I use this oil daily, I love it!</li>
            <li>I just received my order of Lemon Essential Oil and I LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>brown bottle is nice, protects it from light, the label is pretty enough to keep the bottle displayed in your kitchen or bathroom.  </li>
            <li>It is strongly scented but so are many essential oils when you get them.</li>
            <li>What I first used this for was to help my brain overcome the fact that clean doesn&#x27;t have a smell.  </li>
            <li>Essential oils are simply amazing.</li>
            <li>It also comes with a convenient dropper for distinct measurements.  </li>
            <li>fresh scent</li>
            <li>it eliminates the odors and gives the clothes a fresh  smell  </li>
            <li>The scent is natural but potent enough to be effective.</li>
            <li>I use it to add a fresh scent to my laundry, but I&#x27;m also thinking about using it to make homemade cleaning products.</li>
            <li>I purchased the lemon oil as a natural flea deterrent for my pets and am quite pleased with the effects.</li>
            <li>I love all natural products.  </li>
            <li>my own!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already have a natural cleaning product I love</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like fresh lemons.</li>
            <li>When diluted or only using a few drops at a time, the scent is perfectly lemony fresh!</li>
            <li>This 100% pure oil has a clean, fresh scent that I diffuse with bergamot oil for energy and concentration.  </li>
            <li>Lemon essential oil is antibacterial, antibiotic, antiseptic, antiviral, and astringent...in other words it is the perfect cleaner.  </li>
            <li>So far... I have used this lemon oil as a very effective bathroom deoderizer, just a few drops in the toilet; works great..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive for any kind of smell but this oil is very natural with no chemicals added.</li>
            <li>but you read it right</li>
            <li>It really leaves a very pleasant scent for at least a couple of days.</li>
            <li>First of all this essential oil smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I am really big into using essential oils around my home for making all-natural beauty and home products and anything citrus is my all time favorite, especially lemon because it is incredibly versatile.  </li>
            <li>I also love this oil in a face mask and as a general pick-me-up in the morning or throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>The long glass stopper is really handy.  </li>
            <li>The long glass stopper is really handy.  </li>
            <li>I was able to purchase this lemon oil as part of a promotion, but the advertised price is extremely fair compared to other oils, and this will be the only lemon I buy from now on.</li>
            <li>I was delivered super fast and packaged to where it arrived in one piece which is always a plus.</li>
            <li>After using this to clean and refresh the house I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>it smells so natural fresh and so clean.</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of lemon oil, and many different brands, and this one, in my opinion, is right up there in quality and  kind of moves ahead of the pack due to</li>
            <li>There are so many benefits from essential oils.</li>
            <li>I love to use because my husband hates the smell of both the aforementioned oils.</li>
            <li>My husband has commented on how lovely the house smells after using the lemon essential oil!</li>
            <li>the smell is a real bonus!</li>
            <li>I love these essential oils.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE coffee with a drop or two in a cup, and I regularly mix it with water for use as a gargle with to freshen my breath.  </li>
            <li>Even though my first bottle was discounted, I will most definitely be buying this product again.  </li>
            <li>Even though my first bottle was discounted, I will most definitely be buying this product again.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>:B00OY6OGO2 Lemon Essential Oil by Better Shea Butter - 4 fl oz in Amber Glass Bottle with Dropper]]</li>
            <li>- it really is four ounces!</li>
            <li>Had to reorder, and will always come back here for more when I need.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Really like this company!</li>
            <li>I truly love this lemon essential oil and can&#x27;t imagine my household without it now that I&#x27;ve tried it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of lemon essential oil.</li>
            <li>It refreshes and renews my skin and gets rid of spots (as in age spots) - and FAST!</li>
            <li>Thanks !</li>
            <li>I had never tried using essential oils before, Im glad I chose this product.</li>
            <li>Shipping first, it was well packed and snug in the box, showing up on time.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>During the past year, I have discovered the wonderful benefits of essential oils.</li>
            <li>I love using a homemade disinfectant with vodka, lavender and lemon essential oils, and distilled water.  </li>
            <li>If you love lemon &amp; want an essential oil this is the product for you!!!</li>
            <li>It has such a bright taste and a fresh, clean smell, the possibilities for use are just about endless.</li>
            <li>I found that straight in the bottle it is a little strong, not unpleasant, but strong.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good quality dark glass bottle, the dropper works efficiently, and the oil itself seems a high grade.  </li>
            <li>Lemon is the main oil in all of our cleaning sprays, it works so well and everything has a fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>and it wouldn&#x27;t smell as fragrant as I&#x27;d liked when I was using lemon cleaning solution commercial product, but this takes the place and meets the needs to adding scents that are all natural to my batches.</li>
            <li>I use them in my favorite natural beauty recipes and some natural cleaning recipes too.</li>
            <li>Seems to be of high quality, no artificial or chemical smells.</li>
            <li>I have no affiliation with the company at all, and I am not required to leave a positive review.</li>
            <li>Nice quality oil in a dark jar with dropper.  </li>
            <li>I’ve used it in my diffusers to make the house smell refreshing and clean without a heavy smell.  </li>
            <li>The free dropper came in handy, and unlike some other &amp;#34;free droppers&amp;#34; I have received, this one actually fits the bottle and can be screwed on.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell may not be strong enough for others but because I apply it to my face and body</li>
            <li>Pure lemon oil.</li>
            <li>so I need pure, yummy scents.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased a lot of EO over the past few months and most were great,</li>
            <li>I made a batch with this oil along with a few drops of lavender, and my friends love it!  </li>
            <li>This lemon EO seems to be very high quality</li>
            <li>If you use it like I do, a large quantity is very much appreciated.  </li>
            <li>First, it is a very large bottle (compared to my Doterra essential oils), and the price is definitely right.  </li>
            <li>Second, this bottle is huge.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Very pleased...bought it twice</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s helpful if you need to really seal it up if you&#x27;re traveling or something.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very generous size and price.  </li>
            <li>All in all, I am very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>All in all, I am very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>Fantastic universal product.</li>
            <li>Packaged very well for shipping.</li>
            <li>I also really like that it came with a dropper that can screw on like a lid.</li>
            <li>I also really like the design of the label.</li>
            <li>Also, I really like the fact that it came with a dropper that attaches as a lid</li>
            <li>Fast delivery on time.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Really does.</li>
            <li>Thanks , Amazon.com</li>
            <li>in all, I think that this company really deserves a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li>too much can lead to damage -</li>
            <li>I really, really like the medicine dropper for the bottle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a very generously sized bottle.  </li>
            <li>It really freshens up my kitchen.  </li>
            <li>I have also used a little bit with my laundry to give it a fresh clean smell!</li>
            <li>I am also excited about learning about essential oils and their benefits!</li>
            <li>This lemon oil was recently offered at a reduced price through a promotion, so since I hadn&#x27;t tried lemon EO before, I was excited to order it.</li>
            <li>I have a variety of different oils and was totally excited to try lemon oil when my mom hooked me up with a promo code.</li>
            <li>Such a clean lemon sent.  </li>
            <li>cup water, 1/2 cup white vinegar, and 15 drops in a spray bottle and started to clean.  </li>
            <li>A glass dropper filled with Lemon Essential Oil, a drop of dish washing soap - to prevent stains - and a cup of water, all mixed together and sprayed, made our whole house smell of fresh lemons for days.</li>
            <li>I have used it in homemade cleaning products - a general cleaning spray and a toilet bowl cleaner, and it&#x27;s worked well and adds a nice, natural, non-chemical scent.  </li>
            <li>The scent is strong or harsh (as some reviews mentioned) if you sniff the bottle directly but once it is diluted in smaller quantities, it is a light fresh scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really did not realize how big a 4ox bottle really is!!</li>
            <li>Lemon has many benefits externally and internally.</li>
            <li>I was lucky to get this very BIG bottle at a promotional price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It came with a regular top and the dropper, and it&#x27;s a big bottle for the price.</li>
            <li>I used the lemon essential oil for so many different things.</li>
            <li>Most essential oils come in much smaller portions.</li>
            <li>All my other brands of essential oils have a top that is supposed to just let out a droplet of oil at a time; however, I end up wasting a bunch because once I get my 2-3 drops, another 2-3 come out before I can turn the bottle right side up.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Really high quality lemon oil.</li>
            <li>Lemon oil was high on the list.  </li>
            <li>As with many of the other reviews, I was quite surprised with the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised with how large the bottle is.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;m trying to continuously add new oils to what I already have, when I was lucky enough to get a coupon during a promotion I jumped at the chance to buy this oil.</li>
            <li>I drop a few drops in my garbarage disposal for a fresh clean smell as well.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what it says it is-  PURE Lemon Essential Oil.  </li>
            <li>This lemon essential oil is high quality, and the free glass dropper is such a helpful addition to help control how much oil you utilize.</li>
            <li>I love adding a few drops in my bath.  </li>
            <li>I do have to add that the fresh lemon scent not only brightens my house, but my mood as well.</li>
            <li>I did read on the label that it was for external use only which is fine with me since my main reason was for cleaning supplies.</li>
            <li>When this oil arrived I went right to the kitchen and mixed</li>
            <li>Smells super fresh and the 4 oz site will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li>This lemon essential oil is high quality, and the free included dropper is such a helpful addition.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this oil to anyone who is interested in giving essential oils a try!</li>
            <li>I also make my own carpet refresher with a few drops mixed with borax and baking soda.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve used it mainly to add to my homemade cleaning solutions</li>
            <li>Not as strong lemon oil as I am used to, but price is much less.  </li>
            <li>this particular lemon essential oil certainly does this.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time purchasing lemon essential oil</li>
            <li>We use essential oils as our first aid kit, cleaning supplies, etc.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>it is and smells natural!</li>
            <li>We have been using essential oils for cleaning since then, so I was so excited to be asked to try this lemon essential oil through a promotion and give my opinion.  </li>
            <li>First of all, four ounces is a *big* bottle!</li>
            <li>This is everything I expect from a high quality, pure essential oil.</li>
            <li>I also plan to make a mixture of vinegar and this oil to clean other surfaces.</li>
            <li>So easy to add a few drops to water and salads instead of dealing with produce.</li>
            <li>I was also positively surprise with the glass dropper, big plus for me since I stay away from plastics.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I put some down the disposal to clean it.</li>
            <li>you know, usually made up of chemicals, but our brains tell us it is clean!  </li>
            <li>Not so special like the one I get down the street at the health food store.</li>
            <li>Great value for a cold pressed oil.  </li>
            <li>I have used essential oils for a number of years and am absolutely sold on them.  </li>
            <li>We have young kids</li>
            <li>A real plus is that lemon essential oil is a known pick-you-up as you breathe it in and</li>
            <li>So far, I have used this oil in my diffuser which I keep in my kitchen.</li>
            <li>I put a few drops into a spray bottle with water and sprayed it lightly around my house</li>
            <li>I just brought 3 bottles so far.</li>
            <li>Because the price is so good I will not feel guilty at all about using it in every batch of laundry I do.  </li>
            <li>label was not applied smoothly - when it comes to my essential oils that is something I watch for very carefully.</li>
            <li>I mix with vinegar, water and a little hydrogen peroxide to clean my countertops and appliance fronts</li>
            <li>and I squeeze a few drops into my shampoo to help my clean hair shine without stripping it out.</li>
            <li>I have been using a few drop to clean my kitchen</li>
            <li>This lemon essential oil is the first essential oil I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It may work in cleaning products or in some capacity where the smell isn&#x27;t the main feature but for me, smell is key.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a high quality essential oil.</li>
            <li>A couple of drops on my wool dryer balls and the clothes come out lemon fresh with no static or harsh chemicals that actually make your clothes more flammable.</li>
            <li>I  ordered ivory Shea butter &amp; rosehip oil  from them earlier &amp;  looking forward for new products for my DIY projects from this company.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to start using essential oils in your daily routine I highly advise getting this today!</li>
            <li>I personally put a few drops into baking soda and sprinkle it onto the carpet overnight for fresh smelling carpets!  </li>
            <li>The only saving grace was that it brightened enough when paired with peppermint oil (I use both in my liquid hand soaps), which was my main purpose for purchasing it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased a few different varieties, but really consider myself a newbie to the whole world of EOs.</li>
            <li>When it arrived I was surprised at how big the bottle was!  </li>
            <li>I gave it four stars for what it is but would subtract one for the Amazon Product Description because the package label clearly says it is only for external use, which was a disappointment after having ordered it in large part because of the Product Description statement that &amp;#34;A few drops in a glass of water boosts your energy level, keeps you healthy, and tastes great.&amp;#34; The confusion seems to come from the source, though, as their own webpage description also suggests drinking a few drops in a glass of water to boost your immune system and fight off colds.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s about twice as big as the ones I usually buy, so I was really excited when I received it.  </li>
            <li>I usually buy Now Foods brand essential oils, but was running short on money and decided to go cheap.</li>
            <li>This cold pressed pure lemon essential oil has a clean, uplifting scent and very convenient glass dropper.</li>
            <li>I am 27 year old African American.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to get such a big bottle of Lemon oil with the promotion price.</li>
            <li>I use this essential oil in a fairly broad series of things.</li>
            <li>My husband was a little leery at first about having our clothes smell like lemon.</li>
            <li>A few more days have passed, and the changes haven&#x27;t been as dramatic as the first day, but it&#x27;s still shrinking in size.</li>
            <li>Instead of spraying harsh spray, I simply put the lemon in the diffuser and very quickly the room is smelling like I just wiped everything down with a lemon spray.</li>
            <li>I also swipe a little pure lemon oil on cuts to prevent infection, and I&#x27;ve used it to remove the gummy residue from labels and to remove oil stains from my laundry.  </li>
            <li>This pure lemon essential oil can be used by adding a few drops in a glass of water to boost your immune system and fight off colds.</li>

            <li> The vendor is also very helpful and nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much easier than squeezing lemons in the morning for my warm lemon drink.  </li>

            <li> It added a light lemon fragrance without being too sweet or overpowering.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love my lemon essential oil!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to smell fresh lemon all around my home!</li>
            <li> Smells so fresh!  </li>
            <li> I was so excited when I received a coupon to order this oil.</li>
            <li> I am used to those itty bitty little bottles most oils came in, so that was a happy surprise.</li>
            <li> I decided to try making my own cleaning products and am glad that I purchased this essential oil.</li>
            <li> I will keep it since I am just using it to clean but will not reorder.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Delivery was quick and it was packaged securely.</li>
            <li> I have been using essential oils for a couple of years now, and this lemon oil has by far the best aroma.</li>
            <li> I have begun adding it to water in a spray bottle for a disinfectant to clean the kitchen.</li>
            <li> It is so freash and clean smelling.</li>
            <li> It has a nice lemon scent, though it is more antiseptic smelling than my DoTerra, which I like, especially for cleaning.</li>
            <li> I will be using it to clean with and in my laundry to add some freshness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in my classroom to clean surfaces at end of day; Citrus Limonum is antiseptic, antimicrobial, and bactericidal.  </li>
            <li> I am new to essential oils, and find this very pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Love this pure lemon oil.</li>
            <li> With prime shipping it arrived right on time!</li>
            <li> it is just the right amount of citrus without being overbearing!</li>
            <li> I have so much control with the medicine dropper, and it screws right on top of the bottle for easy storage.  </li>
            <li> Super excited.</li>
            <li> It has a nice, crisp lemon scent which is very pleasing.</li>
            <li> Not that bright, uplifting lemony smell I was expecting (like you get with NOW or doTerra essential lemon oil).  </li>
            <li> That is why I started getting into making my own natural products  ---  cheaper, and</li>
            <li> So I give it 5 stars, the packaging was good, although the box could have been a bit larger to accommodate for the glass dropper, but, I&#x27;ll give them a pass on that because it INCLDUED A GLASS DROPPER!</li>
            <li> If you need a good lemon oil this is totally the way to go.</li>
            <li> now also has that light lemon fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> It is not a bad trade-off.</li>
            <li> The bottle is very large for the price and it has a very fresh clean smell to it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear and easy to read, but still cute to look at.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to be able to have a fresh, clean smell without worrying about harsh chemicals!</li>
            <li> It is by far a superior product compared to others I&#x27;ve used in the past (not to mention that the price was great).  </li>
            <li> It is not exactly what I thought it was, but it has a great aroma.</li>
            <li> Delivered fast and lemony fresh!!</li>
            <li> I have used it in my diffuser and it makes my house smell fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s uplifting &amp; smells clean &amp; fresh.</li>
            <li> The lemon makes everything smell so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> So fresh &amp; clean.  </li>
            <li> and I always want my house to smell fresh and clean-</li>
            <li> Essential oils are awesome, especially this lemon on!</li>
            <li> This bottle is waaaay bigger than any of the oils I have purchased locally so that was an awesome surprise.</li>
            <li> I like to put a few drops into baking soda and use it as a deodorizer for my carpets and area rugs, makes my whole house smell wonderful!</li>
            <li> Even though that&#x27;s the main reason I wanted this, I love that there are additional uses because it&#x27;s lemon and not a flower scent.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product hoping I would get lucky</li>
            <li> If you love lemon and essential oils, you&#x27;ll love this.  </li>
            <li> I primarily use it in my tea light oil burner, and whenever I open the door to my house it smells so lovely.</li>
            <li> Terrific scent and lemon oil has so many uses, great basic oil for a beginner.  </li>
            <li> very pleased with quality of this essential oil!</li>
            <li> It also goes great in vinegar that I use for wiping down my counters and floors.</li>
            <li> 100% Lemon Oil is STRONG and if ingested, needs to be used very sparingly.  </li>
            <li> I use this oil daily, I love it!</li>
            <li> I just received my order of Lemon Essential Oil and I LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li> brown bottle is nice, protects it from light, the label is pretty enough to keep the bottle displayed in your kitchen or bathroom.  </li>
            <li> It is strongly scented but so are many essential oils when you get them.</li>
            <li> What I first used this for was to help my brain overcome the fact that clean doesn&#x27;t have a smell.  </li>
            <li> Essential oils are simply amazing.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a convenient dropper for distinct measurements.  </li>
            <li> fresh scent</li>
            <li> it eliminates the odors and gives the clothes a fresh  smell  </li>
            <li> The scent is natural but potent enough to be effective.</li>
            <li> I use it to add a fresh scent to my laundry, but I&#x27;m also thinking about using it to make homemade cleaning products.</li>
            <li> I purchased the lemon oil as a natural flea deterrent for my pets and am quite pleased with the effects.</li>
            <li> I love all natural products.  </li>
            <li> my own!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already have a natural cleaning product I love</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like fresh lemons.</li>
            <li> When diluted or only using a few drops at a time, the scent is perfectly lemony fresh!</li>
            <li> This 100% pure oil has a clean, fresh scent that I diffuse with bergamot oil for energy and concentration.  </li>
            <li> Lemon essential oil is antibacterial, antibiotic, antiseptic, antiviral, and astringent...in other words it is the perfect cleaner.  </li>
            <li> So far... I have used this lemon oil as a very effective bathroom deoderizer, just a few drops in the toilet; works great..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive for any kind of smell but this oil is very natural with no chemicals added.</li>
            <li> but you read it right</li>
            <li> It really leaves a very pleasant scent for at least a couple of days.</li>
            <li> First of all this essential oil smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I am really big into using essential oils around my home for making all-natural beauty and home products and anything citrus is my all time favorite, especially lemon because it is incredibly versatile.  </li>
            <li> I also love this oil in a face mask and as a general pick-me-up in the morning or throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> The long glass stopper is really handy.  </li>
            <li> The long glass stopper is really handy.  </li>
            <li> I was able to purchase this lemon oil as part of a promotion, but the advertised price is extremely fair compared to other oils, and this will be the only lemon I buy from now on.</li>
            <li> I was delivered super fast and packaged to where it arrived in one piece which is always a plus.</li>
            <li> After using this to clean and refresh the house I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> it smells so natural fresh and so clean.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of lemon oil, and many different brands, and this one, in my opinion, is right up there in quality and  kind of moves ahead of the pack due to</li>
            <li> There are so many benefits from essential oils.</li>
            <li> I love to use because my husband hates the smell of both the aforementioned oils.</li>
            <li> My husband has commented on how lovely the house smells after using the lemon essential oil!</li>
            <li> the smell is a real bonus!</li>

            <li> :B00OY6OGO2 Lemon Essential Oil by Better Shea Butter - 4 fl oz in Amber Glass Bottle with Dropper]]</li>
            <li> - it really is four ounces!</li>
            <li> Had to reorder, and will always come back here for more when I need.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Really like this company!</li>
            <li> I truly love this lemon essential oil and can&#x27;t imagine my household without it now that I&#x27;ve tried it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of lemon essential oil.</li>
            <li> It refreshes and renews my skin and gets rid of spots (as in age spots) - and FAST!</li>
            <li> Thanks !</li>
            <li> I had never tried using essential oils before, Im glad I chose this product.</li>
            <li> Shipping first, it was well packed and snug in the box, showing up on time.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> During the past year, I have discovered the wonderful benefits of essential oils.</li>
            <li> I love using a homemade disinfectant with vodka, lavender and lemon essential oils, and distilled water.  </li>
            <li> If you love lemon &amp; want an essential oil this is the product for you!!!</li>
            <li> It has such a bright taste and a fresh, clean smell, the possibilities for use are just about endless.</li>
            <li> I found that straight in the bottle it is a little strong, not unpleasant, but strong.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good quality dark glass bottle, the dropper works efficiently, and the oil itself seems a high grade.  </li>
            <li> Lemon is the main oil in all of our cleaning sprays, it works so well and everything has a fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> and it wouldn&#x27;t smell as fragrant as I&#x27;d liked when I was using lemon cleaning solution commercial product, but this takes the place and meets the needs to adding scents that are all natural to my batches.</li>
            <li> I use them in my favorite natural beauty recipes and some natural cleaning recipes too.</li>
            <li> Seems to be of high quality, no artificial or chemical smells.</li>
            <li> I have no affiliation with the company at all, and I am not required to leave a positive review.</li>
            <li> Nice quality oil in a dark jar with dropper.  </li>
            <li> I’ve used it in my diffusers to make the house smell refreshing and clean without a heavy smell.  </li>
            <li> The free dropper came in handy, and unlike some other &amp;#34;free droppers&amp;#34; I have received, this one actually fits the bottle and can be screwed on.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell may not be strong enough for others but because I apply it to my face and body</li>
            <li> Pure lemon oil.</li>
            <li> so I need pure, yummy scents.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a lot of EO over the past few months and most were great,</li>
            <li> I made a batch with this oil along with a few drops of lavender, and my friends love it!  </li>
            <li> This lemon EO seems to be very high quality</li>
            <li> If you use it like I do, a large quantity is very much appreciated.  </li>
            <li> First, it is a very large bottle (compared to my Doterra essential oils), and the price is definitely right.  </li>
            <li> Second, this bottle is huge.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Very pleased...bought it twice</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s helpful if you need to really seal it up if you&#x27;re traveling or something.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very generous size and price.  </li>
            <li> All in all, I am very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> All in all, I am very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> Fantastic universal product.</li>
            <li> Packaged very well for shipping.</li>
            <li> I also really like that it came with a dropper that can screw on like a lid.</li>
            <li> I also really like the design of the label.</li>
            <li> Also, I really like the fact that it came with a dropper that attaches as a lid</li>
            <li> Fast delivery on time.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Really does.</li>
            <li> Thanks , Amazon.com</li>
            <li> in all, I think that this company really deserves a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> too much can lead to damage -</li>
            <li> I really, really like the medicine dropper for the bottle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a very generously sized bottle.  </li>
            <li> It really freshens up my kitchen.  </li>
            <li> I have also used a little bit with my laundry to give it a fresh clean smell!</li>
            <li> I am also excited about learning about essential oils and their benefits!</li>
            <li> This lemon oil was recently offered at a reduced price through a promotion, so since I hadn&#x27;t tried lemon EO before, I was excited to order it.</li>
            <li> I have a variety of different oils and was totally excited to try lemon oil when my mom hooked me up with a promo code.</li>
            <li> Such a clean lemon sent.  </li>
            <li> cup water, 1/2 cup white vinegar, and 15 drops in a spray bottle and started to clean.  </li>
            <li> A glass dropper filled with Lemon Essential Oil, a drop of dish washing soap - to prevent stains - and a cup of water, all mixed together and sprayed, made our whole house smell of fresh lemons for days.</li>
            <li> I have used it in homemade cleaning products - a general cleaning spray and a toilet bowl cleaner, and it&#x27;s worked well and adds a nice, natural, non-chemical scent.  </li>
            <li> The scent is strong or harsh (as some reviews mentioned) if you sniff the bottle directly but once it is diluted in smaller quantities, it is a light fresh scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really did not realize how big a 4ox bottle really is!!</li>
            <li> Lemon has many benefits externally and internally.</li>
            <li> I was lucky to get this very BIG bottle at a promotional price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It came with a regular top and the dropper, and it&#x27;s a big bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> I used the lemon essential oil for so many different things.</li>
            <li> Most essential oils come in much smaller portions.</li>
            <li> All my other brands of essential oils have a top that is supposed to just let out a droplet of oil at a time; however, I end up wasting a bunch because once I get my 2-3 drops, another 2-3 come out before I can turn the bottle right side up.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Really high quality lemon oil.</li>
            <li> Lemon oil was high on the list.  </li>
            <li> As with many of the other reviews, I was quite surprised with the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised with how large the bottle is.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;m trying to continuously add new oils to what I already have, when I was lucky enough to get a coupon during a promotion I jumped at the chance to buy this oil.</li>
            <li> I drop a few drops in my garbarage disposal for a fresh clean smell as well.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what it says it is-  PURE Lemon Essential Oil.  </li>
            <li> This lemon essential oil is high quality, and the free glass dropper is such a helpful addition to help control how much oil you utilize.</li>
            <li> I love adding a few drops in my bath.  </li>
            <li> I do have to add that the fresh lemon scent not only brightens my house, but my mood as well.</li>
            <li> I did read on the label that it was for external use only which is fine with me since my main reason was for cleaning supplies.</li>
            <li> When this oil arrived I went right to the kitchen and mixed</li>
            <li> Smells super fresh and the 4 oz site will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> This lemon essential oil is high quality, and the free included dropper is such a helpful addition.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this oil to anyone who is interested in giving essential oils a try!</li>
            <li> I also make my own carpet refresher with a few drops mixed with borax and baking soda.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used it mainly to add to my homemade cleaning solutions</li>
            <li> Not as strong lemon oil as I am used to, but price is much less.  </li>
            <li> this particular lemon essential oil certainly does this.  </li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing lemon essential oil</li>
            <li> We use essential oils as our first aid kit, cleaning supplies, etc.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> it is and smells natural!</li>
            <li> We have been using essential oils for cleaning since then, so I was so excited to be asked to try this lemon essential oil through a promotion and give my opinion.  </li>
            <li> First of all, four ounces is a *big* bottle!</li>
            <li> This is everything I expect from a high quality, pure essential oil.</li>
            <li> I also plan to make a mixture of vinegar and this oil to clean other surfaces.</li>
            <li> So easy to add a few drops to water and salads instead of dealing with produce.</li>
            <li> I was also positively surprise with the glass dropper, big plus for me since I stay away from plastics.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I put some down the disposal to clean it.</li>
            <li> you know, usually made up of chemicals, but our brains tell us it is clean!  </li>
            <li> Not so special like the one I get down the street at the health food store.</li>
            <li> Great value for a cold pressed oil.  </li>
            <li> I have used essential oils for a number of years and am absolutely sold on them.  </li>
            <li> We have young kids</li>
            <li> A real plus is that lemon essential oil is a known pick-you-up as you breathe it in and</li>
            <li> So far, I have used this oil in my diffuser which I keep in my kitchen.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops into a spray bottle with water and sprayed it lightly around my house</li>
            <li> I just brought 3 bottles so far.</li>
            <li> Because the price is so good I will not feel guilty at all about using it in every batch of laundry I do.  </li>
            <li> label was not applied smoothly - when it comes to my essential oils that is something I watch for very carefully.</li>
            <li> I mix with vinegar, water and a little hydrogen peroxide to clean my countertops and appliance fronts</li>
            <li> and I squeeze a few drops into my shampoo to help my clean hair shine without stripping it out.</li>
            <li> I have been using a few drop to clean my kitchen</li>
            <li> This lemon essential oil is the first essential oil I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It may work in cleaning products or in some capacity where the smell isn&#x27;t the main feature but for me, smell is key.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a high quality essential oil.</li>
            <li> A couple of drops on my wool dryer balls and the clothes come out lemon fresh with no static or harsh chemicals that actually make your clothes more flammable.</li>
            <li> I  ordered ivory Shea butter &amp; rosehip oil  from them earlier &amp;  looking forward for new products for my DIY projects from this company.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to start using essential oils in your daily routine I highly advise getting this today!</li>
            <li> I personally put a few drops into baking soda and sprinkle it onto the carpet overnight for fresh smelling carpets!  </li>
            <li> The only saving grace was that it brightened enough when paired with peppermint oil (I use both in my liquid hand soaps), which was my main purpose for purchasing it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a few different varieties, but really consider myself a newbie to the whole world of EOs.</li>
            <li> When it arrived I was surprised at how big the bottle was!  </li>
            <li> I gave it four stars for what it is but would subtract one for the Amazon Product Description because the package label clearly says it is only for external use, which was a disappointment after having ordered it in large part because of the Product Description statement that &amp;#34;A few drops in a glass of water boosts your energy level, keeps you healthy, and tastes great.&amp;#34; The confusion seems to come from the source, though, as their own webpage description also suggests drinking a few drops in a glass of water to boost your immune system and fight off colds.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s about twice as big as the ones I usually buy, so I was really excited when I received it.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy Now Foods brand essential oils, but was running short on money and decided to go cheap.</li>
            <li> This cold pressed pure lemon essential oil has a clean, uplifting scent and very convenient glass dropper.</li>
            <li> I am 27 year old African American.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to get such a big bottle of Lemon oil with the promotion price.</li>
            <li> I use this essential oil in a fairly broad series of things.</li>
            <li> My husband was a little leery at first about having our clothes smell like lemon.</li>
            <li> A few more days have passed, and the changes haven&#x27;t been as dramatic as the first day, but it&#x27;s still shrinking in size.</li>
            <li> Instead of spraying harsh spray, I simply put the lemon in the diffuser and very quickly the room is smelling like I just wiped everything down with a lemon spray.</li>
            <li> I also swipe a little pure lemon oil on cuts to prevent infection, and I&#x27;ve used it to remove the gummy residue from labels and to remove oil stains from my laundry.  </li>
            <li> This pure lemon essential oil can be used by adding a few drops in a glass of water to boost your immune system and fight off colds.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way because the lemon oil is very concentrated.</li>
            <li> Lemon Essential oil is a staple in my home and this 4oz jar won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> It came with a glass dropper, which I really appreciate since a little goes a very long way, and pouring can lead to disaster.</li>
            <li> Should last a long time.</li>
            <li> This bottle was purchased with a promotional code and will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> This will last me for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to put a few drops in a water bottle and use it as a linen spray - think of it as a natural deodorizer!  </li>
            <li> The size is larger than I expected and it will last me for long time!</li>
            <li> It is much larger than my other essential oil bottles.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the cap doesn&#x27;t fit on mine</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know exactly but not good.</li>
            <li> Much larger than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to venture out and try other essential oils.</li>
            <li> All of my other oils are in tiny ml bottles.</li>
            <li> We just add 1 drop to each of the 3 wool dryer balls after the clothes are dry.</li>
            <li> (I recently bought a new laptop after frying my old one and I was desperate for stress relief after spending hours trying get everything back where it belonged).  </li>
            <li> I use this product along with other oils to make poopoo spray that I spray in the toilet before i do my stinky business.</li>
            <li> You can use this lemon oil for so many things it&#x27;s impossible to list them here.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting a tiny (typical) bottle</li>
            <li> In some lesser quality oils I&#x27;ve used in the past the oil has left a greasy smudge.</li>
            <li> A small drop of this and then wash, the smell is completely gone (just be careful with using lemon oil and exposure to the sun...</li>
            <li> I have used it in water for a spray to freshen up the bathroom, and straight by putting a few drops on a dried up air freshener stick!  </li>
            <li> The lemon essential oil comes with a eyedropper that screws tightly onto the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Occasionally I will add this to my bath when I do other scents to help tone them down just a bit.</li>
            <li> its not real.</li>
            <li> I only put a few drops on it.</li>
            <li> These are just the ones I&#x27;ve used it for in the last few weeks.  </li>
            <li> With this essential oil I add a few drops to water in a spray bottle and use it as a cleaner for my furniture.  </li>
            <li> Arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> and I added just a few drops of lemon oil to my last batch</li>
            <li> Now I can add a few drops of this essential oil.  </li>
            <li> I have been putting it on a wet towel in the dryer.</li>
            <li> let sit a few minutes and vacuum.</li>
            <li> This lemon oil has a weird unpleasant smell, kind of like old rotting lemons.</li>
            <li> It has a convenient glass dropper for even application of the oil, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> This eyedropper is extremely helpful in portioning out the correct amount of drops.</li>
            <li> but I also found a lot of other uses for it as well</li>
            <li> I was told by other cat owners cat to not like lemon  </li>
            <li> I put it in my outside fountains and no more mosquitos.  </li>
            <li> Other than citrus oil can cause photo-sensitivity, so do not apply to skin before sun exposure</li>
            <li> I am used to my small essential oil bottles!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  looking at using it in other areas.</li>
            <li> Use as a cleaning product due to it&#x27;s antibacterial properties.</li>
            <li> I usually purchase Sparks Naturals lemon oil (I am a big fan of lemon).</li>
            <li> The regular brand of Lemon Essential oil it is indigestible - I was looking to find an alternate, less expensive option since I put it in my water often to aide in digestion.</li>
            <li> I’m also using on a rag to put in the dry as a dryer sheet, just a few drops does it.</li>
            <li> I usually make homemade wet mop refills for my Rubbermaid wet mop</li>
            <li> I use this on my fact and neck at least twice daily.</li>
            <li> Everything I have tried smells like cleaner and not a fresh squeezed lemon.</li>
            <li> Been incorporating essential oils into my routine lately</li>
            <li> I generally buy DoTerra brand essential oils, but I bought this one during a promotion to see how it stands up, because let&#x27;s face it, DoTerra is expensive.  </li>
            <li> I love to cook, but I hate the residual smell of garlic and onion on my hands.  </li>
            <li> I put some down the garbage disposal today after doing dishes and my kitchen smelled like I just cleaned it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a few other brands that undoubtedly had additives.</li>
            <li> I applied a drop of lemon oil to the wart &amp; after just one day, it shrunk to about half its size.</li>
            <li> This smells odd and doesn&#x27;t smell like lemon oil at all.....</li>
            <li> the price difference b/c I use so much less.</li>
            <li> The oil has a slight patchouli scent.</li>
            <li> I use it for a lot of things, including fragrance for rooms and myself, as well as my dogs (a tiny drop at the base of their neck on the fur, not the skin, keeps them smelling sooo fresh and does not irritate their skin).</li>
            <li> By the way, 30 drops equals half teaspoon.  </li>
            <li> and I have not a single complaint!</li>
            <li> I mix a few drops in a couple cups of filtered water in a spray bottle along with a splash of vinegar.  </li>
            <li> You can also put a few drops on a capsule and swallow it to boost your immune system as well.</li>
            <li> The smell is heavenly and I put a few drops in my coconut or almond oil before moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I shaker a few drops into my bath at night to help me relax</li>
            <li> Just pour a layer of baking soda in a container that has a lid, use a few drops of the lemon oil, pour another layer of baking soda and repeat until you have the amount you want then shake an sprinkle on carpet...</li>
            <li> I utilize oils in my everyday.</li>
            <li> My husband gagged after tasting a glass of water with a few drops in it.  </li>
            <li> I keep a bottle of this mixture sitting on my kitchen counter and use it everyday it to cleanse my counters, it is so convenient.  </li>
            <li> I put a few drops on my wool dryer balls and my laundry</li>
            <li> saw a few reviews mention not liking the smell.  </li>
            <li> It smells almost like lemons past their prime or maybe slightly rotten lemon -</li>
            <li> The only thing that is keeping me from 5 stars is that it does not come with a dropper and it is difficult to dispense.</li>
            <li> I have a small wart on one of my fingers, palm side.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lemon oil in the past but had run out.</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
            <li> I also spray down my wooden cutting boards.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> The smell and taste is not good.  </li>
            <li> Make a difference  in your laundry  if you have tough boys</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it like a perfume behind my ears and on my wrists because it helps with relaxation and stress relief</li>
            <li> He thought it would be weird.</li>
            <li> At the price and quality, you cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and thought this may be a cheaper substitute - wrong.</li>
            <li> I learned a few months ago the using dryer sheets is very bad for your health.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed though that the dropper was shattered when I received the product.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am very happy with this, I&#x27;ve been using it all over my house.  I primarily use it in cleaning products.  The smell is wonderful.  Unfortunately the cap doesn&#x27;t fit on mine but I think that was a fluke, because others don&#x27;t seem to have that problem. I would order again.</li>
            <li> My daughter gave me an infuser for Christmas and I absolutely love it. I wanted to venture out and try other essential oils. I ordered this Lemon Essential oil during a promotion. It is strongly scented but so are many essential oils when you get them. I have used it in my diffuser and it makes my house smell fresh and clean. There are so many benefits from essential oils. Lemon has many benefits externally and internally. I would not ingest this as I don&#x27;t know dosages and if it is medical grade. However, it can be used to gargle for sore throats, It is also an antiseptic and an antibacterial. I am happy with this oil. I am also excited about learning about essential oils and their benefits!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great product. Love having the bonus dropper, makes it easy to use. Nice clean fresh lemon scent. Great price and good quality essential oil. Very happy</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the oils that I purchased for my Christmas crafts. I was disappointed though that the dropper was shattered when I received the product.  )-:  The product came in a timely fashion as well!</li>
            <li> An excellent quality oil with no trace of extraction solvent. Shipping was prompt. The bottle and eye dropper top are sturdy and functional. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff! I primarily use it in my tea light oil burner, and whenever I open the door to my house it smells so lovely. I even had a cold yesterday and intentionally sat near and enhaled it and feel much better today. I wish they sold it in bulk!</li>
            <li> Love this pure lemon oil. I use it so many ways.</li>
            <li> This oil is very good. I use it to make my own air freshener mist &amp; in my aromatherapy diffuser. It&#x27;s uplifting &amp; smells clean &amp; fresh. I will definitely purchase this again &amp; recommend it.</li>
            <li> Best lemon oil around. A great value. Perfect for making lotion and sugar scrub.</li>
            <li> This is a quality oil. I&#x27;ve purchased a few other brands that undoubtedly had additives. This one is the best price for the size. I was also glad to see the origin was Italy. Thanks</li>
            <li> The oil has a wonderful clean scent. I use this oil to mask the scent of the Neem oil and tea tree oil I love to use because my husband hates the smell of both the aforementioned oils. Now he can&#x27;t tell when I&#x27;m using them anymore.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way because the lemon oil is very concentrated. I also use this in my car as an air freshener. I have also mixed this with peppermint oil and omgosh the two scents combined are awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could go on and on about the number uses but you get the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I run out I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Great value for a cold pressed oil.  Terrific scent and lemon oil has so many uses, great basic oil for a beginner.  The only thing that is keeping me from 5 stars is that it does not come with a dropper and it is difficult to dispense.</li>
            <li> I use lemon oil for almost everything - dish detergent, laundry detergent, floor cleaner, dusting spray - and this is the best price for this size bottle. Product was shipped immediately and I love having the dropper so I don&#x27;t worry about wasting my oil!</li>
            <li> A glass dropper filled with Lemon Essential Oil, a drop of dish washing soap - to prevent stains - and a cup of water, all mixed together and sprayed, made our whole house smell of fresh lemons for days. I have heard that beside smelling great, the same procedure is a  very good spider repellant.</li>
            <li> Amazing oil!  With prime shipping it arrived right on time!</li>
            <li> Nice quality oil in a dark jar with dropper.  Great scent and packaging.</li>
            <li> I decided to try making my own cleaning products and am glad that I purchased this essential oil. I am so pleased with the smell and have been pleased with how well it helps me clean. I&#x27;ve used it on my floors and counters with no streaks! I have also used a little bit with my laundry to give it a fresh clean smell! I was so happy to receive this as part of a promotional offer! I was really surprised with how large the bottle is. It will last for quite a while!! My husband has commented on how lovely the house smells after using the lemon essential oil!</li>
            <li> My family and I have recently starting using Essential Oils in place of cleaners/air fresheners that have chemicals in them.  When I saw a promotion for this Lemon Essential Oil I was excited to give it a try.  This is the best smelling Lemon Oil that I have purchased.  The size of the bottle (4oz) is fantastic for the price!  The dropper that comes with it fits perfectly on top of the bottle and does not leak.  It is very easy to control the amount of drops that I use as well.  I personally put a few drops into baking soda and sprinkle it onto the carpet overnight for fresh smelling carpets!  I also use diffusers in the bedrooms and living rooms and this oil smells amazing while being diffused!</li>
            <li> Very pleased...bought it twice</li>
            <li> Love this oil! It is bright and energizing. I mix it with my Teddie Organics Rosehip oil in the morning and apply to my face to wake me up and it works like a charm everytime! The smell may not be strong enough for others but because I apply it to my face and body it is just the right amount of citrus without being overbearing!</li>
            <li> Great value. I like the quality, purity, and included dropper. The vendor is also very helpful and nice. (They must be using their own lemon oil)</li>
            <li> What a great sent this oil gives! I love to use my oil in homemade cleaners. It&#x27;s has a nice fresh, tart yet sweet smell. It leaves my house smelling amazing! I also like to add this lemon essential oil to homemade lotion. It&#x27;s leaves a beautiful scent lingering on my skin. The lemon essential oil comes with a eyedropper that screws tightly onto the bottle.  This eyedropper is extremely helpful in portioning out the correct amount of drops. This is a great bargain and I love that I was able to get this on promotion. I use this oil daily, I love it!</li>
            <li> I had never used lemon oil for cleaning but wanted a great smelling cleaner that works. I finally found it!  This lemon oil came up as a promotion and I was really excited. After using this to clean and refresh the house I would highly recommend it. I will definitely be purchasing again</li>
            <li> its not real. a lot of alcohol content. compare to doterra, this lemon scent is gone in 10 min. while do terra one last all day. so different! have to return.</li>
            <li> This lemon essential oil is the first essential oil I have ever used. I&#x27;ve heard wonderful things about oils, so when I was able to purchase this product during a promotional period, I jumped at the chance! The smell is very bright and uplifting, and the dropper ensures that you are getting just the right amount for whatever your needs are. I have used this lemon oil diluted in water for cleaning around my kitchen, and it works well - the smell is a real bonus! I would highly recommend this oil to anyone who is interested in giving essential oils a try!</li>
            <li> I love these essential oils.  I will order them again.  They are great with great price &amp; arrived in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> I use lemon oil alot so this size is great for me.</li>
            <li> I use this product along with other oils to make poopoo spray that I spray in the toilet before i do my stinky business. Since I use it, I odn&#x27;t EVER need air spray. This is a good scent to use in the potty.</li>
            <li> label was not applied smoothly - when it comes to my essential oils that is something I watch for very carefully. I do diffuse it but have NOT ingested it as it does not say it is recommended to use it that way. The regular brand of Lemon Essential oil it is indigestible - I was looking to find an alternate, less expensive option since I put it in my water often to aide in digestion.</li>
            <li> This oil smells absolutely amazing!! I bought this to use for making lemon scented candles (they smelled fantastic!) but I also found a lot of other uses for it as well (Google uses for lemon oil, I swear it&#x27;s good for everything). I&#x27;ll definitely be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I just received my order of Lemon Essential Oil and I LOVE IT!  It is by far a superior product compared to others I&#x27;ve used in the past (not to mention that the price was great).  It&#x27;s so much easier than squeezing lemons in the morning for my warm lemon drink.  This is the one I&#x27;ll be ordering from here on out.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Nice product!  My wife is making soaps for gifts this year, and this product has been very good for her citrus-based soaps.  The dropper (included) helps in better measuring the amount you&#x27;re using (to improve reproducibility in her recipes).</li>
            <li> Great for adding to laundry detergent.</li>
            <li> I started using Essential Oils several months ago when I had bronchitis. I&#x27;ve purchased a few different varieties, but really consider myself a newbie to the whole world of EOs. This lemon oil was recently offered at a reduced price through a promotion, so since I hadn&#x27;t tried lemon EO before, I was excited to order it. As with many of the other reviews, I was quite surprised with the size of the bottle. It is much larger than my other essential oil bottles. All of my other oils are in tiny ml bottles. It has a nice, crisp lemon scent which is very pleasing. Once I had it, I started looking around on the internet for good uses of lemon oil. I found that lemon essential oil could be used to remove warts. I have a small wart on one of my fingers, palm side.  I applied a drop of lemon oil to the wart &amp; after just one day, it shrunk to about half its size. I&#x27;ve been applying the oil 2 -3 times per day &amp; covering it with a band aid. A few more days have passed, and the changes haven&#x27;t been as dramatic as the first day, but it&#x27;s still shrinking in size. It doesn&#x27;t burn or sting and there have been no side effects to the area of skin around the wart. I find that I raise my hand to smell the lemon scent a lot. I also started using it as a room fragrance. I applied some oil to a cotton ball &amp; placed it on a shelf in my bathroom. I only put a few drops on it. I am looking forward to trying out some home made cleaning products.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells pretty good and comes in a very generous size. Been using it to perfume up the house for a nice lemony smell. I like how it comes with a regular cap and a separate dripper cap. That&#x27;s helpful if you need to really seal it up if you&#x27;re traveling or something. Very pleased to have received this during a promotion. Essential oils are awesome, especially this lemon on! mmm mmm!</li>
            <li> I have used essential oils for a number of years and am absolutely sold on them.  I was lucky to get this very BIG bottle at a promotional price.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s about twice as big as the ones I usually buy, so I was really excited when I received it.  This 100% pure oil has a clean, fresh scent that I diffuse with bergamot oil for energy and concentration.  As a bonus, it makes my living room smell great.  I&#x27;ve also used it like a perfume behind my ears and on my wrists because it helps with relaxation and stress relief (I recently bought a new laptop after frying my old one and I was desperate for stress relief after spending hours trying get everything back where it belonged).  I also swipe a little pure lemon oil on cuts to prevent infection, and I&#x27;ve used it to remove the gummy residue from labels and to remove oil stains from my laundry.  I LOVE coffee with a drop or two in a cup, and I regularly mix it with water for use as a gargle with to freshen my breath.  You can use this lemon oil for so many things it&#x27;s impossible to list them here.  These are just the ones I&#x27;ve used it for in the last few weeks.  I would definitely recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> I am really big into using essential oils around my home for making all-natural beauty and home products and anything citrus is my all time favorite, especially lemon because it is incredibly versatile.  Our homes, with our array of cleaning products, shampoos, detergents, etc.,  have become a haven of toxicity.  That is why I started getting into making my own natural products  ---  cheaper, and healthier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this Better Shea Butter 100% Essential Lemon oil for many reasons.  It is exactly what it says it is-  PURE Lemon Essential Oil.  I have used a lot of lemon oil, and many different brands, and this one, in my opinion, is right up there in quality and  kind of moves ahead of the pack due to it&#x27;s very generous size and price.  If you use it like I do, a large quantity is very much appreciated.  It has sooooo many uses that having a bottle in my home at all times is a MUST.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I have been using my big bottle of BSB Lemon Essential Oil for?  My number one use is making my own homemade body butter.  I made a batch with this oil along with a few drops of lavender, and my friends love it!  Makes an excellent household cleaner.  I mix a few drops in a couple cups of filtered water in a spray bottle along with a splash of vinegar.  Helps keep ants away too.  They hate citrus!  I also make my own carpet refresher with a few drops mixed with borax and baking soda.  I love adding a few drops in my bath.  I could go on and on about what I use it for,  just about everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, even though the bottle says &amp;#34;external use&amp;#34; only, I have been using 1 drop, just ONE drop in a glass of water.  It helps to flush toxins out of the body and supports the liver and kidneys.  100% Lemon Oil is STRONG and if ingested, needs to be used very sparingly.  I did some research and am convinced Lemon oil is safe to be ingested if used sparingly and properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brown bottle is nice, protects it from light, the label is pretty enough to keep the bottle displayed in your kitchen or bathroom.  The long glass stopper is really handy.  All in all, I am very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I was thrilled to have purchased this item with a coupon I received for my honest, unbiased review. I count on good, honest reviews for my online shopping so my reviews are nothing but my 100% honest opinion!  Even though my first bottle was discounted, I will most definitely be buying this product again.

            <li> I had the opportunity to purchase this oil as a promotional product for an honest opinion. I had recently ran out of my lemon essential oil so I jumped at this chance. This pure lemon essential oil can be used by adding a few drops in a glass of water to boost your immune system and fight off colds. The product description said when I ordered it that you could injest it but the label on the bottle says for external use. I have used lemon essential oils before and the label on those said the same. You can also put a few drops on a capsule and swallow it to boost your immune system as well. I drop a few drops in my garbarage disposal for a fresh clean smell as well. I have used it mixed with some water in a diffuser to freshen up a room. I have used it in homemade cleaning products that calls for lemon juice. This lemon essential oil is high quality, and the free glass dropper is such a helpful addition to help control how much oil you utilize.</li>
            <li> COLD-pressed FROM RINDS OF REAL LEMONS!!!!!  What more could you ask for?  Getting a great quality product here with authentic lemon oil is fabulous!!  The bottle is very large for the price and it has a very fresh clean smell to it.  I have been using it in a sprayer for my counters and with my home-made disinfectant and I love the aroma.  It not only lifts me up but it also has great healing properties.  I received this through a promotion and I am so glad I did.  This company has taken the time and energy to have a great product that sells for a great price.  It also comes with a convenient dropper for distinct measurements.  Thanks for making a great product!</li>
            <li> It smells like a real lemon, I love it!! I&#x27;m very sensitive for any kind of smell but this oil is very natural with no chemicals added. Great  customer service with fast shipping. I  ordered ivory Shea butter &amp; rosehip oil  from them earlier &amp;  looking forward for new products for my DIY projects from this company.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Good price.  I&#x27;d say 5 stars because what&#x27;s not yo like about good lemon oil?</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing lemon essential oil and I am so happy with this product. I use oils to scent my homemade cleaning supplies and to mask the smell of an herbal hair treatment I use. I have a variety of different oils and was totally excited to try lemon oil when my mom hooked me up with a promo code. This bottle is waaaay bigger than any of the oils I have purchased locally so that was an awesome surprise. It smells amazing, the dropper and lid work perfectly and I have not a single complaint! I made carpet freshener and my house smells delicious!</li>
            <li> The lemon essential oil is a terrific all around oil. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. I&#x27;ve always used lemon oil to polish my wood furniture.With this essential oil I add a few drops to water in a spray bottle and use it as a cleaner for my furniture.  I also mix some with a carrier oil and use as a room freshener and &amp;#34;dog&amp;#34; freshener. Yes, I spritz my dogs with it! All in all, I was glad to purchase this with a promotional coupon and now have a fresh smelling house. I do have to add that the fresh lemon scent not only brightens my house, but my mood as well.</li>
            <li> Exactly what it says. Pure lemon oil. My significant other uses it on the necks of his guitars and it works great!</li>
            <li> This smells odd and doesn&#x27;t smell like lemon oil at all.....I will keep it since I am just using it to clean but will not reorder.</li>
            <li> Fantastic universal product.</li>
            <li> Love all of the products from Better Shea Butter, the recipes are great too! Keep &#x27;em coming</li>
            <li> Wonderful!  Should last a long time.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff! It came with a regular top and the dropper, and it&#x27;s a big bottle for the price. The smell is heavenly and I put a few drops in my coconut or almond oil before moisturizing. Will definitely order again (soon!). This is everything I expect from a high quality, pure essential oil.</li>
            <li> awesome! I love that they followed up with an email suggesting some uses.  I put mine to good use right away!</li>
            <li> Personal deodorant for guys</li>
            <li> This lemon oil met my expectations,its bright clean scent is what I was looking for,some oils don&#x27;t have the scent I like,kind of murky.  I will use this lemon oil for my soap,give it a lovely smell for summer.</li>
            <li> We use essential oils as our first aid kit, cleaning supplies, etc.  Lemon is a standard and a must-have.  It is one that we HATE running out of so I was happy to buy this large bottle during a promotional period!  This lemon EO seems to be very high quality and I LOVE that it has a dropper top included that screws on.  Lemon is the main oil in all of our cleaning sprays, it works so well and everything has a fresh scent.  I also love this oil in a face mask and as a general pick-me-up in the morning or throughout the day.  The scent is strong or harsh (as some reviews mentioned) if you sniff the bottle directly but once it is diluted in smaller quantities, it is a light fresh scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was quick and it was packaged securely.</li>
            <li> So far... I have used this lemon oil as a very effective bathroom deoderizer, just a few drops in the toilet; works great.. Also good when used to freshen musty closet odors. I am glad I found the product and am sure I will find more ways to use this natural fragrance.</li>
            <li> Not as strong lemon oil as I am used to, but price is much less.  It is not a bad trade-off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a lot of EO over the past few months and most were great, some just so so. Lemon Essential oil is a staple in my home and this 4oz jar won&#x27;t last long. The reason I&#x27;m writing this review is because the lovely folks at better Shea Butter followed up on my purchase and offered uses for Lemon EO. I like that.&lt;br /&gt;I like this product because is smells like lemons, to me, it tastes like lemons and I prefer the simple packaging. So I give it 5 stars, the packaging was good, although the box could have been a bit larger to accommodate for the glass dropper, but, I&#x27;ll give them a pass on that because it INCLDUED A GLASS DROPPER! Good value for the size.[[ASIN:B00OY6OGO2 Lemon Essential Oil by Better Shea Butter - 4 fl oz in Amber Glass Bottle with Dropper]]</li>
            <li> It is not exactly what I thought it was, but it has a great aroma.</li>
            <li> Authentic lemon smell.I like it</li>
            <li> I purchased this essential oil to make a sugar scrub.  It is perfect!  It added a light lemon fragrance without being too sweet or overpowering.</li>
            <li> Used this for cooking - so much better than using olive oil with lemon oil and worth the price difference b/c I use so much less.</li>
            <li> This is the second oil I have purchased from this supplier and I am very happy. The bottle was packaged very nicely and securely in the box. I have been using essential oils for a couple of years now, and this lemon oil has by far the best aroma. I was able to purchase this lemon oil as part of a promotion, but the advertised price is extremely fair compared to other oils, and this will be the only lemon I buy from now on. I like to put a few drops into baking soda and use it as a deodorizer for my carpets and area rugs, makes my whole house smell wonderful! It&#x27;s also a great companion oil in my diffuser. Very pleased with this oil and the sellers, as usual, have great communication!!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love my lemon essential oil! I make playdough for my son&#x27;s preschool and I have been adding this to the yellow dough so it smells like sunshine. The kids LOVE it!! I love the dropper that comes with it, making adding the oil super easy. Occasionally I will add this to my bath when I do other scents to help tone them down just a bit. It also goes great in vinegar that I use for wiping down my counters and floors. The lemon makes everything smell so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Had no idea how big this bottle would be. I was expecting a tiny (typical) bottle but you read it right - it really is four ounces! Smells heavenly...</li>
            <li> Had to reorder, and will always come back here for more when I need. I use this for everything. Sensational.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful oil!  I use it to make my own cleaning supplies and my house smells lemony clean!</li>
            <li> Love this oil...made a slat scrub with some citrus zest and it came out so perfect. Came quick too! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I really love this oil.  It was well packaged and comes with a dropper.  I&#x27;ve used it in all sorts of homemade cleaners and face and body scrubs.  it smells of lemon awsomness!</li>
            <li> This oil exceeded my expectations I use it to deter my cat from wanting to urinate on the carpet I was told by other cat owners cat to not like lemon  and it works. I am going to try it out side I have some stray cats sleeping under some plants and are breaking them. The smell of the lemon oil is refreshing and calming.</li>
            <li> Oh the uses for Lemon EO.  I put it in my outside fountains and no more mosquitos.  A couple of drops on my wool dryer balls and the clothes come out lemon fresh with no static or harsh chemicals that actually make your clothes more flammable.</li>
            <li> I love lemon! I got this oil to use in a homemade deodorant, and it smells divine. I put it in everything I can. Seems to be of high quality, no artificial or chemical smells. I use it in a diffuser, put it in my homemade cleaning products, put a couple drops into my laundry soap dispenser, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS-&lt;br /&gt;High quality&lt;br /&gt;clean fresh scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS-&lt;br /&gt;None that I can tell! Other than citrus oil can cause photo-sensitivity, so do not apply to skin before sun exposure</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected. Packaged very well for shipping.</li>
            <li> I use this essential oil in a fairly broad series of things. I shaker a few drops into my bath at night to help me relax and I squeeze a few drops into my shampoo to help my clean hair shine without stripping it out.</li>
            <li> I am new to essential oils, and find this very pleasant.  Using it in a diffuser makes for a relaxing mood.</li>
            <li> Just as described.... Wonderful products.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, love using it to clean around the house, keep bugs away and clean my wood. Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> This lemon essential oil is high quality, and the free included dropper is such a helpful addition.  I have used it in homemade cleaning products - a general cleaning spray and a toilet bowl cleaner, and it&#x27;s worked well and adds a nice, natural, non-chemical scent.  I will be using in many more DIY gift  projects before the holidays.  It comes very quickly after ordering and is packaged well.  Really like this company!</li>
            <li> The oil has a slight patchouli scent. It is ok, but I do not plan to purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping..fantastic product with a so many uses! I have been using it combined with baking soda to &amp;#34;de-dog&amp;#34; the carpeting in our home. Works wonderfully and no nasty chemicals. Just pour a layer of baking soda in a container that has a lid, use a few drops of the lemon oil, pour another layer of baking soda and repeat until you have the amount you want then shake an sprinkle on carpet...let sit a few minutes and vacuum.</li>
            <li> WHen I ordered this lemon oil I really did not realize how big a 4ox bottle really is!! I am used to my small essential oil bottles! I have been using a few drop to clean my kitchen and I have also been using it in my defuser to make my house smell fresh and springy!! I an in love this this oil!! I am so lucky I was chosen to test the product at a discounted price!!</li>
            <li> First of all, this smells amazing! The scent of lemon is so refreshing just by itself, but I love that it also has disinfecting and healing properties. I&#x27;ve used this to add to vinegar and water as a cleaner, and I&#x27;ve used it to make sugar scrub. It has done a great job with both of those applications as the smell has stayed consistent and unchanged which means it&#x27;s good quality. The bottle is a good size so you can get a lot of use from it. I also really like that it came with a dropper that can screw on like a lid. This makes it so convenient to use and gives you the option of which kind of lid you&#x27;d like to use. I also really like the design of the label. It&#x27;s clear and easy to read, but still cute to look at. I received a discount in exchange for my honest review. I truly love this lemon essential oil and can&#x27;t imagine my household without it now that I&#x27;ve tried it.</li>
            <li> I learned a few months ago the using dryer sheets is very bad for your health. I switched to wool dryer balls instead. They are working amazingly, but I miss the added scent since we use unscented laundry detergent. I received a promotional code to get this essential oil for a discount so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. My husband was a little leery at first about having our clothes smell like lemon. He thought it would be weird. We&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks, which in this house means about 10 loads of laundry. We just add 1 drop to each of the 3 wool dryer balls after the clothes are dry. Then we put it on the lowest heat setting for an additional 10 minutes. Our clothes smell GREAT! It works so well and both my husband and I enjoy the scent. Even though that&#x27;s the main reason I wanted this, I love that there are additional uses because it&#x27;s lemon and not a flower scent. I have begun adding it to water in a spray bottle for a disinfectant to clean the kitchen. We have young kids so I feel much better using this than a chemical. It&#x27;s safe, works wonderfully, and smells clean and fresh.  Disclosure: I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I have not been compensated in any way, nor promised any future promotions. I have no affiliation with the company at all, and I am not required to leave a positive review. All thoughts are my own and have not been influenced.</li>
            <li> This lemon oil smells like cleanliness bliss. I love adding this oil to my favorite homemade cleaners and body scrubs. I usually make homemade wet mop refills for my Rubbermaid wet mop and I added just a few drops of lemon oil to my last batch and I was so happy to have the buight, cheery lemon scent as an addition. Usually I would make my solution with vinegar, a dash of dawn, and hot water and it wouldn&#x27;t smell as fragrant as I&#x27;d liked when I was using lemon cleaning solution commercial product, but this takes the place and meets the needs to adding scents that are all natural to my batches.</li>
            <li> I usually buy Now Foods brand essential oils, but was running short on money and decided to go cheap. This oil isn&#x27;t quite as strong as Now Foods, but it is pretty good considering how much money I saved!  I used it for making Thieves Oil, and I use a lot of it. This 4 oz bottle should last me a month or so. I am happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> This oil smells AHHHHmazing! I absolutely love it! I was delivered super fast and packaged to where it arrived in one piece which is always a plus. Also, I really like the fact that it came with a dropper that attaches as a lid so I don&#x27;t have another separate piece laying around waiting to get lost. I intend to start using it by putting a drop in my washing loads when doing towels and sheets. Also, I plan to dilute some in a spray bottle to spray around stinky bathrooms and litter boxes. I can&#x27;t wait to smell fresh lemon all around my home! I ordered it as part of a promotion and boy am I glad I did! A++</li>
            <li> Smells nice pack in a nice box also comes with a dropper, I got this to freshen up the rooms. Fast delivery on time.</li>
            <li> Best lemon oil I have found to date! Great product.</li>
            <li> I make most of my household cleaners and this was just what I needed! The smell is amazing; pure lemon all the way. I use it in my cleaning spray and in my laundry soap. The size is larger than I expected and it will last me for long time! I&#x27;m looking for more uses to add to the list. If you need a good lemon oil this is totally the way to go. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of lemon essential oil. It is so invigorating and the many uses for it are amazing! The Lemon Oil came sealed with a separate glass dropper that also screwed onto the bottle so you don’t lose it. I used the lemon essential oil for so many different things. Just smelling it can cheer you up! Lemon is a great smell to have anytime, filling your home with that citrus scent. You can use it in a homemade cleaner, leaving your kitchen counters smelling delicious; or polish up the wooden furniture, letting the aroma fill your living room. If you add it to your cold water or warm tea, it will help boost your metabolism and your mood. Smelling the aroma of the lemon, is refreshing, energizing, and mind clearing. I saw this was offered for a promotion and I jumped at the opportunity!</li>
            <li> I use this on my fact and neck at least twice daily. It refreshes and renews my skin and gets rid of spots (as in age spots) - and FAST! Love this product. Please keep it in stock because I&#x27;ll be ordering more soon!!!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, great smelling large bottle of lemon EO. Perfect for how much we use around the house, especially freshening the washing machine and garbage disposal! Would order again.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I add just a couple drops to my vinegar &amp; water cleaner and smells great.  I also put some in my candle warmer.  Such a clean lemon sent.  Will defiantly be purchasing this again from the seller (peppermint is equally amazing).</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a perfume that smells like lemon for ages. Everything I have tried smells like cleaner and not a fresh squeezed lemon. I ordered this product hoping I would get lucky and I did .I&#x27;m very pleased with quality of this essential oil! I was also positively surprise with the glass dropper, big plus for me since I stay away from plastics.&lt;br /&gt;I use this essential oil in everything, in my home made perfume, scrubs, home cleaners, laundry soap and home air freshener.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to a friend to use.</li>
            <li> Lemon Essential Oil ~ Lovely!  Smells so fresh!  I purchased for my Atomizer, using a coupon, Our house smells so fresh and clean!!  We also use for headaches, a touch at the temples and the forehead. This is the second essential oil that we have purchased from this manufacturer, we definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Bought this product as part of a promotion. First of all this essential oil smells amazing. Lemon is my favorite scent. It is so freash and clean smelling. I like to add it home made cleaners. When I make a home made cleaner, I often miss the fesh smell that comes along with store bought ckeaers. Now I can add a few drops of this essential oil.  Reminds me of spring. Second, this bottle is huge. It is great value for money and will last forever. I put some down the garbage disposal today after doing dishes and my kitchen smelled like I just cleaned it. The droper fits snug on the bottle and it easy to control. I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Excellent service. Good product. Thanks !</li>
            <li> This is my most favorite lemon oil, good quality. it smells so natural fresh and so clean.I use in my diffuser to eliminate strong food odor in my kitchen . it is most effective of cleaning the air. Thank you Better shea butter Company for good product. Very Satisfied</li>
            <li> Delivered fast and lemony fresh!! I made lemon bath scrub for Christmas and it smells delicious!! Thank you guys!!!  I will definitely order from you again!!</li>
            <li> Since I started  using lemon oil around my home especially in my laundry. Wow! IT. Just makes my clothes smell. So lemony and refreshed  I,d recommend  this to any one  it. Really does. Make a difference  in your laundry  if you have tough boys it eliminates the odors and gives the clothes a fresh  smell  so invigorating  I just wish I,d tried this years ago. Thanks , Amazon.com</li>
            <li> I had never tried using essential oils before, Im glad I chose this product. The scent is natural but potent enough to be effective. I love it in my laundry.</li>
            <li> This lemon oil is EXCELENT. Shipping first, it was well packed and snug in the box, showing up on time. Couldn&#x27;t have asked for more in that department. Oil quality is amazing. I use it for a lot of things, including fragrance for rooms and myself, as well as my dogs (a tiny drop at the base of their neck on the fur, not the skin, keeps them smelling sooo fresh and does not irritate their skin). The free dropper came in handy, and unlike some other &amp;#34;free droppers&amp;#34; I have received, this one actually fits the bottle and can be screwed on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think that this company really deserves a 5 star rating. The vendor followed up with me upon delivery and was really nice and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> it is and smells natural! I&#x27;m using it to mix it with water and mop the tile floor in my bathroom. It really leaves a very pleasant scent for at least a couple of days. I&#x27;m  looking at using it in other areas. I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> smells more like a citronella candle</li>
            <li> Really high quality lemon oil. I use it to add a fresh scent to my laundry, but I&#x27;m also thinking about using it to make homemade cleaning products. Really like this company - got some awesome shea butter from them too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll love this.  It has a dropper as well!  I have the orange oil and my refrig smells super great.  It does not have a dropper.  By the way, 30 drops equals half teaspoon.  When researching, you&#x27;ll see measurements in mL.  Huh?  So, hope I saved you time.</li>
            <li> I purchased the lemon oil as a natural flea deterrent for my pets and am quite pleased with the effects. I have not found any fleas on my pets and they smell so good.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful. I would prefer a reducer cap to a dropper, but it works just fine.</li>
            <li> Yucky non-sweet lemon oil smell. Not so special like the one I get down the street at the health food store.</li>
            <li> Excellent; will continue to purchase this Time and time again</li>
            <li> Great quality, great price. Been incorporating essential oils into my routine lately and I love it. So easy to add a few drops to water and salads instead of dealing with produce. I an always on the go and keeping fresh healthy options around is a goal of mine. Also use in the diffuser to make the house smell lemony fresh :)</li>
            <li> Smells super fresh and the 4 oz site will last a very long time.  Great quality for the price</li>
            <li> Love this product. I use it to make my household cleaners and air fresheners.</li>
            <li> Use as a cleaning product due to it&#x27;s antibacterial properties.</li>
            <li> looks great, haven&#x27;t tried yet.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful. I use it to repel brown recluse&#x27;s in my home. I sprinkle it on my carpet. It works.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, fresh Lemon scent! Works well with all my body butters, bath oils, deodorant creams, etc. Love the glass dropper!</li>
            <li> Wonderful fresh smell. I bought this promo deal to make homemade cleaning products. Worked great. In some lesser quality oils I&#x27;ve used in the past the oil has left a greasy smudge. I did not have that problem with this one. I did read on the label that it was for external use only which is fine with me since my main reason was for cleaning supplies. It was an added bonus that the bottle included a nice dropper top as well.</li>
            <li> This product is great!  I love the scent of anything citrus - it just makes me instantly happy and feel clean!  I&#x27;m going to put a few drops in a water bottle and use it as a linen spray - think of it as a natural deodorizer!  I&#x27;m also going to use with my cleaning products.  This bottle was purchased with a promotional code and will last me a long time. Website had good ideas and tips foe use also.Thank you!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. I utilize oils in my everyday. I am enjoying this oil for cleaning purposes. I was able to review this product for a promotion event. Super excited. I use it in conjunction with olive oil to polish my wood surfaces. The smell is very fresh. This will last me for a very long time. I also plan to make a mixture of vinegar and this oil to clean other surfaces. I was so excited when I received a coupon to order this oil. This product is very useful and handy.</li>
            <li> I add this to my tea and water daily. It&#x27;s also my perfume when I&#x27;m feeling vivacious.</li>
            <li> I am really excited to be using this oil in homemade cleaning products for my house! It&#x27;s great to be able to have a fresh, clean smell without worrying about harsh chemicals! Also, I am thankful that the label says not to ingest it!! I would have added it to my water without thinking about it! I received a promotional discount on this product, but all opinions are my own!</li>
            <li> The smell and taste is not good.  Not that bright, uplifting lemony smell I was expecting (like you get with NOW or doTerra essential lemon oil).  My husband gagged after tasting a glass of water with a few drops in it.  There was no way I was contaminating my aromatherapy diffuser with it.  It is almost like it was made from old peels-definitely not what I expected form &amp;#34;cold pressed.&amp;#34;  Maybe lemons smell differently in Italy.  The only saving grace was that it brightened enough when paired with peppermint oil (I use both in my liquid hand soaps), which was my main purpose for purchasing it.</li>
            <li> Smells great! I use it to make household cleaning products</li>
            <li> Good tart lemony scent. Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Love the smell..and comes with a dropper...I mix with vinegar, water and a little hydrogen peroxide to clean my countertops and appliance fronts</li>
            <li> This lemon oil has a weird unpleasant smell, kind of like old rotting lemons. I am returning it.</li>
            <li> We removed all manufactured cleaning products from our home over 2 years ago.  We have been using essential oils for cleaning since then, so I was so excited to be asked to try this lemon essential oil through a promotion and give my opinion.  First of all let me say I am quite happy with this particular oil.  Lemon essential oil is antibacterial, antibiotic, antiseptic, antiviral, and astringent...in other words it is the perfect cleaner.  When this oil arrived I went right to the kitchen and mixed /2 cup water, 1/2 cup white vinegar, and 15 drops in a spray bottle and started to clean.  I use this use mixture as a general cleaner, the house smells wonderful after I am done cleaning.  I keep a bottle of this mixture sitting on my kitchen counter and use it everyday it to cleanse my counters, it is so convenient.  I just spray, wait for 3 minutes and wipe.  I also spray down my wooden cutting boards.  A real plus is that lemon essential oil is a known pick-you-up as you breathe it in and this particular lemon essential oil certainly does this.  Every home needs this oil.</li>
            <li> During the past year, I have discovered the wonderful benefits of essential oils. I started using some oils as replacements for OTC medication. For example, instead of taking medicine for a headache, I simply apply peppermint on my temples to alleviate some of the pressure. This has come especially handy during springtime. So, when I came across the Lemon Essential Oil through a promotion, I knew I had to have this product. The lemon essential oil comes with a dropper that allows you to not over pour the oil into or onto whatever you decide. So far, I have used this oil in my diffuser which I keep in my kitchen. Instead of spraying harsh spray, I simply put the lemon in the diffuser and very quickly the room is smelling like I just wiped everything down with a lemon spray. Another great component of this product is the fact that it is 4oz. Most essential oils come in much smaller portions. The lemon smell is strong and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of essential oils, and lemon is one of my favorites.  I generally buy DoTerra brand essential oils, but I bought this one during a promotion to see how it stands up, because let&#x27;s face it, DoTerra is expensive.  All the opinions in this review are my own.  First, it is a very large bottle (compared to my Doterra essential oils), and the price is definitely right.  I use oils for diffusing and for cleaning.  I love using a homemade disinfectant with vodka, lavender and lemon essential oils, and distilled water.  This bottle of oil is perfect for my mixture.  It has a nice lemon scent, though it is more antiseptic smelling than my DoTerra, which I like, especially for cleaning. Although it is nice to diffuse, I do prefer the scent of DoTerra better.  This is also really, really great for getting gunk and stink off your hands.  I love to cook, but I hate the residual smell of garlic and onion on my hands.  A small drop of this and then wash, the smell is completely gone (just be careful with using lemon oil and exposure to the sun...too much can lead to damage - but I use it at night after cooking dinner, so I get my 12 hours without sun after use).  I really, really like the medicine dropper for the bottle.  All my other brands of essential oils have a top that is supposed to just let out a droplet of oil at a time; however, I end up wasting a bunch because once I get my 2-3 drops, another 2-3 come out before I can turn the bottle right side up.  But not with this oil.  I have so much control with the medicine dropper, and it screws right on top of the bottle for easy storage.  Overall, this I an essential oil that I will definitely add to my collection.  At the price and quality, you cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li> Yummm I love this lemon oil. I was definitely not expecting this big of a bottle when I ordered this item through a promotion.  It is a very large bottle and a great price.  I have used it to diffuse and it smells wonderful.  I will be using it to clean with and in my laundry to add some freshness. Because the price is so good I will not feel guilty at all about using it in every batch of laundry I do.  I am so excited to have found this oil what a great product.  I would highly recommend this !!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love all natural products.  I was delighted to get this with a coupon.  When it arrived I was surprised at how big the bottle was!  Much larger than I expected.  This is the best smelling lemon essential oil I have ever smelled!  It&#x27;s wonderful!  So fresh &amp; clean.  I love to use it on my dryer balls for drying my clothes &amp; to make sugar scrub.  An amazing product for sure!  If you love lemon &amp; want an essential oil this is the product for you!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to buy a variety of essential oils to have on hand so when a need comes up.  Lemon oil was high on the list.  I was offered the opportunity to purchase this brand at a discount in exchange for an honest opinion, all opinions are my own!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already have a natural cleaning product I love so wasn&#x27;t looking for a disinfectant, but sometimes you miss that smell- you know, usually made up of chemicals, but our brains tell us it is clean!  What I first used this for was to help my brain overcome the fact that clean doesn&#x27;t have a smell.  I put a few drops into a spray bottle with water and sprayed it lightly around my house and it gave that light lemon smell!  No chemical laden candles or air fresheners necessary!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next I heard it is perfect for putting into the laundry when you leave the laundry in the wash for too long.  I put a few drops on my wool dryer balls and my laundry now also has that light lemon fresh scent.  Nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw a few reviews mention not liking the smell.  I found that straight in the bottle it is a little strong, not unpleasant, but strong.  When diluted or only using a few drops at a time, the scent is perfectly lemony fresh!</li>
            <li> We use essential oils for a lot of things around the house, so when I had a chance to order this during a promotional period, I couldn&#x27;t wait to receive it. I&#x27;ve used lemon oil in the past but had run out. First of all, four ounces is a *big* bottle! I am used to those itty bitty little bottles most oils came in, so that was a happy surprise. It came with a glass dropper, which I really appreciate since a little goes a very long way, and pouring can lead to disaster. I used the oil to make lemon butter cream and it turned out amazing, and I&#x27;ve also used it in a vinegar solution for cleaning as well as adding a couple of drops to a cotton ball to keep in dresser drawers. It has such a bright taste and a fresh, clean smell, the possibilities for use are just about endless.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. I just brought 3 bottles so far. The Lemon smell is great for my soaps. I Will buy more. I am 27 year old African American. The ladies love the smell on me. Will buy more.</li>
            <li> First of all, this smells DELICIOUS.  It&#x27;s also a very generously sized bottle.  So far I&#x27;ve used it mainly to add to my homemade cleaning solutions but I&#x27;ve also diffused it in my kitchen and loved the scent.  If you love lemon and essential oils, you&#x27;ll love this.  It&#x27;s a good quality dark glass bottle, the dropper works efficiently, and the oil itself seems a high grade.  I was able to order this during a promotional period, but I won&#x27;t hesitate to reorder when I run out.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing smell, Love it. I was surprised to get such a big bottle of Lemon oil with the promotion price. The dropper that comes with it fits perfectly and does not leak. It is very easy to control the amount when using the dropper. I’ve used it in my diffusers to make the house smell refreshing and clean without a heavy smell.  I’m also using on a rag to put in the dry as a dryer sheet, just a few drops does it. I’m excited to use as a cleaning product to mix up my own and go to town cleaning.  Did I say I love the great fresh smell.</li>
            <li> Love the scent this oil adds to my homemade cleaning products.  It really freshens up my kitchen.  It is comparable to lemon essential oils I&#x27;ve used before and the price is great.  I did receive this at a promotion cost to test out and review and I think it works wonderfully and is a great product.</li>
            <li> Essential oils are simply amazing. I use them in my favorite natural beauty recipes and some natural cleaning recipes too. As I&#x27;m trying to continuously add new oils to what I already have, when I was lucky enough to get a coupon during a promotion I jumped at the chance to buy this oil. This is definitely a high quality essential oil. Nice amber bottle, good aroma and working eye dropper which are all important when selecting a good essential oil. I&#x27;ve used this in my laundry, my shampoo, made my own mask and even add a couple drops to water to help with metabolism. I love this lemon oil! It smells so good! If you&#x27;re looking to start using essential oils in your daily routine I highly advise getting this today!</li>
            <li> This cold pressed pure lemon essential oil has a clean, uplifting scent and very convenient glass dropper. I gave it four stars for what it is but would subtract one for the Amazon Product Description because the package label clearly says it is only for external use, which was a disappointment after having ordered it in large part because of the Product Description statement that &amp;#34;A few drops in a glass of water boosts your energy level, keeps you healthy, and tastes great.&amp;#34; The confusion seems to come from the source, though, as their own webpage description also suggests drinking a few drops in a glass of water to boost your immune system and fight off colds. I must say, too, that NOW lemon smells like you&#x27;ve just squeezed a lemon peel, whereas this product is more like a lemon that&#x27;s been in the fridge a while, or maybe lemonade. It&#x27;s a good price, though, and the dropper is easy to control.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.bettersheabutter.com/must-have-essential-oils-part-i-lemon-oil/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in my classroom to clean surfaces at end of day; Citrus Limonum is antiseptic, antimicrobial, and bactericidal.  Plus the fragrance is wonderful!</li>
            <li> I usually purchase Sparks Naturals lemon oil (I am a big fan of lemon). I read the reviews and thought this may be a cheaper substitute - wrong. It doesn&#x27;t smell like fresh lemons. It smells almost like lemons past their prime or maybe slightly rotten lemon - I don&#x27;t know exactly but not good. I make lotions, scrubs and mix oils in my diffuser so I need pure, yummy scents. This product was delivered on time and in good shape but I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell. It may work in cleaning products or in some capacity where the smell isn&#x27;t the main feature but for me, smell is key.</li>
            <li> Oh. My. Lord. Seriously. This stuff is quite possibly the best smelling stuff on the planet. I have been using it EVERYWHERE!! I am a scent freak and I always want my house to smell fresh and clean- THis stuff is awesome!! I have been putting it on a wet towel in the dryer. I put several drops in the washer. I put some down the disposal to clean it. I put it in my seltzer water. I diluted it in a spray bottle and have been spraying my sofas. I put drops on my mattress. I put it on the light bulbs on my nightstands. I am even putting it along my part in my hair after I wash it!! IT SMELLS SO GOOD!! I am soooo glad I found a coupon code for this stuff! I will DEFINITELY be buying this again and again and again and again, etc, etc!!! I would give it 50 stars if I could!!</li>
            <li> This oil adds a clean refreshing scent to whatever it is used for. It has a convenient glass dropper for even application of the oil, a little goes a long way.  I have used it in water for a spray to freshen up the bathroom, and straight by putting a few drops on a dried up air freshener stick!  Their is no cleaner, fresher scent than the smell of lemons!! Happy to review this promotional product which I am very pleased with</li>
            <li> Love the scent and I use this to add to my cleansers for my home.</li>
