            <li> Liz Taylor&#x27;s PASSION has been my &amp;#34;signature scent&amp;#34; for many years now.  I always get complements when I wear it.  The department stores don&#x27;t always carry the body powder, so I decided to order 2.  Glad I did - just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my mom.  I bought it a little late in December.  I thought that it wasn&#x27;t going to get here in time for me to give it to her.  It came the day of out family Christmas get together.  I opened the box to make sure that everything looked ok and I was very surprised.  Not only did we get the powders, we also got some sample products and coupons in the box along with a nail care buffer and filer advertising the company that I ordered it from.  My mom loves her gift.  I&#x27;ll probably be ordering from FragranceNET again.  I am very impressed and satisfied with this order!</li>
